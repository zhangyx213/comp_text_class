THEY MAY BE famous - but they sure ain't pretty.
The Boston Phoenix has compiled a list of "100 Unsexiest Men in the World," a list of what it says are the "least sexy males on the planet."
Topping the list is Gilbert Gottfried, the gawky comedian who once pretended to give a cat a vasectomy as co-host of "USA Up All Night."
"The parrot-voiced, pickle-faced comic is to sexy what Kryptonite is to Superman," the Phoenix said. Ouch!
Yankees pitcher Randy Johnson, movie critic Roger Ebert, Dr. Phil and Fox television host Alan Colmes rounded out the top-five "least sexy."
"If he couldn't throw a ball 100miles per hour, Johnson would be wearing a wife-beater and getting hauled into a squad car on 'Cops,'" the Phoenix wrote.
But don't take it too hard, guys - most people would say you're in some good company.
Brad Pitt, for example, was named No.100 least sexiest. "He may look good, but if the rumors about his hygiene and BO issues are true, then he's probably not worth it," the Phoenix said.
Other debatable choices include Nickelback rock group front man Chad Kroeger (No.6), Jerry Seinfeld (17), Paris Latsis (41) and Clay Aiken (59).
"Tom from Myspace" was No.79. "What, you gotta be everybody's friend?"
The list also includes sports figures (Scottie Pippen, Grady Little, Hideki Matsui), singers (Kevin Federline, Mike D. of the Beastie Boys, Axl Rose, Michael Jackson) and politicians (Joe Lieberman, John Ashcroft, Newt Gingrich).
Also making the list was Yankees owner George Steinbrenner. "Come on, we live in Boston, you knew it was coming," the authors wrote.
Two male staffers, Bill Jensen and Ryan Stewart, took votes from "hundreds of people, both male and female, to compile the list," according to an editor's note on the Phoenix's Web site.
