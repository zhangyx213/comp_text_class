Goliath was a giant. Now it's a Six Flags ride. The first one fell down when a boy threw some stones. Makes me wonder who names things around here.
I voted for Cynthia four times on Tuesday and she still lost.
A big thank you to the British! We are so grateful to have you as our greatest ally.
My wife is a low-down cheat. This baby she soon will have was conceived two months after I had a vasectomy I never told her about.
Let us all join together, no matter our race, creed, beliefs or political party to have U.S. Rep. Cynthia McKinney appointed U.S. ambassador to Antarctica.
What a great day for me! Two Vents published, plus I found out my husband's girlfriend is cheating on him.
Too bad Cynthia lost before she could get that groundbreaking Tupac Shakur legislation passed.
Just when I think the Democrats couldn't get any dumber, they vote out one of their most outstanding, intelligent leaders, Joe Lieberman.
If you do not know which lane on 78 is the turn lane, either stay off it altogether or don't make any left turns!
I found an entire case of bottled water in the trash and when I asked my wife why she threw it out, she replied "It's past its expiration date." Yep, she's blond.
My car was stolen, then it was recovered, and then I waited three hours to get a release to get my car, and then I had to pay $135 to get it out of the tow yard. I got ripped off twice!
It is well to remember the last words of Thorin, King under the Mountain: "If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world."
I am all for gun control. I intend to purchase and control a few more.
I've lived in the South all my life and never knew until now that chow chow was anything but a dog with a lot of hair.
You think gas is expensive? Look at printer ink cartridges. They cost between $1,000 to $2,000 per quart of ink.
Dear Doctors: I don't want your free drug samples, but I would like the Braves tickets, expensive gifts and elegant dinners that the drug reps bribe you with. Wanna share those?
An American Embassy takeover and hostages held for 444 days. You call that better results?
Is Lenox Square really square?
I am an African-American DeKalb resident. There is not a yarmulke in my home, yet I voted for Hank. Cynthia, you lost because a majority is tired of your hate-filled, race-baiting tirades. Please go away!
The total absence of hurricanes this year proves we have entered a long period of global cooling. We need higher-polluting vehicles immediately.
Why is it that cable news will show video of members of Cynthia McKinney's entourage making racist comments and calling Hank Johnson an Uncle Tom, but the local media, TV and print ignore it?
You speed on the interstate? OK. You speed on the feeder roads. Well, OK. But don't speed through your neighborhood. You could hit children, joggers or pets.
DeKalb County leads the metro area in unsafe schools by a landslide. Now their back-to-school rally features the two convicted criminals kicked off "American Idol." As an educator, I find this appalling.
Cynthia McKinney learned one trick from the Republicans. She blamed her loss on the media.
