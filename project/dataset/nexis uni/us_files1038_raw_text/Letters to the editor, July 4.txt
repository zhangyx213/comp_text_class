Greitens' personal behavior already disqualifies him
In "Greitens resigned in disgrace. Here's why he leads in Missouri's US Senate race." (June 26), Laddonia, Missouri farmer Tony Hoyt supports U.S. Senate candidate Eric Greitens because, he says, "For me, it's the fact that Democrats hate him." That is not a valid reason why anyone should vote for a candidate for any office.
As a social conservative, I am extremely disappointed and disgusted that Greitens is Republicans' leading candidate in the primary. Greitens resigned his governorship in disgrace rather than be impeached. Additionally, he is an admitted adulterer who had a documented affair with his hairdresser that included allegedly perverted, handcuffed escapades all while being married with two young children. He also reportedly took pictures of his mistress and tried to blackmail her for her silence.
Greitens is also in a custody battle with his ex-wife, Sheena. She's accused him of abusing her and their young boys. In my opinion, his recent controversial "RINO" hunting campaign video is further evidence that he might have some mental health issues.
I believe elected officials have an obligation to conduct themselves and represent their constituents with decorum and, I believe, to have a personal life that is beyond reproach. If Greitens is indeed the winner of our Republican primary, this Republican will vote with the left because I despise him.

Danforth's candidate might not be very independent
Regarding "John Wood, former Jan. 6 investigator, launches independent bid for U.S. Senate in Missouri" (June 29): I can't believe I just saw former Sen. John Danforth in a TV political ad shilling for his new Republican choice for the Senate. I want to like Danforth. His family created Ralston Purina, his brother is the faceplate of Washington University.
But he gave us Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and Sen. Josh Hawley. Now he wants to give us John Wood, an "independent" (read Republican) Senate candidate? I wonder how independent Wood would be. How will he bring Missouri together? Wood used to clerk for Thomas. I wonder if that is a clue.

Women aren't Missouri property and still enjoy freedoms
Regarding "Page backs $1 million St. Louis County plan to help residents get out-of-state abortions" (June 30): I am not the property of the state in which I reside. As such, I have the liberty to travel state to state. I also have the liberty to spend my money as I please or give it to whom I choose. I have the liberty to do anything that is legal in a state I visit. None of the above is a crime.
Should I decide to give my money to someone who chooses to travel to another state for a legal abortion, that's not criminal. Last I checked, this is the United States, not the old Soviet Union.

Use Rams settlement money to clean up St. Louis streets
Regarding "Complaints about trash pickup in St. Louis keep piling up. Like the trash." (June 24): While driving north on Interstate 55 recently, I was amazed at the trash on the roadway. It seemed that the moment I crossed into the St. Louis city limits, it appeared that a trash truck had lost its load. But I soon realized that was not the case because I soon observed a desk chair, a small mattress and numerous other pieces of trash littering the interstate. What a welcome site out of town visitors first notice when entering our great city.
Considering that St. Louis has millions from the Rams/NFL settlement, how about using some of it to beautify the city before the politicians figure a way to line their pockets?

Coach might have been praying to express his gratitude
Regarding the editorial "In its latest partisan ruling, the high court erodes church-state separation" (June 27): Why vilify the Supreme Court for backing a coach merely because he chose to pray? The editorial characterizes the practice as "an inherently coercive exercise against non-Christian players."
I assume that the prayer was a display of gratitude and an opportunity for any player to offer thanks for the privilege of being able to participate in a sport. The editorial also notes that one player felt coerced. The Editorial Board has noted the erosion of church-state separation and calls this "Christian proselytizing to an effective captive audience." Could it be just a man expressing gratitude, a virtue we seem to have lost?

Force all male sex criminals to undergo vasectomies
Regarding "Biden backs filibuster exception to protect abortion access" (June 30): It would be nice to know that we are getting help from powerful men who have worked to overturn Roe v. Wade. I believe some unwanted pregnancies might be eliminated if these steps are taken: Any man convicted of rape/sodomy or child moelstation would be provided with a mandatory vasectomy within 30 days of conviction. After serving their sentence, they would have the legal right to have the procedure reversed. I'm told it doesn't hurt too much. About like giving birth.

Neman's Wednesday food columns will be sorely missed
Regarding "Neman: Confessions of a departing food writer" (June 30): I just read Dan Neman's last column in Let's Eat about how he is leaving that section to become a business writer. His column and the comic pages are the two reasons I get the Post-Dispatch delivered to my house. They are why we continue to subscribe. I used to look forward to my Wednesday mornings to read his column, which always left me with a smile. I am not sure how the newspaper will replace him.
