Surely you've heard of the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest, a competition to create really, really bad writing that's been going on for more than 25 years. It's named for George Bulwer-Lytton, a Victorian novelist who penned the opening line "It was a dark and stormy night" before it was a cliche that everyone chuckled over.
The idea is to write a spectacularly bad opening sentence of a novel that's so bad it's wonderful in its badness. Here is the 2008 winner, from Garrison Spik of Washington, D.C.
"Theirs was a New York love, a checkered taxi ride burning rubber, and like the city their passion was open 24/7, steam rising from their bodies like slick streets exhaling warm, moist, white breath through manhole covers stamped Forged by DeLaney Bros., Piscataway, N.J."
And I particularly liked this one, in the Detective category, from Robert B. Robeson of Lincoln, Neb.:
"Mike Hummer had been a private detective so long he could remember Preparation A, his hair reminded everyone of a rat who'd bitten into an electrical cord, but he could still run faster than greased owl snot when he was on a bad guy's trail, and they said his friskings were a lot like getting a vasectomy at Sears."
Full list of winners is here ().
