In a humorous new book on fatherhood, journalist and dad-of-three Michael Lewis describes men who have had vasectomies as "gelded" and "neutered" and says he emerged from his own as "a hero to my wife" and "a traitor to my sex."
The essay, in Home Game: An Accidental Guide to Fatherhood, is funny. But it's clear Lewis, like many men, was seriously uncomfortable with his vasectomy, a minor surgery with a major image problem.
Decades after vasectomy became common, it remains widely unloved, doctors say. That's despite the fact that the quick operation, which involves snipping tiny internal tubes that transport sperm, is an almost-infallible form of birth control.
"We've had a long-term struggle trying to sell vasectomy," says Charles Wilson, founder of the Vasectomy Clinic in Seattle. Still, Wilson is among doctors who have seen a boom in vasectomies recently, probably due to the recession. He says he has been performing as many as 140 a month, up from a typical 100.
Lawrence Ross, a professor of urology at the University of Illinois-Chicago, says: "We're  seeing about twice as many men coming in for vasectomy consultations as we did a year ago."
But experts say vasectomy remains much less popular than sterilization surgeries for women. In 2002,  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found half of women using birth control at ages 40 to 44 had  had sterilization surgery, but fewer than 20% of their male partners had.
"Traditionally, the burden has fallen on the woman," Ross says. "But  vasectomy is a much safer, simpler operation." So why isn't it more common? Doctors offer several reasons:
*Men are generally less comfortable with  medical procedures than women are. "These are young, healthy men who just don't see doctors regularly," Wilson says.
*Men are especially uncomfortable when a  procedure involves their sexual organs. "They get all sweaty just thinking about it," Wilson says.
*Myths about vasectomy persist. The biggest, doctors say, is that it will lower testosterone levels and affect sexual function and desire. "We still spend a lot of time explaining that there is absolutely no effect on sexual function or libido," Ross says.
Still, many men do choose vasectomy and recommend it to friends.  "The most effective education is buddy-to-buddy," Wilson says. "The more we do and the more men talk about it, the more comfortable other guys get."
Some men end up regretting sterilization surgery, just as some women do. But the numbers who seek a reversal -- a more complicated, expensive operation, usually not covered by insurers -- are unknown. "The usual number that is bandied about is 10%, but we do not have a good source for that," says Jonathan Jarow, a urologist at Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions in Baltimore.
The typical reversal patient is a divorced father who wants more children with a new wife, Ross says. Reversal requests are down right now, as are requests for other expensive fertility procedures.
The fact that vasectomy rates are suddenly soaring, at least in some places (Jarow says he sees no increase in Baltimore), probably does not reflect a major long-term shift, Wilson says. He guesses most men getting the surgery now would have it eventually anyway. But men fearing lost jobs and health insurance might be acting more quickly.
"It's on a lot of guys' lists to do this," but it usually ranks low, he says. "If it gets near the top, they decide it's time to paint the house instead."
