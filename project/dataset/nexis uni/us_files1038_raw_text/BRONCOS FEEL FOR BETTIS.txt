Keith Burns, the Broncos' special-teams captain, remembers when a unified Denver won in Three Rivers Stadium in the 1997 season to send John Elway to a Super Bowl where victory so evaded him earlier in his storybook career. They won the AFC championship and the big bowl again the next season, Elway's last.
So Burns -- one of several Denver holdovers from that 24-21 Broncos victory Jan. 11, 1998, along with center Tom Nalen, receiver Rod Smith and kicker Jason Elam -- can feel for many of the Steelers' desire to get Jerome Bettis to his hometown Detroit for Super Bowl XL and what could be a storybook ending to his career.
"I would love to see it," Burns said of Bettis' homecoming, "but just not at our expense."
A Broncos license plate?
Columnist Mark Kiszla broke the news in the Denver Post yesterday that Broncos officials are asking the Colorado state legislature to approve an orange-and-blue license plate for state residents who want to represent their team, in a design including that trademark horse head, on their vehicles.
"I think it's outrageous. It's absurd. It's arrogant. You do wonder: What's next?" he quoted Denver activist Jason Salzman, president of Cause Communications. "It's bad enough there is a taxpayer-supported stadium that we built for the Broncos. Why not get the legislature to promote the Broncos directly?
"[And] it could create a safety hazard. Because when the Broncos lose, there might be cars of upset fans slamming into each other."
Proceeds from the sales of the $25 plates would go to Broncos charities.
1 Ring = 1 seat
The ticket search continues to get wacky. Even beyond a Fort Collins, Col., physician's offering a free vasectomy -- value: $800 -- in exchange for tickets to the Steelers-Broncos game, a suburban Arvada man has offered to trade a half-carat diamond ring for seats, valued at $2,195. The man, a Steelers fan identified only as Scott (so as not to disrupt his marriage), bought the ring as a Valentine's Day gift for his unwitting wife.
What's up, 'Dawgs
Steelers receiver Hines Ward and Broncos cornerback Champ Bailey were teammates at Georgia and remain close friends today.
But not tomorrow.
"We'll talk and mess around a little bit; he's a good guy," Bailey said. "I respect his game.
"But he knows when that whistle blows it doesn't matter. We are going at each other's throats."
Bailey, a Pro Bowl cornerback who tied for the NFL lead with two interception returns for touchdowns and ranked fourth with eight interceptions, was described this way by coach Mike Shanahan yesterday: "He does things most human beings can't do."
