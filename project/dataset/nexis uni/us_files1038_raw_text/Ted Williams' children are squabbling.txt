The Boston Red Sox announced plans yesterday for a celebration of Ted Williams' life as his family fought over what to do with his remains.
Bobby Jo Farrell, Williams' daughter from his first marriage, said she would seek a court injunction today to stop her half brother, John Henry Williams, from trying to have their father's body or DNA frozen.
"I will rescue my father's body," she said.
Williams, the last major-league hitter to bat better than .400, died Friday at the age of 83 in a hospital near his home in West-Central Florida. According to his wishes, no funeral will be held. The memorial service will be July 22 at Fenway Park.
"My father's body was put on a plane [Friday] with people from Alcor," his daughter said, referring to Alcor Life Extension Foundation, a cryonics company. "I'm imagining they were trying to keep it quiet."
John Henry Williams did not return calls seeking comment.
The executive board of the players' union will meet today in a Chicago suburb and is likely to discuss a walkout. Players fear owners will change baseball's economic rules after the postseason, and the union's most likely defense is an August strike - replicating what happened in 1994.
The Montreal Expos are trying to close another trade to get Cliff Floyd and Ryan Dempster from the Florida Marlins. The Expos also are discussing a deal that would bring them righthander Orlando Hernandez from the New York Yankees.
Montreal boosted its postseason chances June 27 by getting pitcher Bartolo Colon from Cleveland. To add Floyd to their outfield and Dempster to their rotation, the Expos discussed trading pitchers Masato Yoshii and Graeme Lloyd and three prospects to the Marlins, two people familiar with the talks said yesterday, speaking on the condition they not be identified.
Bobby Higginson is angry that Detroit dealt Jeff Weaver to the Yankees during the weekend.
"It was a terrible trade," the Tigers leftfielder, a former Frankford and Temple player, told the Detroit News and the Detroit Free Press. "We just traded a No. 1 starter who's 25 years old and wanted to stay here."
Oakland sent first baseman Carlos Pena, righthander Franklyn German and a player to be named to Detroit for Weaver, who was traded to New York for lefthander Ted Lilly, minor-league outfielder John-Ford Griffin and righthanded minor-league pitcher Jason Arnold.
Seventy-nine percent of major-league players would agree to independent testing for steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs, according to a survey by USA Today.
Forty-four percent of the 750 players polled last month in the survey, published in today's editions, said they felt pressure to take steroids.
The Charleston (S.C.) Riverdogs will padlock the gates tonight and hold a party, including discounted food and beer, outside the ballpark in an attempt to set the record for the lowest attendance at a professional baseball game on "Nobody Night." The Riverdogs will play the Columbus RedStixx.
Team owner and promotional guru Mike Veeck has a history of outlandish promotions, including "Vasectomy Night" - canceled at the last minute - and "Tonya Harding Bat Day."
Sammy Sosa missed his third straight game yesterday because of a family emergency but still plans to play in the All-Star Game.
A Cubs spokesman said Sosa's wife hurt her hand in a household accident and was scheduled for surgery today.
Frank Thomas, unhappy with being benched, missed the Chicago White Sox' pre-game stretch.
