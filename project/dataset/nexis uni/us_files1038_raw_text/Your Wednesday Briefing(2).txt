Israeli media respond to the possible fall of Netanyahu
After more than 12 consecutive years at the helm of Israel’s government, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s hold on power may be coming to a close. Naftali Bennett, an ultranationalist power broker, said he would cooperate with opposition leaders to form a coalition to replace Netanyahu.
