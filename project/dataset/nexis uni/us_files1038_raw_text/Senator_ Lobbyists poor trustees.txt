Today is the 36th day of the 60-day session.
A Republican state senator voted against seven of Gov. Jeb Bush's choices for university trustees Monday because they are lobbyists.
Sen. Alex Diaz de la Portilla, R-Miami, said lobbyists "have undue influence" and "corrupt the process" and should not be allowed to make policy.
He voted against confirmation of Florida State University trustees Lee Hinkle, John Thrasher and Steve Uhlfelder; Florida Atlantic University's Jorge Dominicis; Miriam Lopez of Florida International; and Carol Dover of the University of West Florida. All lobby for clients unrelated to the university system.

Three months ago, Diaz de la Portilla was slapped with a $ 311,000 fine for repeated election law violations. He said the violations were unintentional and that he was the victim of a "political assassination" because he clashed with two lobbyists on the commission. Diaz de la Portilla then filed a bill (SB 1696) to stop lobbyists from serving on the Florida Elections Commission and transferring the commission to the Attorney General's Office.
Told by a reporter that Florida A&M University trustee Arthur Collins is a lobbyist, Diaz de la Portilla later made a motion to reject him, too.
His opposition did not affect the outcome. The Senate Education Committee confirmed all of the trustees, who now must be confirmed by the full Senate.

Short insurance menu okayed
A Senate committee approved legislation giving employers an option to buy cheaper insurance that doesn't cover a number of conditions now required by state law.
"Less and less, employers are providing coverage to their employees," said Sen. Jim King, R-Jacksonville, whose bill was among three in a group approved by the Senate Banking and Insurance Committee. "They simply can't afford to."
King said the streamlined coverage, which would exclude cleft palate, mammograms, vasectomies and extended maternity stays among other things, could fix part of the affordability problem. "At least that employer would have some coverage."
The measure also provides for a pilot program to provide health care coverage for uninsured, low-income people.
The bill (CS SB 1286) has three more committee stops. A similar measure (HB 913) awaits floor action in the House.
The House version ignited a firestorm last month when a committee hearing ended with several people screaming at the chairman, Rep. Frank Farkas, R-St. Petersburg.
Farkas took a vote on his bill without taking testimony from several people who were concerned they will lose health coverage if the bill passes. They got their say at a subsequent committee meeting.
Several people also testified for and against the Senate measure. It now goes to the Health, Aging and Long Term Care Committee.

Nursing home panel meets
A special House committee, holding its first meeting with just three weeks left in the session, heard testimony on the availability of nursing home insurance.
Faced with warnings about a flood of lawsuits chasing nursing home insurers out of the state, lawmakers last year capped damages, made it harder for residents or their families to prove negligence and required more staff in nursing homes.
Speaker Tom Feeney, R-Oviedo, last week created the Select Committee on Liability Insurance for Long Term Care Facilities to check into industry complaints that insurance is still too hard to find.
A lawyer with the Academy of Florida Trial Attorneys reminded lawmakers Monday that it has been just "50 days" since all the provisions of the 2001 law took effect. "The law is already working but we need to give it more time," Frank Petosa said.
Rep. Dudley Goodlette, R-Naples, who heads the panel, said lawmakers would not rush into any action.
The committee will try to sort out whether a short-term solution to help nursing homes is needed, Goodlette said.
Larry Polivka, with the Florida Policy Exchange Center on Aging, and Lyn Bodiford, with the AARP, told lawmakers they thought it was to soon to regard the insurance situation as a crisis needing action.

ENVIRONMENTAL DEBATE WARMING UP: Helen Spivey, left, co-chairwoman of the Save the Manatee Club, and Susie Caplowe, Sierra Club spokeswoman, were among conservationists who announced plans at a news conference Monday to put more pressure on a Legislature they say favors developers and is unwilling to protect the environment. Business and agriculture lobbyists are pushing for two packages of bills making it more difficult for people to challenge industries they think would pollute the environment. Opponents say passage of the bills would amount to a partial rollback of the Florida Environmental Protection Act of 1971, which allows anyone to challenge an agency action seen as damaging to the environment.
