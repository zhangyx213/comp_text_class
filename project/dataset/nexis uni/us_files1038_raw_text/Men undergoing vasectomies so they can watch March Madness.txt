DON'T KNOW about you, but if I want to watch any part of March Madness at home, I don't need an excuse to do so. Just turn on the TV, hope I have a rooting interest - either a Philly 6 team or a school one of my kids attended - check my brackets, and into basketball heaven I go. 
Apparently, though, others who want to take a 4-day leave from work are getting - men, brace yourselves - a vasectomy as a way out. 
March Madness and vasectomy are apparently the latest coupling. Who'da thought? 
A vasectomy is a half-hour procedure, but the recovery time is 3 to 4 days. Men are told to stay off their feet for at least 2 days and apply ice - usually a frozen bag of peas - to the affected area. Other than a little discomfort, this allows the men to take a resting spot on their couch or favorite recliner, have the family cater to them during recovery and watch all the games they want uninterrupted. 
Most vasectomies, year-round, are performed on Thursdays and Fridays anyway, allowing for the weekend to recover. But the requests spike right around the middle of March. 
According to CNN, a major clinic in Ohio reports it performs 40 or 50 more vasectomies a month before and during the 68-team basketball tourney. 
"We do have [in March] typically about 50 percent more vasectomies than in other months," Dr. Ed Sabanegh, chairman of the Department of Urology at the Cleveland Clinic, told CNN. "A lot of patients come in and say, 'I have to have this during March Madness, you have to talk to my wife about it. Tell her what my limitations are and that I need to be on the couch.' 
"They'll even tell us to exaggerate a little about how long it takes to recover." 
Some doctors have cashed in on this new fad, providing special deals for a March snipping. 
Urology Ltd., of Elgin, Ill., offered a "3-Point Shot" plan - one vasectomy, one free pizza and one weekend excuse to watch college basketball, the Daily Herald of Elgin reported. 
I'd rather buy my own favorite pizza and not use a frozen bag of peas while watching basketball, but, hey, that's me.
