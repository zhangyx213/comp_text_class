The charge against the accused killer of Linda Jensen in Big Lake Township has been increased to first-degree murder, and authorities are seeking more medical evidence in the case, it was disclosed Thursday.
      A Sherburne County grand jury has returned a first-degree murder indictment against Kent R. Jones, who was arrested last month in the 1992 rape and fatal stabbing of Jensen.
     The indictment was disclosed at a hearing in Elk River before Judge Alan Pendleton.
   The first-degree charge alleges murder "while committing or attempting to commit criminal sexual conduct in the first degree with force or violence." If convicted, he could face a life sentence without parole.
     When he was arrested, Jones, 37, was charged with second-degree murder.
     Also Thursday, Ramsey County District Court made public a search warrant by the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) seeking medical records and subsequent treatment for a vasectomy allegedly performed on Jones by Dr. Neil Steine at Metropolitan Urology Specialists in St. Paul.
     The records "will aid in determining whether Kent Richard Jones had a vasectomy before or after the date of Linda Jensen's death and was capable of production or deposition of sperm in February of 1992," when she was killed, the search warrant said.
     Jones, a St. Cloud car salesman who lived about a half-mile from the Jensen family at the time of the killing, was arrested in late July after DNA samples taken from him matched semen found at the crime scene, according to the Sherburne County Sheriff's Office.
      County Attorney Walter Kaminsky confirmed that the vasectomy records were obtained and presented to the grand jury, but he declined to say when Jones had his vasectomy.
     It was disclosed in court Thursday that the grand jury also indicted Jones on one count of intentional second-degree murder and one count of first-degree criminal sexual conduct.
     The grand jury was in session for 4 1/2 days, Kaminsky said.
     Pendleton granted a motion by Kaminsky to remove hair samples from Jones. Kaminsky said that hairs were found at the crime scene and that the hair will be taken from Jones before Aug. 28.
     Kari Seime, the attorney representing Jones, said she is still awaiting what is anticipated to be a large volume of documents from the eight-year investigation of the case.
     Kaminsky said there are a "couple thousand" pages of reports on the case, and the number is growing because the investigation is continuing.
     Jones, who is being held in lieu of $1 million bail, has not yet entered a plea. The next hearing date in the case is set for Sept. 15.
