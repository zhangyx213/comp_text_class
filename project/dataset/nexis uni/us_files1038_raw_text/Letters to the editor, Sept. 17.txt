Get Medicaid expansion on the ballot in Missouri
The Legislature has mounted a sustained, multifront attack on the programs that help Missourians access health care and optimize their human potential.
Medicaid provides federally subsidized health care benefits to low-income adults, children, pregnant women, elderly adults and people with disabilities of any age. Medicare provides health care insurance for those over 65.
In 2010, federal coverage and funding were greatly expanded to include people who make too much to qualify for traditional Medicaid. Typically, they work in low-wage jobs that don't offer health insurance to them.
Each state can decide whether to adopt "expanded Medicaid." Despite the federal government picking up the vast majority of expanded Medicaid's cost to the state, our Legislature, citing financial concerns, has refused to offer this program to its citizens.
Advocates and voters have repeatedly warned members of the Legislature that their actions would have real consequences for Missourians - and the numbers confirm it:
- In 2016, Missouri was ranked in the bottom third of all states in terms of health insurance coverage.
- During 2017, the uninsured rate in Missouri rose another 2.1 percent, meaning some 128,000 people lost their health insurance last year.
- If Missouri adopted expanded eligibility, approximately 300,000 beneficiaries would be added.
- Missouri's failure to expand Medicaid results in devastating damage to our state's economy in terms of lost benefits, lost workforce productivity and effects to struggling rural hospitals.
If our state representatives choose to continually provide tax breaks to businesses instead of investing in the health and economic well-being of Missourians, then it's time for citizens to do the job themselves by passing Medicaid expansion as a ballot measure in 2020.

U.S. has to present a positive vision of democracy
The democratic way of life is sadly fading. Vladimir Putin's Russia is undermining democracy in the West, many fear the rise of a more aggressive China, and President Donald Trump's trade policies isolate us from other democracies.
Writer Daniel Nexon presented an alternative vision in a wonderful commentary in Foreign Affairs called "Toward a Neo-Progressive Foreign Policy," which presents a narrative where our country uses non-military instruments to advance the values of democratic societies.
What's so important about this narrative is how it ties our foreign policy in with our economy. If Putin's Russia aims to undermine democracy, then the United States has to present a positive vision of what democratic life is all about. Democratic life is about citizens taking control of their lives in both the political and economic spheres. If our country continues to be a model of oligarchy (similar to Russia), then it will not be a model for democratic life for those who don't experience it.
More generous social insurance and tax policies, universal health care, guaranteed vacation, an expanded earned income tax credit (to the middle class), and a housing tax credit (for those who rent and own) would redistribute the gains of globalization to the lower end of the income spectrum.
Once the democratic way of life wins, then our country can collaborate with other democracies in making a world governed by law.

Government shouldn't have power over reproductive rights
Do we really want the government to have control over a woman's reproductive rights? It seems to me that any entity that has the power to tell a woman she many not have an abortion also has the power to tell her she must have an abortion. Just two sides of the same coin: the all-powerful state.
And if the state has this power over a woman, how about a man? Can the government tell him he may not have a vasectomy, or that he must have a vasectomy?
Do we really want to give the government such power?

Hard to find the weather map in the paper
Thank you for printing the letter from Steve Holzer regarding the weather section ("Looking for signs of peace and quiet in the stars," Sept. 12). First, it was on the back page, and now it was moved to the inside so we can all page through the ads and some classifieds before finding the weather report.
Peace and quiet in the stars? That's hard to find in your paper.

Trump shouldn't try to compare national tragedies
Another day and another shameful tweet from President Donald Trump. At a time when his attention should be focused on Hurricane Florence and the devastation it brought to the East Coast, Trump was more concerned about a report attributing nearly 3,000 deaths to last year's hurricane in Puerto Rico.
There is nothing to be gained from comparing any of our national tragedies, whether they are from a terrorist attack, a school shooting or a hurricane. Officials study these events in the hope of finding ways to prevent them or to reduce the number of deaths that occur. Few people care who our president is during times of tragedy, or the political party to which each of us belongs. We want a leader who will unite our nation, who will provide the help necessary for victims to rebuild their lives, and who can show compassion and respect for the victims and their families as our nation mourns their loss.
Unfortunately, President Trump doesn't seem to be up to the task.

Commentary on social justice movement is insightful
