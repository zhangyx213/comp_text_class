If the right wing had their way this would be how the birth issue would be handled: 1) no birth control; 2) no abortions; 3) no social programs for newborns and children; 4) a generation of subpoverty children and homeless.
A goal to minimize abortions is noble. However, when it comes to health coverage, the right wing never challenges the male version of birth control (vasectomies) and has no problem with the distribution of Viagra, but birth control options for women are being challenged on every front. The right is boxing women in at every stage of the reproductive process leaving women no choice in their reproductive decisions.
What about countries like China where tens of millions of abortions are done yearly? The right has thrown pragmatism out the window and replaced it with voodoo-like theories and principles.
