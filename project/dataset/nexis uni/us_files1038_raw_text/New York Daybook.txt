Polish That Resume
Wednesday, 11 a.m. The indignity of losing a job is probably matched only by the indignity of trying to find one. That psychic ordeal is typically a process of extended humiliation wherein large doses of soul-selling are spoon-fed to employers whom you'd probably rather garrote than actually work for. It is not your fault that they hold all the cards; the American dream is real but cannot be obtained just by flattering business morons. It may not seem so, but your worth transcends your resume. Keep looking. The New York Career Fair, Radisson Martinique Hotel on Broadway, 49 West 32nd Street, Manhattan.
Architect, Philosopher
Thursday, 6 p.m. It is a tragedy of the talented to be defined by their defeats. Who remembers General Custer's glory as a cavalry commander with the Michigan Brigade? All that remains is the brutal Last Stand. So, too, in some sense, with Daniel Libeskind, the architect whose intractable creativity ran smack against the bureaucratic wall of the World Trade Center design project. Tonight, the architect discusses his latest book, ''Counterpoint,'' which explores how philosophy, art, music, literature and film inform his buildings. Except the big one, of course. 45th floor, 7 World Trade Center.
What Isn't Online?
Thursday, 7 p.m. As a New Yorker, you are no doubt worldly. You have tasted puffer fish, you have visited a Yanomamo Indian village, you have surely seen the Pyramids of Giza. One thing you have probably not done, however, is watched a live Webcast of a man having his vasectomy reversed. The time to rectify that gap in your experience is now. Dr. Harris M. Nagler, chairman of the department of urology at Beth Israel Medical Center, performs the operation live on the Internet -- and more important, on an unidentifiable patient. Order in.
Bugs, on Your Plate
Sunday, 1 p.m. One need do no more for this one than reproduce verbatim the promotional slug posted under ''Things to Do'' on the Web site of the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation: ''Step out of your comfort zone and discover a new food! Insects are part of the everyday diets of millions of people around the world. They are fried, broiled, boiled, barbecued, and much more. Join us for an afternoon of insect tasting, including chocolate-chip cricket cookies and more!'' At the risk of sounding stupid, that's why we live in America and not ''around the world.'' 700 Rockland Avenue at Brielle Avenue, Staten Island.ALAN FEUER

Correction: February 19, 2009, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A daybook listing in the City Room column in some editions on Monday about a talk by Daniel Libeskind, the architect, on his latest book misstated his nationality. He was born in Poland and became an American citizen in 1965; he is not German.
