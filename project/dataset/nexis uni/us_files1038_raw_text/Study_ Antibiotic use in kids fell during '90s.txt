Antibiotic prescriptions for children fell by 40 percent over the course of the 1990s, reversing an upward trend that had fueled the emergence of hard-to-treat, drug-resistant bacteria, researchers reported Tuesday.
The dramatic reversal was seen across the spectrum of common ailments of childhood, including ear infections, sore throats, bronchitis and miscellaneous respiratory infections. It was seen in all ways that drug prescribing is gauged: total number of prescriptions, prescriptions per child and prescriptions per trip to the doctor.

The change follows numerous public health campaigns aimed at doctors and parents, widespread media coverage of "superbugs" and a few examples of death from bacterial infections that once would have been easily cured.
The national survey results appear in today's Journal of the American Medical Association.
 
No prostate cancer link
 
to vasectomies is found
Contrary to some earlier evidence, a new study finds that men who have a vasectomy don't have an increased risk of developing prostate cancer.
"There was no association between prostate cancer and vasectomy, nor with time since vasectomy," said Brian Cox, a researcher at New Zealand's University of Otago and lead author of the study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
While there is no biological explanation for why vasectomy might increase the risk of cancer in the prostate gland, a few studies done in the early 1990s suggested there was a moderately increased chance, particularly in men who had the surgery in their 20s or 30s. Other researchers found no increased risk.
The study involved more than 2,200 men aged 40 to 74, about half newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients, the rest randomly selected from males registered to vote.
 
New arthritis drug may be
 
better for stomach, heart
LONDON - A new type of anti-inflammatory painkiller is showing promise in experiments on people with arthritic knees.
Research presented at the European Congress of Rheumatology in Stockholm this month indicated the drug works just as well for arthritis as traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen, but is gentler on the stomach.
Experts say the medication, licofelone, could offer an alternative to newer arthritis drugs, such as Vioxx and Celebrex, which have recently come under suspicion of increasing heart risks.
The yearlong study, involving 710 people with arthritic knees, found that licofelone, being developed by German pharmaceutical manufacturer Merckle, worked as well as the older drugs, was gentle on the stomach and showed no trace of side effects that could cause heart problems.
 
Abuse-proof OxyContin?
 
Not this year, maker says
WASHINGTON - An abuse-resistant form of the powerful but controversial painkiller OxyContin won't be ready next year as its manufacturer had hoped.
When swallowed whole, one tablet provides 12 hours of pain relief for many patients suffering long-term moderate to severe pain from cancer or other illnesses. But if chewed, inhaled or injected, Oxycontin produces a quick - and potentially lethal - heroinlike high. It has been linked to more than 100 deaths.
Manufacturer Purdue Pharma is trying to create abuse-resistant forms by adding drugs that would block the buzz if OxyContin is taken the wrong way.
But Tuesday, Purdue Pharma announced that clinical trials found, among other problems, that the substance it added, naloxone, sometimes blocked pain relief for patients who took the combination tablets correctly. Purdue Pharma said it won't seek Food and Drug Administration approval this year.
