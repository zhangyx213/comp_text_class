Couples having second thoughts about a would-be daddy's vasectomy, take heart: If he gets the job reversed, you could be changing diapers before too long.
But there's a twist: To become parents, you both may have to really want that baby.
Men who got their vasectomies reversed using microsurgery and remained with the same wife or girlfriend were much more likely to get her pregnant and have a child afterward than men who underwent the procedure after divorcing and remarrying, according to a new study published in the journal Fertility and Sterility.
Though the reasons why are unclear, study author Dr. Marc Weinstein has several theories.
One possibility is that among the couples who stayed together, there was a shorter time period between the man's vasectomy and its reversal. Another is that those couples already had proven themselves capable of having children, and the third is that they might be more determined to have a child, especially if they'd lost one before.
"The majority of my patients who come for reversal are couples where the man has been divorced [and] remarried. Usually it's a woman who's significantly younger, who's never had children, and since the man has usually had children before, often I've noticed there's some ambivalence on the part of the man, less so than on the part of the female," said Weinstein, surgeon in chief of male reproductive medicine and microsurgery at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center.
On the other hand, with the longtime couples, "especially where it's a loss of a child, they're both totally dedicated to having another child and there's usually no ambivalence," Weinstein said. "Maybe they time it better, maybe they have relations more frequently."
Weinstein said that while men should always have a vasectomy with the understanding that it is permanent, the study demonstrates that the right microsurgery offers "good options for having more children."
