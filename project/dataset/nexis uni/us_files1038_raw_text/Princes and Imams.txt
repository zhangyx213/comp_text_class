THE MEDIA RELATIONS DEPARTMENT OF HIZBOLLAH WISHES YOU A HAPPY BIRTHDAY
  Unexpected Encounters in the Changing Middle East
  By Neil MacFarquhar
  387 pp. PublicAffairs. $26.95
  In this engaging and fact-filled reporter's memoir, Neil MacFarquhar successfully walks a fine line. He offers something fresh and unexpected for readers steeped in a decade of news reports about suicide bombers, absolutist imams and tyrannical despots. Yet he never forgets that most of those readers care about the subject only because they have already decided, perhaps simplistically, that they are under threat from the Arab or Muslim world. He nods to the prejudices about Middle Eastern fanatics and then sets off merrily to dispel them.
  Like many of us, MacFarquhar desperately wants to make sense of some burning questions: How come the flood of petrodollars in the Persian Gulf has produced so little intellectual innovation and sustainable development? How can political reform and economic liberalization coexist with resurgent Islamism? Can the United States act as a force for change in Iran and the Arab countries, or has it lost its leverage? ''The Media Relations Department of Hizbollah Wishes You a Happy Birthday'' is MacFarquhar's effort to write a funny (yet penetrating) account about real Arabs -- and a few Persians -- struggling against long odds to bring their societies into the modern age. 
  MacFarquhar is well positioned for the attempt. He grew up in the 1960s in Marsa Brega, a fenced-off expatriate oil outpost on the Libyan coast where local food was never served. After studying international relations at Stanford, he returned to the Middle East, spurred by a powerful curiosity. He covered the region in the 1980s for The Associated Press and was the Cairo bureau chief for The New York Times from 2001 to 2005.
  He's a diligent reporter with eclectic interests. He drinks beer with a German brewer in Yemen. He is detained by regular police in Saudi Arabia and sips tea with the secret police in Egypt. He researches religious edicts against dogs at a reference library in Iran and questions an Egyptian cleric whose dial-a-fatwa service berates women reluctant to take the veil.
  How, MacFarquhar wants to know, have Arab tyrants and dictatorial Iranian ayatollahs succeeded at smothering almost every effort at reform? And why has the United States failed so dramatically to promote greater freedom? He argues, convincingly, that despots have won Washington's backing on a platform of ''apres moi, le deluge'' -- if popular uprisings sweep out friendly dictators in Cairo, Riyadh and Amman, far worse authoritarian Islamist movements will take their place. Meanwhile, hard-line clerics intoxicated by power have extended their authority over every aspect of daily life, with rulings, based on the Koran, on whether Muslims can ski or get vasectomies. Taken together, the twin oppression of princes and imams has eliminated the space for even a modest reform movement. This book reminds us thatmultitudes of the ruled share many of their leaders' values and assumptions even if they resent their heavy-handed and corrupt ways. Any change in the Middle East's powerhouses is very likely to come with an Islamic pedigree and to advocate incremental reform. 
  In the end, MacFarquhar embraces a tempered optimism. The characters he introduces fight at great personal risk for civil liberties, political transparency, freedom of worship, even for genuine political pluralism. They give the lie to the misleading claim that democracy is somehow incompatible with Arab culture. For those who care about the Middle East and want to start listening to weak but growing voices calling for reform and modernization on local rather than Western terms, MacFarquhar's account is a fine place to begin.h
