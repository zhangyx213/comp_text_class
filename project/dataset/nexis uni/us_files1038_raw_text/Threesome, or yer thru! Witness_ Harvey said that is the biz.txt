The Harvey Weinstein casting couch offered room for three.
 Dawn Dunning, testifying Wednesday in the Oscar winner's sexual abuse trial, detailed how the hulking moviemaker insisted that joining him for a ménage à trois was the best way to kickstart her career - and even cited actresses Salma Hayek and Charlize Theron as stars who had swapped sexual favors for good roles.
"He kind of just cut to the chase and said, 'Here's contracts for my next three films. I'll sign them today if you have a threesome with me and my assistant,' " the one-time aspiring actress recounted of her creepy encounter with Weinstein in the spring of 2004.
"I mean, when he said that, I kind of laughed. I thought he was kidding. He had kind of a crass sense of humor."
Dunning, who works in the fashion industry, recalled how she became more and more unnerved after realizing Weinstein was serious and angered by her lack of enthusiasm.
"He said, 'You'll never make it in this business! This is how the industry works!' " recalled Dunning about the bizarre encounter inside the Intercontinental Hotel in Manhattan. 
"And he named three actresses who got to where they are," Dunning said. "At that point, I was scared. I literally ran down the hall to the elevator. ... He was screaming."
Dunning was followed to the stand by Tarale Wulff, 43, a waitress who recounted how she was invited by Weinstein to audition for a movie part in 2005 - a tryout moved without explanation from a Greenwich Village office to the producer's SoHo loft. The pair had met at the restaurant Cipriani, where Weinstein was a customer and Wulff a member of the staff.
Once there, the situation made it clear that Weinstein had no interest in listening to Wulff read lines. Wulff testified that Weinstein took her by the arms, laid her on his bed and climbed on top of her.
"I told him 'I can't,' and he answered 'Don't worry, I had a vasectomy,'" recalled Wulff. "I just went blank ... as he put himself inside me and raped me."
Weinstein later gave the disoriented victim a ride back inside a hired car, and never said a word about the audition for a film titled "Pulse," according to Wulff. During testimony Monday, Weinstein accuser Miriam Haley testified about her sexual assault at the filmmaker's hands inside the very same apartment.
Dunning earlier recounted how she too was working as a cocktail waitress when she first met Weinstein, hoping he could provide her with a break into the business. 
Dunning said her experience with Weinstein convinced her to give up her dreams of acting.
Both women were called, as was actress Annabella Sciorra last week, to testify regarding Weinstein's prior bad acts as part of the Manhattan criminal case. 
Weinstein, 67, faces life behind bars if convicted on the top counts for his alleged sexual abuse of two New York women. 
Ninety women alleged they were sexually abused by the pervy producer.
Dunning was finally asked by prosecutor Meghan Hast if she had anything to gain by testifying against the Hollywood heavyweight.
"No, if anything I'm losing," she testified. "This is the worst and hardest thing I've ever done."
Weinstein, when asked outside of court what he told Dunning about Hayek and Theron, responded, "That's complete b---t."
