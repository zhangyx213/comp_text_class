THE BLACKBERRY failures sweeping across the globe hit the U.S. yesterday, exasperating users and hampering businesses dependent on the sullied smartphones.
The annoying glitches, which affect messaging, email and Internet services, struck North America after affecting Europe, Asia, Latin America and Africa.
Research in Motion Ltd., the Canadian company that makes the phones, attributed the disruptions to infrastructure problems in Europe and a backup system failure.
That led to a mountain of backlogged emails and other messages and RIM officials said they were able to restore some service last night.
That wasn't much comfort to hordes of frustrated BlackBerry users in New York and elsewhere.
"I run a business off of my BlackBerry, and I can't do anything," said Christine Giachetti, of the upper East Side, who owns an eco-friendly tote bag company.
"I think it's time to switch to the iPhone."
Loren Schneid, a consultant from Tribeca, was even more blunt.
"They're pieces of s--t as far as I'm concerned," said Schneid, 32. "They're a dying dog. They're just not keeping up with the whole consumer-friendly point of view that Apple has taken."
Several BlackBerry users took to Twitter to air their outrage.
"Dear BlackBerry, sort yourself out. You're meant to be a smartphone!" wrote a user with the Twitter handle, katierosejane.
"I have a #BlackBerry, but it doesn't work," wrote benwakeling. "The equipment's there, but it's useless. This must be what it feels like to have a vasectomy."
The outage has come at a perilous time for Research in Motion. The firm is under intense pressure from a series of rivals, including Apple, with stronger sales and splashier products on the market.
The bug first struck Europe, Africa and the Middle East on Monday. The next day, the data issues spread to BlackBerry customers in Brazil, India, Chile and Argentina.
Hours after the problems struck the U.S., Research in Motion's David Yach sought to calm nerves by announcing that there's no evidence of a hack or security breach.
Yach, the firm's chief technology officer for software, promised users no messages will be lost.
While the popular BlackBerry Messenger service was down, text messaging was not affected.
BlackBerry disruptions are not rare, but they typically don't last longer than a day.
By last night, there were signs the issues were easing, but some BlackBerry customers said it was too little, too late.
"Damn BlackBerry!" shouted CJ Johnson, a financial analyst from the Bronx, as she shook her phone. "I'm going to get an HTC [smartphone]."
