WASHINGTON -- Not long after President Trump took the oath of office, a busload of women's health advocates made the first of a series of 860-mile round trips from Las Vegas to the Nevada capital, Carson City. Their mission: to push state legislators to expand insurance coverage for contraception.
It worked. On Saturday, Gov. Brian Sandoval of Nevada, a Republican, signed a measure requiring insurers to cover 12 months of birth control at a time, with no co-payment. 
  Nevada is not the only state where birth control is suddenly on the legislative agenda. With the future of the Affordable Care Act -- former President Barack Obama's signature health care legislation -- in doubt and the Trump administration planning to roll back the act's mandate that employers cover contraceptives, the battle over birth control is shifting to the states.
  Currently, 28 states have some type of ''contraceptive equity'' law, aimed at making birth control cheaper and more accessible. Many of those measures -- including one in Nevada -- were adopted in the late 1990s. Mr. Trump's election has again brought the issue to the fore.
  ''We are on the cusp of seeing another push, a more aggressive push at the state level to protect affordable access to contraception, just like we saw in the late '90s when women realized Viagra was getting coverage and birth control wasn't,'' said Andrea Miller, president of the National Institute for Reproductive Health, a New York nonprofit that advocates for reproductive rights.
  ''The feds can set a floor,'' Ms. Miller said. ''States can decide to do better.''
  Several states are expanding access by requiring insurers to cover a year's supply of contraceptives at a time, as opposed to the customary three months. In Washington, Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, last month signed a bill that would do just that, and Colorado's Democratic governor, John Hickenlooper, signed a similar bill this week.
  Lawmakers in Massachusetts and New York are also considering ''contraceptive equity bills.'' In New York, Eric Schneiderman, the attorney general, has proposed far-reaching legislation that would cover all forms of birth control, including vasectomies, without co-pays and at no cost to the patient. (Obamacare does not require insurers to cover vasectomies.) The bill has passed the New York Assembly, but awaits action in the state senate.
  Mr. Schneiderman, a Democrat, called for similar legislation last year, but said in an interview that Mr. Trump's election increased his sense of urgency.
  ''We were anticipating this attack would come,'' he said.
  More than 55 million women now have access to free birth control under the Affordable Care Act, according to a study conducted by the Obama administration. But the Trump administration has drafted a far-reaching rule, leaked last week, that would greatly expand the number of employers and insurers that could qualify for exemptions from the birth control mandate by claiming a moral or a religious objection.
  For religious conservatives and anti-abortion advocates -- many of whom oppose the contraceptive coverage mandate because it includes drugs that they say can induce abortion -- the proposed rule was a welcome shift. Archbishop William E. Lori of Baltimore, in a statement issued on behalf of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, called the draft ''encouraging news.''
  But hundreds of thousands of women, many of them poor, could lose access to no-cost birth control if the rule goes into effect. For women like Tacy Geesaman, a 34-year-old mother of two in Las Vegas, who took one of the lobbying bus trips to Carson City, and is contemplating a run for public office, the Trump administration's draft rule is a call to action.
  ''I feel like religion should be a nonissue in protecting women's rights to have affordable birth control,'' Ms. Geesaman said. ''Women's rights are on the line.''
  The Affordable Care Act, which passed in 2010, did not explicitly call for insurers to provide birth control free of charge; it called for ''preventive services,'' like mammograms, to be offered without co-pays.
  But the Obama administration interpreted ''preventive services'' as including birth control; insurers are now required to cover 18 birth control methods approved by the Food and Drug Administration, including birth control pills, implantable devices and so-called morning after contraceptives, at no cost to the patient.
  A series of lawsuits filed over the last five years by priests, nuns, charitable organizations, hospitals, advocacy groups and others helped chip away at the contraceptive coverage requirement. In 2014, the Supreme Court ruled that family-owned businesses could not be forced to pay for coverage that included contraception if doing so violated the business owners' religious beliefs.
  That same year, California became the first state to pass birth control legislation codifying Obamacare's requirements, which provided a blueprint for other states to do so.
  Since then, Illinois, Vermont and Maryland have adopted their own contraceptive equity laws. Maryland's is among the most expansive; beginning in 2018, all forms of birth control -- including vasectomies and Plan B, the so-called morning-after pill -- will be free for those with insurance.
  ''The thought of losing the federal protections was in the back of our minds,'' said Delegate Ariana B. Kelly, who sponsored the Maryland measure. It passed the Democratic-controlled legislature with bipartisan support, and was signed into law last year by Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, who boasted that Maryland would have ''the most comprehensive coverage for contraception in the country.''
  Women's health advocates credit Obamacare's birth control provisions with helping to reduce rates of teenage pregnancy and abortion, especially among poor women.
  In an interview earlier this year, Dr. Raegan McDonald-Mosley, the chief medical officer for Planned Parenthood, said that shortly after Mr. Trump was elected, the organization had experienced a ''huge surge in demand'' for intrauterine devices and other birth control implants, covered without co-pays under the Affordable Care Act.
  ''Prior to the A.C.A., those methods were not accessible; they were very expensive due to deductibles and co-pays,'' Dr. McDonald-Mosley said.
  As reproductive rights advocates seek to enshrine the federal mandate in state law, they have in some cases run into opposition from the insurance industry as well as religious conservatives.
  Lora M. Pellegrini, president of the Massachusetts Association of Health Plans, an industry trade group, said the bill pending in that state's legislature ''was cloaked as protecting coverage that was part of the Affordable Care Act,'' but instead ''covers everything under the sun.'' Her group is fighting the measure, arguing that it will raise premiums.
  In Nevada, existing law allowed employers to exclude birth control pills and devices if they opposed treatment on religious grounds. But an early version of the measure Governor Sandoval signed removed the religious exemption, and also mandated coverage of the drug mifepristone, known as RU-486, which can induce abortion when combined with another medication.
  That drew opposition from anti-abortion advocates, as well as some Republicans like State Senator Joseph Hardy, who complained that the bills as originally written would create ''an unfettered right to have an abortion.'' Mr. Hardy said the legislature considered four separate birth control measures, and spent so much time debating the issue that one of his colleagues complained of ''contraceptive fatigue bills.''
  Eventually, the religious exemption was restored, and the language regarding RU-486 was stripped out -- a compromise that allowed both sides to claim victory.
  ''We kind of saw the writing on the wall, with Trump,'' said Caroline Mello Roberson, the Nevada state director for Naral Pro-Choice America, an abortion rights group that organized the lobbying effort. ''The message we want to send is that women are here to fight back, and states are leading the resistance.''
