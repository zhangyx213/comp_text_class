FEELING THEIR PAIN
Getting those first immunizations is among the most painful aspects of early childhood -- even for parents, who invariably wince at the cries of their children.
In a novel study, researchers at The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Canada, say they've discovered that the sequence of required shots can actually reduce the pain.
Infants who receive their combined vaccine for diphtheria, polio, tetanus, pertussis and Haemophilus influenzae type B first, followed by the pneumococcal conjugate (PCV) injection appear to experience less pain than those immunized in the opposite order.
Generally speaking, the combined DPTaP-Hib vaccine is less painful. Giving the more painful PCV shot first, the researchers surmised, may focus the infant's attention on the procedure and activate the brain's pain processing centers, resulting in a more intense pain signal to any subsequent shots.
"Varying the order of vaccine administration to reduce pain is a strategy that is simple and effective, cost-free and easily incorporated into clinical practice," said the researchers.
Plus, it helps ensure the children and parents will return for the next set of scheduled shots.
GET ME THAT. STAT!
Women who have babies naturally in their 40s and 50s tend to live longer than other women, says a new study by University of Utah demographers. Specifically, the study found that women who gave birth at age 45 or older were 14 percent to 17 percent less likely to die during any year after age 50 than women who did not deliver a child after age 40.
NUMBER CRUNCHER
A single cake doughnut -- chocolate, sugared or glazed -- (about 3 3/4 inches in diameter or 60 grams) contains 175 calories, 75 from fat. It has 8.4 grams of total fat or 13 percent of the recommended total fat intake for a 2,000-calorie daily diet.
It also contains 24 milligrams of cholesterol (8 percent); 143 mg of sodium (6 percent); 24.1 grams of total carbohydrates (8 percent); 0.9 g of dietary fiber (4 percent); 13.4 g of sugar and 1.9 g of protein.

HYPOCHONDRIAC'S GUIDE
In Japan (but apparently only in Japan), researchers have identified a psychiatric illness called taijin kyofusho, which involves an intense fear that a person's body is offensive in appearance, movement or odor. The sufferer sometimes believes that his or her body can be shrunk by the power of other people looking at it.
