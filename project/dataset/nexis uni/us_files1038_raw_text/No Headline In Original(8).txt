Sever Toretti, 83, assistant football coach at Penn State in 1949-63, Sunday in State College. He was also an assistant athletic director in charge of recruiting for 16 years after leaving the team. Mr. Toretti is credited with helping recruit the likes of Greg Buttle, John Cappelletti, Lydell Mitchell, Franco Harris, Jack Ham, Mike Reid and Dave Joyner. "Tor was instrumental in the growth of Penn State football during his days as a member of the coaching staff and later in his capacity as a recruiter without peer," athletic director Tim Curley said.

After 10 states passed laws last year mandating that insurers provide some sort of coverage for contraceptives, some Pennsylvania lawmakers are pushing for similar action here.
Sen. Allyson Y. Schwartz, D-Philadelphia, introduced a bill in September that would require health plans that offer prescription coverage to cover five FDA-approved prescription contraceptives: birth control pills; Depo Provera, an injectible contraceptive; Norplant, which is implanted in a woman's arm; diaphragms and IUDs.
Two Montgomery County legislators, Republican Lita Cohen and Democrat Connie Williams, have introduced comparable bills.
Proponents say the legislation rightly forces insurers to pay more attention to an important women's health issue. But the state's insurance industry opposes the bills, citing increased costs. And Catholic organizations are lining up against the issue on religious grounds.
Schwartz's bill is pending before the Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council, which is reviewing the financial impact of the bills. If costs become too high, some employers might drop prescription coverage or even health benefits altogether.
"Every time you add a mandated benefit, you're increasing the costs for everybody and you're limiting choice," said Hollie Fry, spokeswoman for Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield.
The recent actions of other state legislatures have been viewed as "side-effects" of Viagra, the wonder-drug for impotence approved by the FDA in 1998.
Maryland passed a law mandating comprehensive coverage in 1998, and was followed last year by California, Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Maine, Georgia, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Vermont.
Now 18 states have some sort of mandated coverage, although the depth of coverage varies dramatically.
Virginia, for example, passed a law in 1997 that requires insurers only to offer contraceptive coverage, leaving the decision about buying it to employers.
Most health plans provide limited coverage of Viagra, which costs about $ 10 a pill.
"Viagra definitely points out a clear inequity and I think that motivates people do something about it," said Leslie Anastasio, executive director of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League of Pennsylvania. "I think insurance companies should be covering Viagra and I think they should be covering birth control."
Dr. Mitchell Creinin, director of family planning in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Pittsburgh, said the lack of contraceptive coverage is indefensible. In many cases, insurers cover abortion, he said, as well as vasectomies and tubal ligation, but not contraception.
"We allow our insurance companies to be biased against women," he said. "If men were the ones who got pregnant, you know it would be different."
But John Doubman, spokesman for the Insurance Federation of Pennsylvania, said insurers are happy to offer coverage, but employers can't always afford it.
"The cumulative weight of mandated benefits is one of the biggest problems in restraining the cost of health care," Doubman said. "This is just one cost that this system ought not to be made to bear."
How much would mandated coverage cost?
Highmark estimates the cost at $ 213.8 million in increased claims expenses annually for Blue Cross/ Blue Shield subscribers in the state. That comes to $ 94.02 per person per year, said Fry of Highmark.
Those figures differ sharply from those of the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a New York group that supports mandated coverage for contraceptives. Guttmacher calculates the annual increase per health plan member at $ 21.40.
The Pennsylvania cost containment council will sort out the discrepancy, as well as review whether increased access to birth control will reduce the costs of unplanned pregnancies, which result in either abortions or births.
Once it has analyzed all comments and financial information relating to Schwartz's bill, the council will recommend whether it should be approved or needs further study.
Schwartz's bill would only affect health plans regulated by the state, those offered by employers who pay insurance companies to carry the risk for employee claims. About half of all companies in Pennsylvania provide health benefits through self-insured plans, meaning the companies themselves are at financial risk for their employees' claims. These plans are regulated by the federal government.
David Lagnese, a consultant in the Pittsburgh office of Towers Perrin, said that fewer than 10 percent of the large employer self-funded plans that the consulting firm works with cover birth control.
For current employees, the average yearly cost of a prescription drug benefit is about $ 600, Lagnese said. Adding contraceptive coverage would result in a 6 percent annual increase in these costs, or $ 36.
But that would be added to the 16 to 20 percent increase in drug plan costs each year. "That's the sensitivity for the employer. It just can't be looked at in the context of what's the cost of this particular group of drugs."
Insurers say one reason they treat contraceptives differently than other drugs is that some employers, such as some faith-based institutions, oppose the coverage.
The Pennsylvania Catholic Health Association and the Pennsylvania Catholic Conference sent testimony to the cost containment council in December saying that Schwartz's bill would mandate coverage for services that are contrary to church teaching. The organizations said the bill would provide coverage for the so-called "morning after" pill as well as traditional birth control devices, all of which places "a significant burden" on the church's religious freedom.
Democrats say, however, the legislation isn't intended to mandate coverage for the morning-after pill.
WHAT'S COVERED NOW
Bills pending in the Legislature would require health plans that offer prescription coverage to cover the cost of birth control pills; Depo Provera, an injectible contraceptive; Norplant, which is implanted in a woman's arm; diaphragms; and intrauterine devices.
Here's what the region's major insurers cover now:
HealthAmerica covers all the contraceptives listed in Schwartz's bill except Norplant as part of its standard pharmacy benefit, but it gives employers the option to buy a rider that excludes contraceptive coverage.
Highmark offers a number of prescription drug plans, but its managed care plans generally cover oral contraceptives and Depo Provera. Employer groups are given the option to exclude and/or require preauthorization of oral and injectible contraceptives.
Aetna U.S. Healthcare gives employers the option of buying a rider that includes all five of the contraceptives that would be mandated by Schwartz's bill.
All three companies cover oral contraceptives to treat medical conditions. For example, some women at the onset of menopause receive birth control pills to stem unusually heavy bleeding.
