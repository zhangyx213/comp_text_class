The annual orgy of college hoops that is the NCAA basketball tournament will culminate next weekend in the Final Four.
By then, some men will have spent three weeks communing with their brackets. That's not difficult for single guys. But men with wives and families have to work a little harder to get that much uninterrupted TV time. Fortunately, a hardy band of entrepreneurs will help arrange it. TiVo salesmen? No. Urologists.
American Medical News reports a new marketing trend among doctors who perform vasectomies: Encouraging men to schedule procedures during the tournament so that the patients can maximize their TV time while recuperating. Some clinics reportedly are giving away "recovery kits" that include pizza coupons and sports magazines.
That strikes us as a bit, uh, extreme. But the St. Paul Pioneer Press interviewed one patient who spent last weekend in video-assisted recovery. "Why not?" the 35-year-old man reportedly asked.
Well, there is that little matter of the snippy surgical prelude.
It's not too late for sports fans who missed making an appointment to coincide with this year's tournament. The newspaper reports that the same thing takes place during the Masters golf tournament in April.
