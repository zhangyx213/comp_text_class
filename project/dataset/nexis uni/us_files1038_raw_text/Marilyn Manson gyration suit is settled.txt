A security guard has dropped his sexual-assault suit against shock rocker Marilyn Manson after the two sides reached an undisclosed settlement. Joshua Keasler claims that during a July 2001 performance in Detroit, Manson wrapped his legs around Keasler's neck and gyrated against him while wearing only a leather thong and panty hose. Ouch!
Keasler had sued Manson in U.S. District Court in Detroit for sexual assault and intentional infliction of emotional distress. "I can now go on with my life and try to close this unhappy chapter," he said.
Manson's attorney could not be reached for comment.
Not above the law
* A former business partner of the environment-loving, kick-boxing thesp Steven Seagal has been sentenced to a year and a day in prison after admitting he plotted to have the mob shake down the action star.
Julius Nasso, a producer of early Seagal films, also will pay a $75,000 fine and receive mental-health counseling after his release from prison. He pleaded guilty to extortion conspiracy in federal court in August.
Prosecutors said the plea agreement took into account Nasso's law-abiding past and a history of depression and anxiety that affected his mental stability. Yeah, we always turn to the mob when we feel blue.
Spielberg does good, again
* Steven Spielberg has given $40,000 through the Shoah Foundation to an exhibit about the Jewish ghetto in Krakow, Poland, that is scheduled to open this summer.
The exhibit in the former "Under the Eagle" pharmacy, in the heart of the district where the Nazis forced 17,000 Jews to live from 1941 to 1943, will document the history of the ghetto, said city councilor Boguslaw Sonik.
"I received a phone call from the Spielberg foundation that they have cleared all the bureaucratic hurdles and that the money is coming through," Sonik said.
O'Brien: C'est mon bad
* Thank heavens! It looks as if Canada will not launch an invasion of our nation any time soon. That's because Conan O'Brien has apologized for a horrendously funny anti-Canadian skit on NBC's Late Night Thursday in which the puppet Triumph the Insult Comic Dog mocked Quebec's French-speaking populace.
During his monologue on Tuesday night's show, O'Brien issued a bilingual, self-deprecating mea culpa. "People of Quebec, I'm sorry," the redheaded comic said, which a translator rendered in French as "People of Quebec, I'm an albino jackass." O'Brien added, "We meant no harm with our comedy piece the other night," which was "translated" as "The other night, I wet the bed like a little girl." Mon dieu!
State of the union
* The love lives of various members of the first family have been making the tabloids lately. Last weekend we reported that Barbara Bush, twin child of the leader of the free world, had been spied in a cozy embrace with the hot Ecuadoran millionaire heir Fabian Basabe at a post-fashion show club party in Gotham. But the New York Post reports the toyboy is not dating the first daughter. They're just pals. The tab does add that he is a totally awesome dancer.
Over on the other side of the family, the tab says Neil Bush will no longer breed. The first brother has gotten a vasectomy in preparation for his March 6 nuptials to Maria Andrews in Houston. The Post speculates that he might have been better off getting it done even sooner: He's waiting for results of a DNA test ordered by the judge presiding in his very nasty divorce from Sharon.
The test is to determine whether Neil fathered Andrews' 3-year-old son, allegedly while he was married to Sharon and Andrews was wed to her ex, Robert. The latter is not a happy camper in all this. In September he filed a defamation lawsuit against Sharon for her claim that Neil fathered the child. Got it?
The measure of a man
* Some readers may be pleased to learn that a full-color director's cut of mimbo-cum-video-auteur Rick Salomon's 37-minute opus - the one starring America's sweetheart Paris Hilton - is now available for download at $50. And its creator, who cried foul when he was accused of leaking the original green-tinted night-vision clip back in November, is out on the campaign stump not only not denying he had a hand in the video's latest resurrection, but actually crowing about his achievement.
Not missing a beat, he tells the New York Daily News that 50,000 folks a day have been downloading the movie. "I had tons of shame from this whole thing," he said. "Now, I'm . . . at least making some money off of it." He says he expects to net as much as $100 mil.
Norah scores big
* Norah Jones has kicked serious music-chart behind. The girlie-faced yet sultry vocalist's second CD, Feels Like Home, has sold more than a million in its first week, the highest sales debut since powder-puff group 'N Sync sold 1.9 million copies of Celebrity in 2001. According to Nielsen SoundScan, Jones' follow-up to her Grammy-winning debut, Come Away With Me, sold 1,022,149 copies.
Blowing his own horn a bit, Bruce Lundvall, head of Jones' record label, Blue Note Records, said, "This is the kind of achievement that one can only expect from a truly original, extraordinary artist like Norah."
Dylan tix on sale
* Bob Dylan, our foremost poet-troubadour, will bring his trademark twang to the Tower Theater March 29. Tickets cost $39.50 and $49.50 and go on sale at 10 a.m. Saturday. Information: 215-336-2000 or 856-338- 9000.
