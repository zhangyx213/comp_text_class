They call him Flash, a young Casanova known for his romantic conquests in Detroit.
But because animal love at the Central Park zoo is a tricky thing, the macaque Romeo is meeting Manhattan's seven middle-age lady monkeys like any other new guy in a tough town.
Very carefully.
"If they really decide they don't want him, all seven will gang up on him and do him in," said Don Moore, the Central Park Wildlife Center's animal curator.
As the start of animal mating season nears - not coincidentally, arriving with Valentine's Day - Moore and his staff have become critter Cupids, playing mood music for lovelorn toads and scattering come-hither twigs to arouse the puffins.
"Pretty much our whole focus is getting animals to have sex," Moore said.
Humans are so fascinated with the mating habits of their remote biological relatives that the Wildlife Conservation Society throws an annual adults-only night - on Feb. 12 this year - to examine animal courtship.
Donna Fernandes, a biologist from Boston, boasts one of the best "animal porn" picture collections - copulating insects are her specialty - and a knack for using animal lust to explain bad human behavior.
"Men!" she said. "It pays men to be promiscuous. When the wife reaches menopause, they trade Ivana for a newer model."
Look no further than the tortoise tank, where two old rogues cornered the lone female, their grunts and moans rumbling through the tropical exhibit.
Gus the polar bear may have had a vasectomy, but it didn't keep him from cuddling Ida and Lily. The males, it seems, don't need many incentives.
Oh, but the ladies …
When the timing's right next month, the zookeepers will toss about 2,000 stones on the penguin beach, an animal aphrodisiac akin to chocolates and a Cartier diamond.
The paradise tanagers are aroused by sheep's wool and grapevines; a little rain forest mist melts the cold python heart.
But not everyone gets lucky.
The two Rodriguez fruit bats hanging out in the tropical garden? Both guys. Scooter, Seaweed and April the sea lions are all girls.
"It's kind of like a convent," Moore said.
Tickets for "Jungle Love," the sex talk at the Central Park Wildlife Center at 64th St. and Fifth Ave., are $35 and available by calling (212) 439-6583. Fernandes guarantees tropical drinks following her lecture.
She's also planning games, such as matching photos of various male appendages to the correct animal. "It's a fun date experience," she said.Graphic: Central Park Zookeepers' Guide to the Birds & the Bees
