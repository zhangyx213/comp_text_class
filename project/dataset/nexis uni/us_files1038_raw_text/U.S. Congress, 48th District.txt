Why I'm Running: "The purpose of my candidacy is to expand upon my service to the nation and community.  I will apply ethics of leadership ingrained upon me throughout my life and perfected by the U.S. Marine Corps.  Leadership is nothing more -- or less -- than representation of those you serve.  I will serve the people as they've never been served before."

Occupation: Mortgage broker
Residence: Dana Point
Career: Mortgage broker and director, nonprofit alcohol and drug education workshops Education: B.A in management, M.A. in organizational management, University of Phoenix
Why I'm Running: "A promise made should be a promise kept.  Time after time government is tied to bureaucracy and special interest groups and the taxpayer loses benefits and their rights.  Social security and veteran benefits are two major concerns that I will address as your congressional candidate.  I believe in efficient and effective government.  Vote for Maguire,
I want a prescription Medicare drug benefit for seniors."

Why I'm Running: "I bring more direct experience and knowledge of how Washington, D.C., really works than anyone else.  The ineffective "war on drugs" fosters organized crime and government corruption.  The income tax must go!  IRS spies on everyone's personal life.  Clinton's moralistic foreignpolicy is inviting terrorists to attack us with poison gas and germs."

of politics to transform it from its present tarnished state into something
worthy of governing the nation. 'Only a new seed will yield a new crop.' TheNatural Law Party offers new knowledge: prevention-oriented scientifically proven and field-tested solutions, as well as conflict-free all-party
government."

Why I'm Running: "Today, both major political parties have become parties ofelitists.  The Republicans are funded by big developers, and the Democrats are funded by the teachers' unions and the Hollywood crowd.  We need to restore honesty and integrity to government.  That is why I joined the ReformParty and that is why I am running for Congress."

Why I'm Running: "The people have grown tired and cynical of a system that is unapproachable, uncaring and untrustworthy.

which our nation was built."

education and opportunities in the world."

Why I'm Running: "This election is about trust.  It's a decision about who you can trust to stand up for conservative values, and who we can't trust and depend on.

I would use the same approach and friendly smile he used so effectively, one also exemplified by my cousins earlier in the Congress, Stew and Morris Udall.  As a well-educated physician with vast experience, I offer a broader dimension, spelled out in my Web site, donudallforcongress.com., on issues not considered by others."
