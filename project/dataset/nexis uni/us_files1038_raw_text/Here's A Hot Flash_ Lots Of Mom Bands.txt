Do you moms out there think you're getting too long in the tooth to rock your rolls? Too busy keeping up with kids and bills and your job and the lawn?
Then you are missing the latest craze.
I was introduced to it through a recent "Inside Edition," which featured a story on the hottest bar band playing the Detroit area, The Mydols. How well they rock was not revealed — you only heard a snippet of music — but the band has become famous because all of its members are fortysomething moms.
I thought this must be an anomaly, until research proved it's part of a trend.
Moms are rocking all over.
In Dallas, all-mom band The Frumps plays songs such as "Vasectomy" and a punk version of the Marlo Thomas song from the 1970s, "Mommies Are People." In Westchester County, N.Y., Housewives on Prozac have recorded two albums. One of the band's featured songs is "Eat Your Damn Spaghetti." San Francisco's Placenta writes songs about deadbeat dads.
In May, a three-day festival called Mamapalooza in New York featured music, art and books by moms. How cool is that?
It occurs to me that dads might think along the same lines. In fact, I already have a few songs in mind for my proposed dad band:
* "Your Car Seat Science Confuses Me"
* "Welcome Home, Honey. Here's the Kid"
* "Please Please Please Not a Minivan"
* "Livin' in Fear (of the Tweener Years)"
* "SpaghettiOs With Meatballs: Not Bad"
I figure we throw in a cover of "Papa's Got a Brand New Bag" and a Big Bad Voodoo Daddy tune and we're cool.
Now, all I need to find is a dad who can play guitar. And one who can play drums. And bass. Obviously, I have quite a long way to go here.
THE HORROR: The Tampa Bay area film community, which seems to excel in making horror films, is offering yet another event to creep you out. "The Halloween Horror Picture Show" is set to begin at 5 p.m. Oct. 30 at the University of South Florida's Cooper Hall, Room 103.
Among the films are a Chilean movie, "Eternal Blood," and a European film, "London Voodoo." The event will be hosted by horror film star Necro Nancy, and Professor Paul Bearer of Channel 44's "Creature Feature" will make an appearance.
The event is being sponsored by local film production companies Enigma Films and Metropol Productions.
