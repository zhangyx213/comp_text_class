Body


The first murder on "The Bridge" literally straddles America's border with Mexico. But this frustrating new drama from FX is a child of Denmark and Sweden.
Like AMC's "The Killing," made from "Forbrydelsen" by "Cold Case" showrunner Veena Sud, "The Bridge" is based on a Scandinavian series, with mismatched male and female cops working the same case all season.
"Cold Case" creator Meredith Stiehm places the action along the line separating Ciudad Juarez from El Paso, Texas.
A judge's body was found on the Bridge of the Americas, and our two detectives, both played by Oscar nominees, clash right away. It's the first in a series of terse, cinematic encounters that echo the Danish series shot by shot.
German actress Diane Kruger is Sonya Cross, the El Paso detective who fulfills the difficult genius slot. The pragmatic, affable part of the formula is Marco Ruiz of the Chihuahua State Police, which is a scarier outfit than it sounds like.
Ms. Kruger's star-making role was in "Inglourious Basterds," where badly executed accents are a recurring theme, but she never manages to sound quite American in "The Bridge." She answers the phone "Alpasa Homicide."
As the case gets weirder -- turns out the body was actually that of two people -- Ruiz and Sonya have to work together, and we learn that Ruiz has just had a vasectomy and that Sonya is really, really bad at being nice to people.
Ted Levine, fresh off his tenure baby-sitting an obsessive-compulsive detective on "Monk," appears as the lieutenant who gets to smooth things over for Sonya. She has Asperger's and lives for the job, like other female cops we love.
But unlike Deb on "Dexter," Sonya has zero empathy for victims, and she'd never defy the rules like Linden on "The Killing."
Despite this subtle genius, the killer pretty much embarrasses law enforcement in the first three episodes. Until Sonya starts figuring stuff out, her Asperger's just renders her a humorless, rigid tattletale.
She's looking for the kind of spree killer who exists almost exclusively in our imaginations, plotting elaborate murders for years and always one step ahead.
Helping the killer taunt the police is reporter Daniel Frye (Matthew Lillard doing his twitchy thing). After the killer steals his car and starts calling him, the show spends some time at the least realistic small-screen newspaper since "Charmed." In real life, nobody says "cub reporter," and none have been hired in the past five years, anyway.
Naturally, Frye lacks ethics or humility but has angry sources and a tequila hangover. Mr. Lillard provides some much-needed levity, but Frye is obviously not long for this world.
Elsewhere, Charlotte (Annabeth Gish), who first appeared with the ambulance on the bridge, is the center of another side story that involves some unfortunate appearances by Lyle Lovett as a slimy lawyer.
"The Bridge" will no doubt tie all these threads together in 13 well-executed episodes, after a lot of red herrings, victims killed in horrific ways and one final twist. It's guaranteed to be a depressing journey, and it's starting to feel like one we've been on before.
