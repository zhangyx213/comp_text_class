To the Editor:
Re ''On Abortion, Let's Talk About Men,'' by Michelle Oberman and W. David Ball (Op-Ed, June 3): 
  Bingo and amen! I have been thinking about this and talking about this and yelling at the TV about this for years. In the long and now more heated debate about abortion, men get off scot-free. Men are equally responsible for every abortion, full stop. But in this country, still predominantly run by old white men, anti-abortionists believe that women are vessels who lose their personhood once they are carrying a fetus. The creation begot of the man's sperm has greater value than the woman he impregnated.
  We need not only to talk about men in the abortion debate, but also to hold them accountable. It's not that hard to prevent pregnancies; you just have to care to make the effort, and sharing in the consequences might help.
  Or how about mandatory vasectomies for all pubescent boys? Problem solved. They can bank their sperm and in the future when they're in a relationship with a women who wants to have their child she can voluntarily be inseminated.
  Am I being facetious? Perhaps. But yes, let's talk about boys and men. Can't have unplanned pregnancies without 'em.

  To the Editor:
  We should applaud the argument for men to take equal responsibility for their not-yet-born children, though such equality between men and women leads to a conclusion that many women would reject.
  Most women choose abortion because they are not ready for the obligations that parenthood entails. A man should be given the same right. Currently, a man carries the legal burden of the welfare of any child that is his, whether he wanted the child or not.
  But conception is a mutual act. If it's true equality that the authors are advocating, then a man should be excused from obligations to any child he does not want. And to the mother who has the child against his wishes.
