To the Editor:
Re “” (front page, June 2):
How ironic that President Trump thinks he is “coming to the rescue of the Little Sisters of the Poor,” a religious order that has refused to cover contraception, with his proposed rule to undermine contraceptive coverage under the Affordable Care Act.
The Trump administration may absurdly question the causal link between contraception and unintended pregnancy, but no one can challenge the causal link between unintended pregnancy and poverty. Right now nearly half of pregnancies in the United States are unintended, and the majority of those pregnancies involve families on Medicaid living near or below the poverty line.
Contraception is only partly a personal health issue; more important, it is a critical public health issue. These unintended pregnancies become the responsibility of all of us. Substantial government services exist to support these pregnant mothers and struggling families.
Like access to education, access to contraception is a key ingredient for opportunity and success, and it is essential to closing the gap between rich and poor. The American people should embrace it.

To the Editor:
The other day I provided family planning services to a young mother. Both of her children were born by cesarean section. The second of these surgeries was complex and life-threatening, and the delivering obstetrician advised her never to get pregnant again, as she may not survive the delivery.
Another recent patient told me the story of her third pregnancy, in which a condition called pre-eclampsia caused her to have grand mal seizures during the delivery. She and the infants (twins) almost died in the process. One remains severely handicapped.
What government or employer has the right to decide whether or how these women — or any woman — should prevent future pregnancies? The fates of their lives and bodies are not subjects for anyone else’s “conscientious objections.”

To the Editor:
Have I missed it, or doesn’t anyone talk about the potential savings for eliminating vasectomies in faith-based health coverage? I am against such exceptions, but if they are to be there, why aren’t we talking about coverage for Viagra and vasectomies, as opposed to only coverage that affects women’s choices?
