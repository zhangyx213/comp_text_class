As a woman, my view on the abortion issue is this: Let us turn the tables.
All men should be required to have a vasectomy, a minor outpatient operation that can be reversed later in life. This would end the problem of unwanted pregnancies, including in cases of incest and rape.
That would solve the whole issue. Problem solved.
