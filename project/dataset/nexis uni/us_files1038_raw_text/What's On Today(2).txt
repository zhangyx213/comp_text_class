10 P.M. (Discovery) LIFE ON A WIRE Nik Wallenda, above, a seventh-generation member of the acrobatic family the Flying Wallendas, is on a mission to take his high-wire act to a new audience. In this sneak peek of a series that will have its premiere later this year, Mr. Wallenda, 32, demonstrates how he routinely cheats death as he balances on a wire without a safety net, through the use of engineering and wind-speed analysis conducted by a crew that includes his uncle Mike and his father, Terry. His feat here: to try to break two world records by crossing a wire between towers at the Atlantis resort in the Bahamas. On June 4 he and his mother, Delilah, successfully completed a walk at the Condado Plaza Hotel in San Juan, P.R., on a wire stretched 121 feet above the pavement -- the crossing that killed his great-grandfather Karl in 1978. Mr. Wallenda eventually plans to honor Karl Wallenda's memory by walking across the Grand Canyon.
