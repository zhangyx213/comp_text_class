HAS ANYONE ever wondered why a large number of people who write letters protesting abortion are MEN?
Why is it men who are bombing clinics or threatening to kill doctors who perform abortions? Is it a threat to their mortality? An ego thing? And don't tell me it is the Christian way!
Personally, I'm against abortion. I feel it should only be done in certain circumstances. But, I'm not God, and I don't have the right to judge anyone.
Women have rights and I'm tired of these self-righteous men telling us how immoral we are! Even some pharmacists have jumped on the bandwagon by refusing to fill prescriptions for birth-control pills because of their religious beliefs.
Our government officials are even trying to play the religion card. What a joke! They need to look inward, at themselves, before they get up on the pulpit and preach to the multitudes.
Have any of these men thought about vasectomies? If a man wants a vasectomy, he can have it done and no one has to know about it. But isn't he doing the same thing, killing all those little cells that could produce a human life?
Letter-writer Patrick Stanton said it himself: Science has proved that the fertilized egg is a human life. But which cell produces life? The man's or the woman's? So, being a self-appointed keeper of life, why haven't you protested vasectomies?
Why don't you stand outside a urologist's office and ask the men coming out if they've had a vasectomy? Or why don't you just assume that all men going to a urologist are there to have a vasectomy, just like they do with Planned Parenthood clinics. You assume that all women, going into a woman's clinic, are having abortions.
A cell is a cell until nature decides what form it will take. Until then it is just a cell.
It doesn't have a brain or a heart, and it can't live outside the human body. I learned this in high school biology. Where were you, Mr. Stanton, when they taught this in biology class? In church, learning to be a good Christian?
