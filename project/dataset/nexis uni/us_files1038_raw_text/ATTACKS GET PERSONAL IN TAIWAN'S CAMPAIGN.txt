For people who enjoy soap operas, mud wrestling, or political sex scandals, Taiwan's presidential election is a race worth watching.
One leading candidate, Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party, officially opened his campaign headquarters recently with a preemptive vasectomy defense.
His political foes, Chen warned supporters, would soon allege that he had fathered an illegitimate son in Singapore. But surgery had made him incapable of such an act, Chen said. He even lacked the opportunity, he said, because during his trips to Singapore he was accompanied by security agents - and his wife.
"When would I have time to meet my girlfriend?" the indignant candidate asked.
Although next Saturday's election has serious implications for Taiwan, China and the United States, the campaign's pungent personal politics is grabbing lots of attention. That is largely because the positions of the three leading candidates on the big issues are almost indistinguishable.
They agree on relations with China (should be better while preserving Taiwan's independence), economic development (more is better), and public corruption (more should be done to curb it).
This leaves the trio, who are running nearly even, with little more than personal attacks to hurl. And they are filling the air with them.
Chen, for example, also used the occasion of his headquarters opening to deny a forthcoming allegation of financial impropriety. Sure enough, lawmaker Lin Jiu-tu accused Chen the next day of defrauding a Malaysian tycoon out of $6.7 million while Chen was mayor of Taipei.
That same day, a newspaper reported that opponents intended to release a book before the election alleging that Chen had suspiciously amassed great wealth while mayor from 1994 to 1998. They charge that Chen hid the assets illegally in the names of his wife and children.
"Chen has been deceiving the public by creating a false image that he is one of the common people, but our book will reveal his true identity," coauthor Lee Ching-yuan said.
The accusations have not helped Chen's image as a squeaky-clean crime fighter. The timing could not have been better for his rival James Soong, staggered by his own financial scandal.
Soong, former provincial governor of Taiwan, had been regarded until December as the clear front-runner. Then the ruling Kuomintang Party, from which Soong defected to run for president, accused him of diverting $7.6 million from a party slush fund to the bank accounts of his son and sister-in-law.
The candidate said that President Lee Teng-hui approved the transfers and that the money was meant for the family of former Taiwanese President Chiang Ching-kuo. Both Lee and the Chiang family contradicted that account, however, and Soong's standing among voters plummeted.
The fresh allegations against Chen gave Soong something new: a diarrhea defense.
"James Soong may be a bad apple, but James Soong will only give you diarrhea," said Soong's spokesman, Changhai Shaw. "The other two are poison apples - they will make you dead. If you have three bad apples, should you pick the one that hurts you most?"
The third apple is Vice President Lien Chan, standard-bearer of the Kuomintang, or KMT, which has ruled Taiwan since Chinese Nationalist forces fled to the island after their defeat by China's Communists in 1949.
The KMT, with at least $4 billion in assets ranging from real estate to petrochemical companies, may be the world's richest political party. And the KMT - termed a "mafiacracy" by some Taiwan analysts - has freely used its deep pockets to buy votes, subsidize allies, and otherwise ensure its longevity.
In an attempt to disassociate himself from the corrupt politics of the KMT, Lien recently promised that the party would stop actively managing the more than 100 companies in which it owns shares and put its investments in a trust.
Lien's gains from that gesture were offset soon afterward when a SWAT team led by a judge stormed the house of a lawmaker who supported Soong.
The assault ostensibly was to collect evidence in a business corruption probe. But the target of the raid, Liu Sung-fan, called it "political persecution" by the KMT for his backing of Soong.
Hundreds of voters agreed, gathering outside a courthouse to protest what they said was the KMT's manipulation of the judicial system, and a KMT cabinet member resigned in disgust.
"I could no longer put up with what I've seen," said David Chung, a former minister without portfolio. Some here expect other high-ranking KMT officials to bolt the party soon. That would bode ill for Lien, who lags a bit behind Chen and Soong in some polls and is regarded as the least charismatic of the three.
But few here would bet against the KMT. Polls have indicated that even many voters who support Chen or Soong think the ruling party's candidate will win because of the KMT's huge political machine and unlimited resources.
Not among them, of course, is Soong spokesman Shaw, who predicted the election would mark the end of an era.
"The KMT is in crisis," he said. "It can't control the votes any longer. . . . The people are fed up with gangsterism and money politics."
