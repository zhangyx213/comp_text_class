A mother charged with murder after her newborn baby was found dead near a garbage can outside her home pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter yesterday.
Edith Ledesma, 25, faces a maximum sentence of 11 years in prison when she is set to be sentenced Sept. 26 in Vista Superior Court.
Ledesma, the mother of three other children, had doubted she was pregnant because her boyfriend had undergone a vasectomy, and she did not feel the baby move, Deputy Public Defender Matt Roberts said in an interview.
On May 13, 2006, she went into labor at her home in Vista. She eventually gave birth to a healthy baby boy, but went into shock after losing seven pints of blood, Roberts said.
Confused, she placed the baby outside in a blanket until she could decide what to do, Roberts said.
Ledesma was taken to a hospital and did not tell authorities about the baby for two days.
She feared her boyfriend would not accept the child since he had earlier accused her of being unfaithful, Roberts said. DNA tests determined the boyfriend -- who missed an appointment to confirm that the vasectomy had worked -- fathered the boy, the lawyer said.
Ledesma's three children are being cared for by her parents and her estranged boyfriend, who fathered the children.
