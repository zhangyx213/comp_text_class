Lena Dunham's real reality
Reality ain't always very pretty - or Hollywood perfect. 
That's one of the themes that runs through wunderkind Lena Dunham's HBO show, Girls. 
The sex, she tells Vogue mag, is decidedly unglamorous. 
"There was a sense that I and many women I knew had been led astray by Hollywood and television depictions of sexuality," Lena tells the mag. 
The sex scenes in Girls tend to make you squirm. There's a reason for that, says the writer, actor, producer, and director: "Seeing somebody who looks like you having sex on television is a less comfortable experience than seeing somebody who looks like nobody you've ever met." 
  Song of the week
"I'm stuck in Gov. Chris Christie's Fort Lee, New Jersey traffic jam," Bruce Springsteen and Jimmy Fallon sang on the comic's show in a tune modeled after "Born to Run" that mocked the governor's bridge scandal. Bruce is one of Christie's idols, so it made the snark all the sharper.

Grown Ups 2 received a leading eight noms, including worst actor for Adam Sandler. Other actors so honored include Ashton Kutcher (Jobs), Jaden Smith (After Earth) Selena Gomez (The Getaway), and Naomi Watts (Diana and Movie 43). Winners (losers, really) will be announced March 1. 
  Gosselin, snipped & sniping
Jon Gosselin's inseminating days are over: He tells Wendy Williams he's had a vasectomy. Jon says his gf, Liz Jannetta, who has three kids of her own, also has been "fixed." 
Jon also takes a few snipes at ex-wife and Jon and Kate Plus 8 costar Kate. He claims she keeps their kids isolated at her Berks County house, only taking them out to use as p.r. props. "When they're with me, I let them out into society," Jon tells In Touch Weekly. 
  What a clever move, dude!
Justin Bieber's pal, rapper Lil Za, was arrested a second time Tuesday. Minutes after he was released after being charged with coke possession, he smashed up a jailhouse phone, says TMZ. Police booked him again, this time for vandalism.
