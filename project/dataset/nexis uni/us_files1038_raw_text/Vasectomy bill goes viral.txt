Highlight: Legislator: Parody of abortion measure has serious message.
Body


Rep. Yasmin Neal, a Jonesboro Democrat, was a relatively unknown freshman state representative Tuesday morning. But by Tuesday night, she was featured on left-leaning TV commentator Rachel Maddow's blog, she became a trending topic on Twitter, and CNN called for an interview Wednesday.
"I am floored," she said of her sudden fame.
The blasting cap that set off the explosion of publicity was Neal's House Bill 1116, a parody of the abortion-limiting bill moving quickly through the Georgia House. Neal proposes instead limiting vasectomies for men, except in cases in which not getting one would result in death or "impairment of a major bodily function." There is a hint of sarcasm there, Neal said Wednesday, but parody can make an effective argument, and Neal said she is sending a serious message.
"Consider the feelings of a woman, if only for a moment," when drafting legislation that tells women what kind of medical decisions they can or cannot make, Neal said.
She and supporters in the Legislature are wondering if the abortion bill, which will limit abortions to the first 20 weeks of pregnancy with few exceptions, has political rather than medical ends in sight.
The chief sponsor of House Bill 954, Rep. Doug McKillip of Athens, said late-term abortions are a "barbaric practice."
McKillip was elected as a Democrat and flipped to join the Republicans before the session started. Sen. Nan Orrock, D-Atlanta, thinks the bill is aimed at Election Day.
"This is a red-meat issue that brings out the right-wingers to vote," Orrock said.
McKillip said the vasectomy bill is a distraction from discussing late-term abortions.
"I think [Neal's bill] is a poor attempt at humor," McKillip said. "This is a serious discussion."
Neal said he believes his bill will have a third committee hearing Friday. The committee could send the bill to the House Rules Committee for scheduling for debate of the full House.
