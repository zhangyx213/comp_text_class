Regarding the May 12 letter "No One Can Impose Morality or Beliefs," how very arrogant of the writer. First, the writer says, "Who's going to take care of all the unwanted babies?" My wife and I waited three years to adopt. Believe me, there are plenty of people who would gladly take care of the "unwanted babies." There's no reason to murder "unwanted babies."
Second, the writer states, "But now you want them to have more babies...." No, no one wants them to have more babies that they don't want. Here's a tip: How about not getting pregnant to begin with? Now there's a concept. Because that is the true choice in pro-choice. Choose not to get pregnant if you don't want the baby.
Third, and here's the part that truly astounds me and is the incredibly arrogant part: The writer says, "All single males who believe abortion is not morally and religiously right, thus dictating what women can do with their bodies, should practice abstinence or get vasectomies."
Really? That is the writer's solution? It takes two. How about the female practice abstinence or use birth control (the same birth control the writer clamors to have available free to everyone)? Or is abortion (and hence murder) the writer's grand idea of birth control?
