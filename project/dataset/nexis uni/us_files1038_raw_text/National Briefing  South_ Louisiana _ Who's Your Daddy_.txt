A female chimpanzee at a sanctuary has given birth, despite the fact that the facility's entire male chimp population has had vasectomies. Now managers at the sanctuary, Chimp Haven, are planning a paternity test for the seven males who lived in a group with the female, Teresa, a chimpanzee in her late 40s who had a baby girl last week. Once they identify the father, it is back to the operating room for him. Chimp Haven, about 20 miles southwest of Shreveport, provides long-term care for chimpanzees that are no longer needed for laboratory research.
