Russian aid enters Ukraine accompanied by Red Cross
Russia on Tuesday dispatched hundreds of trucks covered in white tarps and sprinkled with holy water on a mission to deliver aid to a desperate rebel-held zone in Ukraine.
The televised sight of the miles-long convoy sparked a show of indignation from the government in Kiev, which insisted any aid must be delivered by the international Red Cross. Ukraine and the West have openly expressed its concern that Moscow intends to use the cover of a humanitarian operation for a military incursion in support of pro-Russian separatists.
Amid those anxieties, Russian President Vladimir Putin today planned to travel to Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula Russia annexed in March, where he is to preside over a meeting involving the entire Russian Cabinet and most members of the lower house of parliament.
Russian authorities said the trucks were loaded with nearly 2,000 metric tons of cargo from baby food to portable generators.
Group says Egypt authorities likely committed crimes against humanity • A leading international human rights group asserted Tuesday that Egyptian authorities likely committed crimes against humanity in the deaths of hundreds of demonstrators last August, most of them supporters of deposed Islamist president Mohamed Morsi and his Muslim Brotherhood.
Egypt sharply disputed the findings of New York-based Human Rights Watch and barred senior representatives of the organization from entering the country to publicly present their report, which was based on a yearlong investigation.
India's new leader accuses Pakistan of terrorism • India's new leader slammed Pakistan on Tuesday, accusing it of terrorism and saying its U.S.-backed military is too weak to fight a conventional war. The comments by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his first visit to the disputed territory of Jammu and Kashmir were his harshest yet against Pakistan and set back hopes that an upcoming summit could bolster peace efforts between the nuclear-armed neighbors.
Iran bans vasectomies, wants more babies • Men in Iran wanting to get vasectomies will soon be out of luck now that the country's parliament has approved a ban on surgical, permanent forms of birth control. Violators will be punished as having committed a crime, state media reported Sunday.
The bill also bans similar procedures for women but includes an exemption for cases in which the surgery "is urgently needed for health," IRNA reports.
Why pass such legislation? Declining birthrates. IRNA reports that the country's birthrate is 1.8 children per woman, according to Khalil Ali-Mohammadzadeh of Iran's Health and Treatment Commission of Women's Cultural and Social Council. That's below the 2.1 birthrate needed to replace the population as people die.
Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has publicly encouraged young Iranians to have more babies as a way of pushing back on "undesirable aspects of Western lifestyles."
