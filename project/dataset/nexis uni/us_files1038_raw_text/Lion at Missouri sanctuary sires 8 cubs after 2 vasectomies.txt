SADDLEBROOKE, MO. - A Missouri tiger sanctuary is raising eight lion cubs that unexpectedly joined the family after a lion, who had undergone two vasectomies, sired them.
Leo the lion received his first vasectomy in 2015, according to the Springfield News-Leader. Then, late last year, National Tiger Sanctuary in Saddlebrooke staff was surprised to discover that he had fathered two cubs. However, both died from a vitamin A deficiency.
Staff members then gave Leo a second vasectomy, but he somehow managed to sire eight additional cubs this year.
Keepers checking on one lioness on April Fools' Day found her with four cubs. Staff then checked a second lioness for pregnancy, and four more cubs were born a month later.
