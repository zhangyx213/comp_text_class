SERIES PREMIERES
9:00 p.m. (UPN) "Britney and Kevin: Chaotic." I haven't seen this new series yet, in which Britney Spears and Kevin Federline point the cameras at themselves and record their increasingly close relationship. 
Trust me - were it not my job to watch it, I'd be able to say the same thing tomorrow. If ever a show is deserving of a little prejudgment, this is it.
SPECIALS
8:00 p.m. (CBS) "Academy of Country Music Awards." If you don't know Big Kenny and John Rich, aka Big & Rich, here's the place and time to get acquainted. Also performing and/or nominated, in addition to those hot new country stars, are familiar and friendly Reba McEntire, Martina McBride, Toby Keith, Brooks & Dunn and Alison Krauss.
SEASON FINALES
8:00 p.m. (ABC) "My Wife and Kids." For the fifth-season finale, the plot involves one of the unkindest cuts of all: a vasectomy.
8:00 (WB) "The Gilmore Girls." Another fifth-season finale episode, this one continues to figure out how to reconfigure the lives of Rory and Lorelai while still maximizing their mother-daughter contact and relationship.
8:40 (ABC) "The George Lopez Show." Amazingly, this show has lasted four years already. This fourth-season finale features cameos, at least, by Donovan McNabb and Daunte Culpepper - but they may be the only elements worthy of a Super-Size episode.
SERIES
8:00 p.m. (Fox) "American Idol." It's down to the final three, and the performance of one will soon cut the field to two - and
I'm not talking about the judges.
