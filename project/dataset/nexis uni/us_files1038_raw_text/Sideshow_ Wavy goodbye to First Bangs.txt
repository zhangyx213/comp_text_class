The bangs have bung; the sweep is swept. Michelle Obama wowed the world in January, when she debuted her bangs at hub Barack Obama's second presidential inauguration. But that was so five months ago. Lately, the First Female has been calling her bangs "irritating," and Friday, at a commencement at Maryland's Bowie State University, she had a longer, wavy hairstyle, with the grown-out bangs swept to the side. Nice. 
  Beyoncé, fertile!
As in preggers! E!Online was "confirming" Friday, via Multiple Sources, that Beyoncé's long-rumored inhabitation by a small human is indeed a fact. Baby Number Two is on its way to her and husband Jay-Z, E! insists. 
  Boston's director
Andris Nelsons of Latvia has been appointed music director of the 132-year-old Boston Symphony Orchestra. His predecessor, James Levine, cleared out in 2011. At 34, Andris is even younger than geezer Yannick Nézet-Séguin, 38, music dir of the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra. 
  Munich monkey mess
What was Justin Bieber thinking? On March 28, he shooshes into Munich on world tour, bringing along capuchin monkey Mally. No papers, though. So authorities took Mally, stuck her in a shelter, and says Biebs owes the German guvmint thousands of euros. It's a mess. J-Bieb doesn't want Mally back. So? He he still has to pay up. 
  She's got friends
Yay, Carole King! She's the first female woman of the feminine persuasion to get the Gershwin Prize for Popular Song from the Library of Congress. The thing's been around since only 2007. She joins company as good as it can be: Previous winners are Paul Simon, Stevie Wonder, Paul McCartney, and Burt Bacharach/Hal David. Wowzer. President Obama will throw a proper shindy for Ms. King at a Wednesday concert at the Libe. Performers will include Carole herself, Gloria Estefan, Billy Joel, Jesse McCartney, Emeli Sandé, James Taylor, and Trisha Yearwood. 
  Lisa Ling, mommy!
After miscarriages in 2010 and 2011, Lisa Ling, 39, host of Our America with Lisa Ling on Oprah Winfrey's OWN cabler, is happy to announce the March 8 birth of daughter Jett to herself and her M.D. hub Paul Song. "We weren't trying," she says. That's how it works sometimes. Why Jett? "I'm a huge fan of martial arts and Jet Li," Ling tells Us mag, "so I loved the name Jett. It also reminds me of Joan Jett and [expletive] women rockers." 
  Billy Bob, gentleman!
Hats off to Billy Bob Thornton. Video cameras caught him gallantly telling a reporter he wished only the best for his ex, Angelina Jolie, in light of her choice to have a double mastectomy to head off breast cancer. Billy Bob was gallant in another way, ignoring the clearly audible fact that the reporter asked about Angelina's "double vasectomy."
