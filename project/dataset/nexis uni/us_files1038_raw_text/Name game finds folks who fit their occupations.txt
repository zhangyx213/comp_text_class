Dear Abby: Not long ago you wrote a column that mentioned funny names that match people's occupations. I am submitting two more: Prior to our wedding, my husband and I had the state-required blood tests. They were administered by a Dr. Fix. (We later read that Dr. Fix was caught giving himself one, and was arrested on drug charges.) The minister who married us was aptly named Dr. Comfort.
Thanks for a "Fixer"-upper of a letter. It arrived with a bushel of mail from other readers offering names that match occupations. Read on:
Dear Abby: One of my dearest friends is a professional landscaper of golf courses, highways and schools. His name? Ross Weed!
Dear Abby: My husband, last name Graves, is a funeral director.
Dear Abby: The first time I took my grandchildren to their doctor, their regular physician was on vacation. The doctor who was filling in for him was named Dr. Needle. I kid you not.
Dear Abby: When I was in college, the disciplinary dean's name was Dick Justice.
Dear Abby: I have a couple of names that take the cake. I am a nurse in a large hospital in central Wisconsin. We had a plastic surgeon named Dr. Hacker, and if that wasn't enough, his resident was Dr. Wacker. Not surprisingly, their patients required a lot of reassurance. Wouldn't you?
Dear Abby: While I was serving at the Marine Corps Schools in Quantico, Va., my best friend took me with him when he had his vasectomy. His physician's name was Dr. D. Nutter.
Dear Abby: There is a dentist in my city whose hygienist's last name is Toothacher. 
Dear Abby: In Portland, Ore., where I reside, there are three orthodontists: Dr. Payne, Dr. Fear and Dr. Rensch (pronounced "Wrench")!
Dear Abby: I swear this is true: When I visited my first gynecologist when I was in college, his name was Dr. Clapp.
Dear Abby: When I worked at a major hospital, from time to time I would see trauma victims with the attending doctor's name being "Dr. Kill." Initially I thought it was a hospital code for victims who might still be at risk. As it turned out, Dr. Kill is a practicing physician.
