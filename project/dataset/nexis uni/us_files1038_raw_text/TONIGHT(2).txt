SEASON FINALES
8:00 p.m. (Fox) "The Swan." Tonight's the night when all but one of these women - who for months subjected themselves to plastic surgery, weight-loss programs and other image-altering efforts - get to stand there and be told they're still not lovely enough to be awarded anything. 
What a horrific exercise in crushing self-esteem. And yet, when this reality series ends tonight, we haven't seen the last of it. Fox is bringing it back next season.
8:00 (CBS) "Yes, Dear." This is the fourth-season finale of this sitcom with Mike O'Malley (left). Though it's not on the CBS fall schedule, the network has ordered 13 more episodes as a midseason backup.
9:00 (CBS) "Everybody Loves Raymond." In this eighth-season finale, Ray and Robert (Ray Romano, Brad Garrett) stage a contest to determine who will take care of their mother if Frank dies before she does. In this case, it's a good bet that winner doesn't take all.
9:00 (UPN) "Girlfriends." Like "Eve," this UPN comedy ends the season (in this case, its fourth) with an expanded one-hour show.
9:30 (CBS) "Two and a Half Men." In the season finale of the top-rated new comedy, Charlie (Charlie Sheen) contemplates the unkindest cut of all - a vasectomy.
10:00 (CBS) "CSI: Miami." Last week's episode, which set up the "CSI: NY" spinoff, was the highest-rated Monday program all season, including "Monday Night Football" games. That bodes well for the new show - and for tonight's second-season finale of "Miami," itself a spinoff of "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation."David Bianculli
