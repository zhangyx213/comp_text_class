Corrections that appeared in print on Thursday, Sept. 24, 2020.
FRONT PAGE 
  An article on Tuesday about the Portland, Ore., protests moving into suburb neighborhoods referred incorrectly to Jessie Burke, a business owner in Portland. She is a woman.
  A picture caption with an article on Sunday about Paul Rusesabagina, the hero behind the film ''Hotel Rwanda,'' using information from Getty Images, misidentified the location of a refugee camp photographed in 1994. It was in Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of Congo, not Rwanda.
  INTERNATIONAL
  An article on Sunday about a Danish children's television show aimed at countering body shaming misstated medical treatment received by Rei, one of the adults featured on the program. Rei did not have a vasectomy.
  SPORTS
  A headline on a chart with the Keeping Score column on Tuesday about the career of the Los Angeles Angels slugger Albert Pujols described incorrectly the exclusive baseball club his statistics put him. It is the 3,000-600 club -- players who have hit at least 3,000 hits and at least 600 home runs -- not the ''3,000-6,000'' club.
