NEW DELHI, India -- The newborn girl known as India's 1 billionth citizen has had few quiet moments since her birth two months ago.
Aastha Arora is so famous that journalists show up unannounced at her family's cramped, one-bedroom home to see the icon of India's rising population.
With thousands of births every day in India, Indian and U.N. officials decided that the first child born May 11 at New Delhi's Safdarjang Hospital would be the country's symbolic billionth citizen.
That baby turned out to be Aastha.  Since her birth, an additional 3.5 million babies have been born in India.
Today, the National Population Commission -- set up the day Aastha was born -- will meet in New Delhi to discuss how to slow India's population growth.
The group will review the national population policy and promote cooperation among health, environment and educational programs as well as better coordination among states.
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee is heading the commission, which includes chief ministers of India's 31 states and federal territories.
Now second after China in population, India is the only other country in the world with more than 1 billion inhabitants.  India accounts for 16 percent of the world's population.
India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, dismissed Western concerns about growth, often saying that India's strength was its population.
India's family planning program suffered a major setback in the mid-1970s when the government launched a mass sterilization effort.
Across India, sterilization is now regarded as a dirty word.  With half of India's population illiterate, misconceptions about contraception abound.  Most men, government surveys have found, fear that they will become weak after sterilization.
Volunteers find it difficult to persuade men to head to nearby hospitals to undergo a free vasectomy, which takes less than five minutes.  That puts the burden on women to take care of contraception.  With illiteracy higher among women than among men and access to contraceptives difficult, India's population clock continues to tick rapidly.
Experts worry that if India does not check growth, it will overtake China in 45 years to become the most populous country in the world.
In New Delhi's crowded Najafghad neighborhood, Aastha is something of a celebrity.  A narrow, stone-paved lane flanked by open sewers leads to her house.
Compared with millions of other Indian children, Aastha is lucky: A pediatrician from the government hospital where she was born visits every two weeks to monitor her growth and check her mother's health.
Aastha also has brought good luck to her family.  Donors, including the U.N. Population Fund, have contributed $5,000 for her education.
"She doesn't cry much," her mother says.  "She drinks her milk without a fuss. . . . No problems of any kind.  She's a good baby."
