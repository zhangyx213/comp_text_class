Two new books focus on men's health.
*"It's in the Male: Everyone's Guide to Men's Health," (Appladay Press, $ 14.95) provides a consumer's guide to men's health care for all family members.
It's written by Dr. Jon L. Pryor, a urologist, and Stacy Glass, a registered nurse. Both are involved with the Center for Men's Health and Infertility at the University of Minnesota.
When browsing in his local bookstore, Pryor said, he found a whole section on women's health, but only three books on men's health. He believed more needed to be done to educate men and their families.
Most of the book's 158 pages focus on issues below the belt -- from sexual health to circumcision, vasectomies, impotency, penile conditions, prostate cancer and benign conditions.
*"The Black Man's Guide to Good Health," (Hilton Publishing, $ 16.95), an updated version by Dr. James W. Reed, one of the country's leading African American physicians, and Dr. Neil Shulman, who teaches at the Emory University School of Medicine.
A chapter has been added to this guide, first published in 1994, that covers violence as a health issue for young black men.
The opening chapter motivates men to become activists for their own good health.
The book includes personal profiles to illustrate how real people experience and react to disease, such as high blood pressure, heart disease and stroke, cancer, sickle cell disease, kidney disease, AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases.
New from the FDA
*The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved Pepcid Complete, a new version of the Johnson & Johnson-Merck's heartburn medicine Pepcid AC.
The new over-the-counter remedy combines Pepcid AC's acid-controlling famotidine, which works for up to 12 hours, with 800 milligrams of calcium carbonate and 165 milligrams of magnesium, which neutralizes acid.
"Until now, sufferers have had to manage a variety of medicines to relieve their symptoms, choosing speed or duration of relief," said Dr. Scott Korn, a company executive.
*As more people undergo colonoscopies to screen for colon cancer, a new product has been approved by the FDA that can make the procedure a little easier.
Until now, patients had to drink a gallon of a vile-tasting liquid the night before the procedure to clean the bowel. Now come Visicol tablets by InKine Pharmaceuticals, which can be taken to purge the digestive tract before a colonoscopy.
The product is expected to be on the market in January 2001.
A colonoscopy, in which a doctor examines the entire length of the bowel, is used to detect colon cancer, which is the second-leading cause of cancer death in the United States.
New product
Holding sick, squirming children still for 60 or 90 seconds to take their temperature can be difficult.
The new Omron 3-Way Instant Thermometer determines a temperature in 4 to 6 seconds, making it the first nonear thermometer capable of delivering an "instant" reading.
The Omron can be used in either Fahrenheit or Centigrade mode, and can be changed from oral to rectal or underarm readings with the press of a button. It runs on a 9-volt battery. The thermometer will be on store shelves nationwide in November, retailing at $ 49.99. For details, call (800) 634-4350 or visit .
