Workers cited in elevator death
Maintenance workers failed to enable a door safety circuit on an elevator in a Manhattan office tower moments before an advertising executive was killed in December after stepping into it, according to city officials who investigated. If the circuit had been working properly, they said, it would most likely have prevented the elevator from pinning Suzanne Hart inside an elevator shaft.
The Buildings Department is suspending the license of the owner of the maintenance company, Transel Elevator, and will seek to have the license revoked. It says two workers bypassed the door safety circuit with a jumper wire on Dec. 14 Video footage showed the workers leaving the building at 9:55 a.m. At 9:56 a.m., Hart, 41, stepped into the elevator. The car lurched upward, its doors still open, pinning half of her body in the elevator shaft between the first and second floors. She was pronounced dead at the scene. Two other people were trapped in the elevator with her body while rescue workers labored to get them out.

Colorado, Washington offer marijuana vote

Jurors selected in rape case again priests

Supreme Court blocks attempt to fight carp
The U.S. Supreme Court refused Monday to order emergency measures that might prevent Asian carp from reaching the Great Lakes, despite a warning that the exotic fish pose a "dire threat" to the region's environment and economy. Michigan and four neighboring states wanted the Army Corps of Engineers to install nets in two Chicago-area rivers and to expedite a study of permanent steps to head off an invasion by the fish, which have advanced to within 55 miles of Lake Michigan.

Cruise ships turned away in islands dispute
An Argentine province turned away two cruise ships early Monday, seeking leverage against Britain in the country's sovereignty dispute over the Falkland Islands.

Public executions rise in Iran in 2011
Iran put to death more than twice as many people in 2011 as it did the year before, Amnesty International said Monday in a new report. The rights group said that the rate of executions in public increased even more dramatically, in an apparent bid to suppress political dissent.
U.N.: Pirate attacks off Africa's coast rising
The U.N. says pirate attacks off Africa's west coast in the Gulf of Guinea are increasing and becoming more violent, sophisticated and systematic. U.N. political chief B.

Tokyo evacuation weighed after accident
In the darkest moments of last year's nuclear accident, Japanese leaders did not know the actual extent of damage at the plant and secretly considered the possibility of evacuating Tokyo, even as they tried to play down the risks in public, an independent investigation into the accident disclosed on Monday.
