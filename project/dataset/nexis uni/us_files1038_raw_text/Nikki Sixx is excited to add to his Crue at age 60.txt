Nikki Sixx has no qualms about becoming a dad again at 60.
The uninhibited Mötley Crüe bassist revealed this month that he's expecting a baby girl with his wife, Courtney Bingham, 33, who is five months pregnant.
"I figure I'm going to be on an IV drip by the time she's 20," Sixx jokes.
The news came as a surprise to many fans of the '80s rock icon, who  had a vasectomy after  his 2007 divorce from his second wife, actress Donna D'Errico, with whom he shares a teenage daughter. He also has three children with his first wife, Playboy model Brandi Brandt, all of whom are in their 20s.
"I was once married to someone named Satan, and I said, 'I'm not going to live the rest of my life in court fighting over child support, so I don't ever want to do this again,'" Sixx says of his decision to get a vasectomy.
But that changed when he met Bingham, whom he married in 2014.
"I remember thinking: 'I miss those days. I miss being a dad,'" says Sixx, who was raised in San Jose, California, by a single mother and grandparents after his father left the family. "I didn't have a father, and I always loved being a father. It's an itch I can't scratch. My kids are older, and I have a great relationship with them."
The choice then was whether he should get the vasectomy reversed "and just take shots in the dark, hoping she gets pregnant," he says. But at the time, he was touring with his band, Sixx:A.M., and working on the stage musical adaptation of his 2007 memoir, "The Heroin Diaries: A Year in the Life of a Shattered Rock Star."
"I was like, 'It really needs to be more planned out because I want to be here for my wife, and I want to be here for everything,'" Sixx says. So he opted to undergo a sperm-retrieval procedure, and he and Bingham used artificial insemination to conceive.
"They just had to take it out of me - that's no party getting your (testicles) cut open," he laughs. "Getting your (testicles) cut open is like being in Mötley Crüe in 1987," when the band was partying too hard, and he nearly died of a heroin overdose. "It's the same feeling. But now she's pregnant, and we're super-excited."
Sixx released a new single, "The Dirt" featuring Machine Gun Kelly, last week, which marks Mötley Crüe's first song together since disbanding in 2015.
