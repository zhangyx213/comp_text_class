The so-called "heartbeat ban" isattempting to basically outlaw abortion. At least 15 states to date are trying to enact laws that ban abortion as early as six weeks of gestation, or when the heartbeat can be heard. Most women don't even know they are pregnant six weeks into a pregnancy.
My question is this: Who's going to take care of all the unwanted babies? Are all those evangelical groups or religious folks going to care for the babies? And who's going to help the mothers through the pregnancies or after the babies are born?
Single, poor mothers get slammed for being on any type of government assistance - no one wants to help them. But now you want them to have more babies because it's morally right with your religious beliefs? These women are damned if they do have the child and damned if they don't.
No one religious group has the right to impose its beliefs on others. No woman, man or religious group has the absolute right to rule over women's bodies.
All single males who believe abortion is not morally and religiously right, thus dictating what women can do with their bodies, should practice abstinence or get vasectomies. That would put a stop to millions of unexpected, unwanted pregnancies each year.
Yes, I believe, "What's good for the goose is good for the gander."

Shameful project
The Penn Plaza debacle will stain the legacy of our city officials (April 30,"Whole Foods Returns to Penn Plaza"). And, it will also be another stain on the already shameful history of urban renewal in Pittsburgh. Then, too, the shiny new buildings will be permanently stained by the terrible methods used to breed their birth.
The middle and upper class, who will likely be the primary beneficiaries of the proposed project, should not want to be associated with it. Amazon, Whole Foods Market and others should consider that these structures will be built on a "grave site." Yes, dead dreams are buried here.
A personal code of ethics should discourage any erudite, cultured and civilized person from setting foot on the property of this project. This land has been contaminated by immoral business, social and political practices and by thoughtless insensitivity to human rights. This project brings no pride to the "New East Liberty." It only brings long-lasting shame.

Family values
Well-meaning people have still not learned that you cannot legislate ethics or morality. Writing new laws against hate crimes will do nothing except get some headlines. Lawmakers today have no more power over human behavior than King Canute had in stemming the tides.
Morality, including the concept of hate, starts at home. An intact family, with both parents pulling together, has a huge impact on how or what the child believes later in life.
Our society has also had a very noticeable decline in religious training and attendance in the past 40 years. Every major religion teaches the same basic principles of living together as human beings: compassion, forgiveness and charity.
If we spent more time as a family, openly affirming that certain behavior is not acceptable and articulating what is expected of each of the family members, we would have a real chance of diminishing "hate crimes" and allowing time for our lawmakers to actually create beneficial laws for our society.

Distracted driving
This is in response to the May 8 online article "Driver Charged in Crash that Killed Couple en Route to Their Wedding in Pittsburgh."
The article states, "The Reading Eagle reports that police in Berks County allege he was distracted by a cell phone conversation and didn't see traffic stopped ahead of him before striking another vehicle."
The use of the word"distracted" implies that the driver was being passive, i.e., that something was being done to him. But that's not what happened.
A much more accurate word would be one indicating that the driver was being active. Because that's what actually did happen. There was no "distraction."
Instead, two innocent people were killed.
