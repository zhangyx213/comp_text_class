It was the day of last year's Inverness Christmas parade.
Jim Baird parked a block from Main Street, got down on bended knee in the parking lot and pulled out the diamond chip ring he bought online from Target.
"Will you marry me?" Baird asked.
Then-girlfriend Jo Ann Morin said yes, and the Beverly Hills couple began planning a June ceremony - her second marriage, his third.
Happily ever after? Not quite. This engagement story ended not with a trip to the altar, but with a trip to the Judge Judy television show.
The couple called it quits this past summer, leaving a few financial disputes in the wake of their bitter breakup.
Baird, a building plans examiner for the county, owed $200 to Morin's 16-year-old son for a ticket on the honeymoon cruise that never happened. Morin hadn't returned the $400 ring and still had Baird's gray suit.
And then there was the issue of the vasectomy - which Baird paid for, at Morin's urging.
The Judge Judy show heard about the case and hit pay dirt.
Baird and Morin agreed to drop their case in Citrus County's small claims court, appear on the nationally syndicated show and abide by the ruling from the no-nonsense TV judge, Judith Sheindlin, a retired jurist from New York's family court system.
They each got an all-expenses-paid trip to Hollywood two weeks ago, filmed the show and got $150 for their time.
The show's air date has not been set.
"I wish it wouldn't have all led up to this," Baird, 44, told the Times. "But I thought the show calling me, it was kind of exciting, something I might not be able to do again."
Don't want to know the ending? Don't read any further.
The judge disposed of the case pretty quickly, Baird said.
Morin returned the ring and the gray suit to Baird.
The judge awarded $200 to Morin's son, Christopher, although the show picked up the tab.
About the honeymoon cruise: Baird had bought the tickets for himself and Morin, and Christopher paid for his own $480 ticket for the eight-day trip to the western Caribbean.
When Morin and her son decided not to go, Baird took his two children: Bobbie Sue, 15, and James, 14.
"I said, "It's my vacation; I'm going,' ' Baird said.
Baird gave Christopher $280 toward his ticket and left his $200 gray suit, which he figured made things even.
Morin didn't think so.
"The money he owes my son is for a Carnival cruise (ticket) that he used without permission," Morin wrote in her Sept. 16 small claims court filing. "My son purchased the cruise ticket with his own money that he had been saving for many years."
Morin did not return calls for comment.
And the vasectomy?
Baird wrote in his countersuit: "I also had a vasectomy, thinking I was getting married, at a cost of $580. She didn't marry me, so I believe she owes me this."
Judge Judy didn't buy it.
"She said, "She didn't grab you by the hand and pull you down there,' " Baird said. "And I said, "No, ma'am, not by the hand.' "
