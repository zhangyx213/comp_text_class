ACROSS THE POND
Jealous of the low crime rate in Britain? A new study by the Civitas think tank suggests that safety there may be overstated. According to the research, reported in London's Independent newspaper, the British Crime Survey only counts the first five incidents each year between an offender and a victim. Without that restriction, the researchers say that some violent crimes are much more prevalent than reported, with an overall incidence of 4.4-million cases as opposed to the 2.4-million the government reports. Much of the difference came in domestic violence, which tends to have a high repeat rate.
PSEUDO CELEBRI-SPAWN
Hey! A guy who looks like someone's son!
It is purported to be "news" in some media outlets that Mark Sams, 48, was arrested for impersonating the son of country music singer Merle Haggard. Not Merle Haggard. But Merle Haggard's son. Sams was arrested in Ronan, Mont., after he was signing autographs using Noel Haggard's name, and charging people to have their picture taken with him. The real news may be just beneath the surface in an item like that, though: People would pay to have their picture taken with Merle Haggard's son?
COKE FLOATS
Smuggling failure sets Irish record
The coast of Ireland's County Cork was transformed to County Coke for a brief time Tuesday as a boat smuggling more than 1.5 tons capsized off the coast. Police happened upon the accident as one of the suspected smugglers swam ashore and told them about his friend still in the water. It was then that they also saw the bundles of blow bobbing in the water. Cops estimate that the haul had a value of $145-million, which would be a new record in Ireland. The old record was 660 pounds found in 1998, worth about $83-million.
BREAKUPS ARE TOUGH
Some stuff you get back, some you don't
If a guy's fiancee changes her mind, he can probably expect to get the ring back. But, at least in Utah, he can't expect her to pay for his vasectomy, even if he got it specifically for her. That's what a Salt Lake City court ruled in the case of Layne Hess vs. Jody Johnston. "Hess urges this court to adopt the position that any gift given during the engagement period carries an implied condition of marriage. We decline to do so," the appeals court said in upholding a lower court's ruling. Hess also wanted money back for trips to Alaska and France, and money given to Johnston's son for a car. "We see no benefit in discouraging or penalizing persons who realize ... for whatever reason they are unprepared to take such an important step," the court said.
