Armed and dangerous
Too often, Parkinson’s disease, a degenerative age-related neurological ailment without cure, is diagnosed well after irreparable damage has been done. But that may soon change. Researchers at the Penn State Hershey College of Medicine say gait — the manner in which people walk — could be an early marker for the disease.
“The disease is currently diagnosed by tremors at rest and stiffness in the body and limbs,” said Xuemei Huang,? an associate professor of neurology at Penn State University. “By the time we diagnose the disease, about 50 to 80 percent of the critical cells called dopamine neurons are already dead.”
Huang and colleagues say clinical observations of Parkinson’s patients suggest their arm swing is asymmetrical: One arm swings much less than the other as they walk. The researchers hypothesize that it may be possible to accurately measure arm swing and develop guidelines that could point to the early onset of Parkinson’s before other symptoms appear.
“There are wide-scale efforts to find drugs that slow cell death,” Huang said. “When they are found, they could be used in conjunction with this technique to arrest or perhaps cure the disease because they could be given before great damage has occurred.”
Body of knowledge
According to “The Odd Brain” by Stephen Juan, hospitalized mental patients rarely complain of headaches.
Stories for the waiting room
In the 1700s, it was believed that one way to cure a headache was to tie a piece of hangman’s rope around the skull. Fortunately (or not, depending upon one’s point of view), public hangings were quite common then, and there was an abundance of product, which tended to provide hangmen with a good second income.

Running Planet
runningplanet.com
If your New Year’s resolutions include getting out and pounding the pavement, here’s a good starting line. The site has: how-to guides, from casual runs to marathons; articles about running; and a chat window for fellow runners. This is a commercial site, so, naturally, there are links for running gear sales, coaching services and the like.
Best medicine
Completing an annual physical, a doctor asked his patient if he had any questions or concerns.
“Well,” said the man, “I’m thinking about getting a vasectomy.”
“That’s a pretty big decision,” replied the doctor. “Have you talked it over with your family?”
“Yeah. They’re in favor 15 to 2.”
Observation
No matter how rich you become, how famous or powerful, when you die, the size of your funeral will still pretty much depend on the weather.
— Humorist Michael Pritchard
Medical history
This week in 1896, the first U.S. X-ray photograph was taken by Henry Louis Smith, a professor of physics and astronomy at Davidson College in North Carolina. The 15-minute exposure showed the location of a bullet in the hand of a corpse. Smith, after hearing of Wilhelm Roentgen’s discovery of X-rays in Germany, obtained the hand of the corpse and fired a bullet into it for this experiment. He later published his X-ray photograph in the Charlotte Observer.
Last words
Too late for fruit, too soon for flowers.
— English poet and writer Walter de la Mare (1873-1956)
