Bert Kreischer seems like the kind of guy who would give you the shirt off his back.
Problem is, he doesn't usually have one on. And if he did, it might be too big.
The comedian from St. Petersburg, Fla., known for his topless performing style, has made his name as the lovable party animal.
It began back in 1997 when Rolling Stone featured him as "the top partyer at the Number One Party School in the country," Florida State University. His escapades became the inspiration for the film "Van Wilder."
Kreischer parlayed that success doing and becoming host of the FX TV series "Hurt Bert," and then "Bert the Conqueror" and "Trip Flip" on Travel Channel.
His breakthrough standup success came with "The Machine," a tale about a college trip to Russia in which he, believe it or not, inadvertently helped the mob rob a train. A movie about that adventure is in the making.
For years, Kreischer has been hitting clubs like The Improv. In 2020, during the pandemic, he pioneered the drive-in comedy tour. On Friday, he returns for the first time since then to headline PPG Paints Arena. He spoke with us this week by phone.
Q: I think the last time you were here was the drive-in movie theater in Butler.
Oh s--, that was it. Yeah, that was one of my favorite shows I've ever done. I actually talked about doing my special there.
It must all seem like a dream to you now, having done these shows to people in cars.
You know what, I look back on it so fondly. It's so crazy, kind of the way you look back at freshman year of high school when you're like, "I was terrified. I felt like I didn't know anyone that first week and all of a sudden making friends was awesome."
I look back at it kind of very fondly. I mean, it was a horrible time for our country, but it was really interesting because I got to live in the back of a tour bus and travel with my best friends around the country at a time when nothing was going on and no one was going outside, and we stayed at campgrounds that were completely empty. We hit golf balls out in Butler. It was a really interesting experience
I guess some people were maybe out of the car, so you could hear them laugh a little bit.
That first show I did in North Carolina, I noticed the difference. I was like, "F---, this is quiet." Then the more I did it, the more I got accustomed with it being the new norm. Butler was a real gem because of the staged infield, so every car was like 5-10 feet above the car in front of it, so it was it was like playing a stadium, everything was on top of each other. It was a dream come true. It was one of the best shows we did without a doubt, the whole f---ing tour.
So, you go way back with your experiences in Pittsburgh. ...
It was one of the first places that I ever could kind of draw, where you could build a fanbase, and usually it was radio that was cool to you and let you come in. I told "The Machine" story on WDVE very early in my career. Before I told it on Rogan, I told it on WDVE. Pittsburgh, D.C. and Tampa were like my big markets.
That was probably with Jimmy Krenn.
I think that was Jimmy and Randy [Baumann].
Now, you're coming to the arena, which holds like 16,000. How do you adapt to that change in scale?
It's interesting. I think the adaptation really is from clubs to theaters. That's the big adaptation you notice because clubs are right on your toenails. Everyone's like right there and when you go into a theater, it's the first time you realize "I need to slow it down. I need to be more of an act. I can't do crowd work. I can't lean on crowd work if I get into a bind. I have to have a legit hour and 15 minutes worth of material to make sure I can fill an hour."
One of the first theaters I ever did was the WDVE Comedy Festival, I told "The Machine" there, and I wasn't doing theaters at the time. That's the big leap, and then once you go from theaters on, everything is all the same. Arenas are a little different in that you gotta fill the space and you do that with walking around, but when you go back to clubs, that's when you notice the difference.
So do you do "The Machine" story like all the time. Is that something you have to do?
The advice I got from every comic, every peer of mine was "You gotta retire that story, you gotta close it." Like Ron White had his "tater salad" story, which was probably one of the biggest stories in comedy, and he just retired it. He said, "I'm not telling it anymore" and his fans rode with him.
I'm very grateful. I'm hyper aware at what my life would have been like had that story not changed my life. Because I was there. I got fired from the Travel Channel. My wife was redoing our house. She wanted me to get a vasectomy. I was done. I wasn't selling tickets before that story popped, and I remember wishing like, "God, I wish I had one story that people identified with, that would put me over, that people would like." And I got it. You know, be careful what you wish for, and and they still cheer for it. As long as they cheer for it, I'll tell it because I'm not aboveâ€¦ I'm not some heady comic that needs to be anything more than you want me to be. As long as you let me do an hour's worth of new material, so I can get ready for my next special, I'll tell whatever story you want to hear at the end. I'm very grateful that anyone comes to see me live.
Like Springsteen playing "Born to Run" or something. Does it change from night to night? Do you improvise on it?
Yeah. I mean, candidly, I get tired. I think part of why it's had this lasting power is that it is a story, and stories are not always the same. They morph. So, uh, it changes. I mean, last night I sang the national anthem in the middle of it, so you never know what you're gonna get.
How'd you do on the high note?
Uh, I murdered it. I have a beautiful singing voice [laughs].
When did no-shirt thing start? How did that start?
You know, in all honesty, I used to go on stage, rip my shirt off, kill a beer. That was my go-to Thursday, because you had a long weekend ahead of you. And I always wanted to remind myself, "This is a one-show night, this should be fun. You should have a good time. I know you miss your family, I know you want to be home, I know you wish you were making more money, I know you wish there were more people in here, but the people in here deserve to have a good time and you need to remember that this should be fun."
So I used to do that and I would do it sometimes early show Friday, late show Friday. And then one time I did it in Columbus, Ohio, and I forgot to put my shirt back on. I used to put my shirt right back on. I forgot and like 10 minutes, 15 minutes into my set, I was like "Oh, sh--, I should put my shirt on" and I went to put it on and this woman in the back goes, [in a deep voice] "Keep it off." And it got a big laugh, and I kept it off, and I kept going back as if I was gonna put it on and I never put it on.
And a comic I really respect was like, "You know, I can't believe you did any material with your shirt off, let alone a whole hour." He was like, "No one could do that," and in a weird way I thought it would be a great way to practice standup and then when I got ready for a special, I'd throw a shirt on and I'd just murder. It would have been like swimming in overalls. But then when I got to do the special, I realized I haven't done standup with a shirt on in nine years. So, I was, "Sh--, I guess I gotta do this shirtless."
Joe's probably told you about carnivore and keto.
Yeah.
What would happen if you listened to Joe and then you lost like a bunch of weight and got ripped? Like, would you be funny?
Yeah. I think so. I mean, here's the thing: I've thought about that a lot. Number one, I would love to find out. I would love to get ripped. It would be so cool. Don't think that I haven't been trying to get ripped for the past 10 years. Like, I would love to get ripped. I would love to be in good shape. I think the people that think you wouldn't be funny don't think you're funny right now. I think that your fans would go with you no matter where you go. I think fans are ride or die. I don't think they're like "I need Bert to be fat for his standup to be funny." I mean, people enjoy my podcast and they don't really see me. Um, maybe if I was completely shredded, I wouldn't be as relatable, you know?
I don't think we're running into that issue any time soon. I would love to be shredded, but I can't get there. Part of the thing that makes me maybe approachable is that I like to have beers and hang out after a show. If I was that guy that was ripped I couldn't hang out with fans, I couldn't have beers. I'd have to go back to my bed and get 10 hours sleep and I'd have to get up early and work out and I'd be on steroids.â€¦ I think those are the variables in that, but I think ultimately if I lost weight and looked good, I don't think anyone has a problem with looking at anything that looks good.
I guess there have been cases where comedians have slimmed down, like, I don't know, maybe Jonah Hill, where people don't think they're as funny.
Oh man, I love Jonah Hill. In my opinion, there's been times when Jonah Hill's been too overweight. You know, like "War Dogs." I think he looked uncomfortable. You know, I think a happy artist is a good artist, so whatever the f--- you gotta do to make yourself happy... I was 265 at my heaviest, probably 270, and I think that was a detriment to my standup. I think people were looking at me and they're like, "He doesn't look healthy. He's partying too hard." I've always shot my specials at 230. At 230, I look OK with clothes on, and when I take my shirt off, I look a little doughy, but I don't think I look too fat.
On Rogan, you briefly alluded to a joke about a "spirit animal" and someone getting offended. How much do you feel, in this day and age of social media, that you have to self-censor and avoid the cancel culture?
I don't avoid cancel culture. I look at this way. I look at cancel culture the same way I look at sharks in the ocean. If you focus on the sharks, then the ocean's no fun. It just becomes terrifying. And if you look at standup in the same manner and all you think about is cancel culture, then standup is no fun. You gotta kinda just jump in and enjoy it, and if you get bit, you get bit.
I think the onus, when it comes to anything I say, is to try to somewhat be aware that there are things you can say that may hurt someone's feelings. Like, there are words I try to avoid. But that's only because I don't have the intent. I'm not that comic. Like, I'm not Bill Burr. I don't just not give a f---. I give a f--. I give a f--- because I wanna make sure that everyone who comes into my show has a good time. I don't want anyone to leave going like, "Well that kinda sucks. I'm that thing. Why did he have to pick that one thing out?"
I'm not the guy that's like "Everyone gets it from Bert, you know, everyone's fair game." My act is that I pretty much talk about myself and my family and so it would be a little out of the blue if I wasâ€¦ Look, I have glaring blind spots that I don't see because of just who I am and my upbringing, and I try to be somewhat aware of just how my words affect people, but at the same time I'm not sitting there going like, "I can't say what I wanna say." I think people overthink it a tad, but whatever, I'm sure it'll catch me someday.
I'm sure you haven't had those moments where you're like there's a video of you and they're like, oh look what you said.
I don't really Google myself anymore. I mean, there are people that obsess about that. Listen, I'm gonna ballpark I've done about 10,000 hours worth of podcasting. I'm certain there's stuff that can be taken out of context and I'm certain there's stuff in context that I laughed at that I shouldn't have laughed at, or that I said. I think living in the past is not the best way to go about trying to create your new hour.
Last thing: what's the status of the movie?
Uh, we are in a holding pattern.
That doesn't sound good.
No, I mean, none of it's good. There's the conflict in Ukraine and Russia. It's not ideal to try to release a movie about Russia. And I think we both can agree I'm probably the last person that should be on the "Today" show giving my opinion on anything, so they just don't want me to be sitting out there trying to promote a movie when, you know, it's a tough time for that area and bad things are happening. And then what am I gonna do? Go up and be like ripping my shirt off, killing a beer and going, "You guys gotta see my movie!"
The show is at 7:30 p.m. Friday. Tickets are $23.75; ticketmaster.com.
