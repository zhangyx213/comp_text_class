  A CULTURE BATTLE IN SPAIN OVER A PROPOSED ABORTION LAW
  Since he became prime minister of Spain in 2004, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero has pushed an ambitious series of reforms, prying the social fabric of the country from the centuries-old grip of the Roman Catholic Church. Mr. Zapatero's latest venture is into even more incendiary social terrain, the divide over abortion. And if he was looking for a battle, he found one. PAGE A4
  FUNERAL FOR MOST VICTIMS OF QUAKE
  Thousands of weeping mourners took part in an emotional funeral Mass for 205 victims of the earthquake that devastated the mountainous Abruzzo region of central Italy on Monday. In all, the earthquake left 290 people dead and 28,000 homeless. PAGE A4
  SUICIDE ATTACK KILLS SEVEN IN IRAQ
  Five American soldiers and two members of the Iraqi security forces were killed in a brazen suicide truck bombing in Mosul, a United States military spokesman said. It was the deadliest attack against American soldiers in Iraq in 13 months.  PAGE A4
  EXTENT OF GENDER TILT IN CHINA
  A paper in the British Medical Journal says that in China, there are 32 million more boys under the age of 20 than girls. The finding, the paper's authors wrote, was perhaps unsurprising in light of the country's one-child policy. The disparity is almost entirely because of sex-selective abortion, the authors wrote.

  RECOUNT OF VOTES IN MOLDOVA
  Standing in the lobby of the presidential palace, where graffiti and broken windows spoke of this week's violent protests, President Vladimir Voronin of Moldova announced a recount of votes in the disputed parliamentary elections. PAGE A6

  A Black Imam Breaking Ground
  Sheik Adil Kalbani, an imam in Saudi Arabia, became the first black man to lead prayers in Mecca after being chosen by King Abdullah. Many have hailed his selection as more evidence of King Abdullah's cautious efforts to move Saudi Arabia toward greater openness and tolerance in the last few years.  PAGE A6
  COURT RULES CONTRACTOR MUST PAY
  A federal appeals court ruled that a contractor found to have committed widespread fraud in Iraq could not avoid paying millions of dollars in damages by claiming that the relevant United States law did not apply in Iraq, as a previous judge had found on technical grounds. The appeals judgment reverses a decision that had put a chill on dozens of pending cases involving contracting in Iraq.  PAGE A6
  GEORGIAN PRESIDENT SAYS HE'LL STAY
  President Mikheil Saakashvili of Georgia, who came to power in one progressive uprising but is now the target of another, declared that he would not resign. PAGE A7

  OPPONENTS OF GAY MARRIAGE
  To Raise Pressure on Iowa Officials
  Opponents of last week's Iowa Supreme Court ruling allowing same-sex marriages said that they would step up pressure on state lawmakers to block the marriages through a constitutional amendment and predicted political fallout for any state leaders that did not join the opposition. Above, Mike Boone, of Ankeny, Iowa, stands with his wife Joni during an opening prayer at a rally against gay marriage in front of the Statehouse in Des Moines.   PAGE A8
  TAX-CHEAT LIST FINDS A-LIST NAMES
  With California facing a severe budget deficit, the pressure to squeeze money out of tax delinquents is more intense this year. The state released its annual list of California's worst tax scofflaws, which included the actor Burt Reynolds and the singer Dionne Warwick.   PAGE A8
  LIFE AFTER THE PRESIDENCY
  A tanned and rested George W. Bush is emerging from seclusion to begin his life since the presidency with a reunion of sorts of the old gang next week. But more important, Mr. Bush is trying to map out what he wants to do with the rest of his life.  PAGE A9
  ACTING ON CLIMATE WITH CAUTION
  President Obama came to office promising swift action to combat global climate change, and yet the administration has taken a rather passive stance on the issue, remaining aloof from the details of major energy and climate legislation now in Congress.   PAGE A10
  New York
  MAYOR MAINTAINS OPTIMISM
  On Pledge to Save Jobs
  Despite a steady stream of gloomy predictions about New York's economy, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is holding firm to a bold promise: to ''create or save'' 400,000 jobs in the city over the next six years.  PAGE A12
  PROTESTERS ARRESTED AT NEW SCHOOL
  Twenty-two people were arrested for occupying a building on the New School campus in Manhattan, demanding that the school's embattled president, Bob Kerrey, be ousted. PAGE A12
  Business
  IN AN AGE OF AUSTERITY, THE FRUGAL FLOURISH
  Millions of Americans have trimmed expenses because of job loss, or in fear of it. But some savers are reducing costs not just with purpose, but with relish. These are the gleefully frugal.   PAGE B1
  TEMPTED TO CHEAT ON TAXES
  The most recent Internal Revenue Service statistics estimate that 86 percent of taxes owed are collected. The biggest portion of uncollected tax revenue was from people who run cash-intensive businesses like plumbers or other sole proprietors.   PAGE B1
  Patient Money
  No Money, No Baby.
  Although it is too early to proclaim a bona fide trend in elective sterilization, urologists and clinics have noticed an uptick in recent months in the number of men requesting vasectomies. Above, Dr. Charles Wilson and a patient, Michael Swogger, at The Vasectomy Clinic in Seattle. Dr. Wilson holds an instrument called a Wilson Vasectomy Forcep used in the procedure.  PAGE B1

  DOCTORS SEE A HEALTHY CHALLENGE
  The Obama administration is promising to spend billions to make health care more efficient. And while 8 in 10 American doctors still labor in a world of paper, some doctors have encountered upsetting setbacks when they tried to switch to electronic records.  PAGE B3

  Obituaries
  DAVE ARNESON, 61
  Through the popular game he helped create, Dungeons & Dragons, he spawned a new form of interpersonal entertainment that has captivated millions.  PAGE B8
  I. HERBERT SCHEINBERG, 89
  As a specialist in rare hereditary diseases, he helped develop a diagnostic test and treatment for Wilson disease, a potentially fatal buildup of copper in the body.  PAGE B8

  GETTING THE MONEY WAS HARD,
  Doling It Out Is Even Harder
  More than 2,000 applications have arrived at the National Endowment for the Arts from cultural organizations all over the country seeking some piece of the stimulus pie allotted to the arts by President Obama. The endowment now faces the tough task of determining which groups are most deserving.   PAGE C1
  Theater Review
  Couples Therapy, Tyler Perry Style
  Sermons and smackdowns vie for supremacy in the universe of Tyler Perry, the creative impresario who presides over an expanding kingdom of black entertainment. And like his previous plays, the latest, ''Tyler Perry's The Marriage Counselor,'' is less standard stage works than odd admixtures of gospel-pop concert, comedy show and church service.   PAGE C1
  HIT SHOWS, BUT NO THEATER
  No New York theater company has experienced anything like the recent artistic highs and economic lows of the Theater for a New Audience. Even with its hit shows, the company is neither making much money nor has the flexibility to extend them for longer runs. What is lacking for this not-for-profit theater company is a theater of its own. PAGE C1
  THE MAN BEHIND THE STORIES
  Getting to know Wells Tower, whose book of short stories, ''Everything Ravaged, Everything Burned,'' has attracted a great number admiring critics in the few weeks since it came out.   PAGE C1
  DISNEY BRINGS NATURE TO CHILDREN
  ''Earth'' is not routine, the G-rated movie marks the Walt Disney Company's high-profile return to the nature genre and presents it with a difficult balancing act. The film centers on three animal families that struggle to survive over the course of a year. So, how do you explain to children why a cheetah eats a peppy little gazelle?  PAGE C1

  SPIRITUALITY CATCHES A BREAK ON TV
  Channel surf the TV and you'll rarely encounter anyone talking about spiritual matters, unless it's a paid program. ''Global Spirit,'' a series that begins Sunday on Link TV  is hoping to change that, and to capitalize on what the program's creators see as a growing interest in spiritual exploration.  PAGE C3

  Music Review
  The Sax Trio Is Back from a Hiatus
  It's good to hear this group again, Ben Ratliff writes about Fly, the saxophone trio group that has a new record-- ''Sky & Country,'' on ECM -- and is reconvening at the Jazz Standard through the weekend. PAGE C5

  AFTER A GENTLE ROUND 1,
  A Tougher Masters
  In first round of the 2009 Masters tournament Thursday at the Augusta National Golf Club, a record 38 players broke par. That led some observers to wonder whether the course was too welcoming. That wasn't quite the case Friday after Round 2.  PAGE D1

  BIDDING A FINAL GOODBYE
  Waving and doffing his cap to acknowledge a prolonged standing ovation, Gary Player genuflected on the 18th green to bid the Masters goodbye after his 52nd and final appearance as a player.   PAGE D3

  This Weekend
  MAGAZINE
  Western Christianity is being transformed by the religiosity of the developing world. Missionaries from African churches, like the Redeemed Christian Church of God, are evangelizing around the globe. Can a Nigerian Pentecostal movement take root in American soil?  PAGE 30  
  Keeping Up With Being Kept 38 
  BOOK REVIEW
  ''The Song Is You,'' is another departure in Arthur Phillips' career of radical departures. This novel is a pas de deux between a singer and the man who obsessively inspires her. Or maybe it's about a man who is so moved by a woman's voice that he goes a little berserk before he emerges into a deeper sanity. Or maybe it's about the ways an artist is affected by her audience. Or all of the above, and more.  PAGE 1 
  ARTS & LEISURE
  The subject of a retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art, Mike Nichols is not an obvious choice for the artsy and highbrow film department. MoMA retrospectives tend to be awarded to brooding European auteurs and not to commercial Hollywood directors who include on their resume hits like ''Working Girl.''  PAGE 1 
  TRAVEL
  More than 500 species of birds live or migrate through Belize, where frigate-spring birds share coastal waters with pelicans and red-footed boobies. Inland,  residents like royal flycatchers, olive-throated parakeets, keel-billed toucans and dozens more can be spotted on a hike in the Chiquibul Forest Reserve of Western Belize.  PAGE 6 
  SUNDAY STYLES
  Once thought of as a destination for lefty radicals committed to living lives of low pay, frustration and bitter burnout, community organizing is now in resurgence, seen by many college graduates as an exciting career. And these jobs, students say, can actually lead to ... well, you know.

  Editorial
  A MISSION FOR GOV. PATERSON
  Gov. David Paterson has promised again to push for a same-sex marriage bill in New York State. This is a basic civil right that has been denied to New York's gay residents for too long. For Mr. Paterson, this decent and important change could also give him a much needed political, as well as moral victory.  Page A16
  A SEAT AT THE HUMAN RIGHTS TABLE
  The Obama administration has decided to run for a seat on the United Nations' highly dysfunctional Human Rights Council. That may be the best chance to shape up this international embarrassment, but it won't be easy.  Page A16
  DR. LUBCHENCO AND THE SALMON
  Jane Lubchenco, the new leader of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, will have to devise a solution to the grave threats facing the salmon runs of the Pacific Northwest. She has the skills and, we hope, the will to do it.  Page A16

  GAIL COLLINS
  Happy holidays! This is one of those times of year when families and friends can forget their troubles and join together for a Passover Seder, as President Obama did on Thursday, or commemorate Easter with the traditional egg hunt, as President Obama will do on Monday. Americans with less religious inclinations can look forward to the coming Earth Day and Arbor Day celebrations.  Page A17
  FINDING OUR WAY BACK TO LENT
  With the end of Lent, James Carroll, the author of ''Practicing Catholic,'' reflects on the power of the observance in troubled times.  Page A17
