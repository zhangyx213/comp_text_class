ST. LOUIS - Margot Riphagen has overcome some of the most difficult challenges within the health sector: She led efforts to unionize tens of thousands of health care workers, developed the COVID-19 testing program for New York City schools during the pandemic and increased abortion access in some of the most politically hostile states across the South.
Those experiences, coupled with her commitment to the community she grew up in, will help her as the new president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Rivers, Riphagen says.
"I know that real change, when we are talking about access to health care, really happens locally. And Missouri is my home," she said. "St. Louis is the place I care about more than any other city, and coming back and being able to fight for change ... this really is me stepping into my dream role to be able to lead this organization."
Riphagen, 43, begins her new role today, officials announced. She replaces Yamelsie Rodriguez, who resigned in February of last year after serving as CEO since 2019. Richard Muniz, the organization's general counsel, filled in as the interim director during the leadership search.
Planned Parenthood Great Rivers operates six clinics. Three are located in the St. Louis area; the others are in Rolla and Springfield in Missouri and Fairview Heights in Illinois.
The clinics handle more than 45,000 patient visits a year and provide contraception, tests for sexually transmitted infections, cancer screenings, vasectomies, HPV vaccines and gender-affirming hormone therapy, annual reports show. The Fairview Heights clinic provides about 10,000 abortions a year.
Riphagen takes the helm of the 90-year-old organization after returning to St. Louis in April of last year to serve as its vice president of external affairs, where she led legislative and electoral efforts, the sex education team and creating partnerships with other community organizations.
She led Great Rivers' work to help put Amendment 3 on the November ballot, which voters approved, enshrining into the state constitution the right to an abortion up to "fetal viability" - the point at which a fetus might survive outside the uterus, which takes into account many complex factors.
Despite the amendment's passage, the fight to provide abortions in Missouri is far from over and the biggest challenge Riphagen will face.
That's because abortion providers still face a long list of state licensing restrictions on abortion facilities that make it nearly impossible to operate. Great Rivers and Planned Parenthood Great Plains have joined in a lawsuit to remove the restrictions, which has resulted a lengthy court battle with the Missouri attorney general's office.
Republican lawmakers have also already filed dozens of bills to weaken Amendment 3 and even overturn it by taking the issue to the voters again.
The new speaker of the House, state Rep. Jon Patterson of Lee's Summit, made clear in a speech last week that he wanted to limit the availability of abortion.
"As we respect the will of the people, we must clarify the provisions of Amendment 3 and make Missouri the most pro-life state it can be," Patterson told the House.
Still, Riphagen said she remains optimistic. She sees momentum behind the grassroots efforts that led to getting enough signatures to place Amendment 3 on the ballot and win approval.
"One of the main ways that we go forward here is to continue to activate and to engage the supporters who passed Amendment 3," she said, "bringing them to Jeff City to talk to the Legislature, having in-district meetings ... making sure that their voices continue to be heard and that we hold elected officials accountable."
Great Rivers board member Deborah Patterson, who served as co-chair of the search committee for the new director, said Riphagen was chosen from among 55 applicants.
The board was impressed, Patterson said, with Riphagen's desire to work in the challenging fields of labor organizing and reproductive rights.
"To stay the course, it takes a person with grit, confidence, ability to build trusting relationships, a strategic thinker and great political instincts," Patterson said. "And that is Margot."
<h2>Drawn to labor movement</h2>
Riphagen was 4 years old when her family emigrated from the Netherlands and settled in in Creve Coeur. She earned a bachelor's degree in international studies at DePaul University and a master's degree in public health from Creighton University.
She was first drawn into the labor movement, unionizing home health care workers and home child care providers across the Midwest. In 2008, back in St. Louis, she unionized 13,000 home health workers in Missouri.
On the West Coast, she organized EMS workers, and while living nearly eight years in New York City, she worked for the national union for resident physicians.
Riphagen eventually became that union's executive director, growing the organization from 13,000 members to 30,000, she said. Physicians' working conditions improved, and they gained more input into how patients should be treated.
It was in this role, she said, where she learned the importance of focusing on staff and patients.
"One of the things that I've learned throughout my organizing career and throughout my work is it all means nothing if we're not centering those who are most impacted," she said.
After the pandemic hit, Riphagen honed her leadership skills when she was tapped to run the COVID-19 testing program for New York City public schools. She faced the logistical challenges of creating something never been done before; communicating with multiple contractors, employees and families; and staying abreast with the latest science.
Between 2013 and 2015, before her work in New York, Riphagen worked in New Orleans for Planned Parenthood's national office, expanding abortion access across eight states from Oklahoma to Florida.
Riphagen says she saw how educating others about services Planned Parenthood provides beyond abortion ended up improving access to abortion.
She trained local affiliates on building broad coalitions with other organizations involved in reproductive health, she said, so that when it came time to open an abortion clinic, they saw less pushback.
"Folks understood that Planned Parenthood is so much more than abortion," she said, "It's about fundamentally making sure that wherever Planned Parenthood is operating, that folks have access to the care that they need in a way that leaves politicians out of their health care decisions."
Deborah Patterson said she and the other board members liked that Riphagen had experience expanding abortion access in other politically hostile states like Missouri. Riphagen also vowed to make staff feel valued.
"That means she understands people are key to sustaining and growing our services," Patterson said. "That deep respect for people was also critical to us."
<h2>'Changing hearts and minds'</h2>
After Riphagen's work in New York, she returned to work to improve abortion access in 2022 as senior director of national and state campaigns for NARAL Pro-Choice America, now known as Reproductive Free for All.
Focusing on so many states left her feeling uprooted, she said. She knew she wanted to work at a community level.
"When I thought, 'Where do I want to be more than anywhere else?' It was this city," she said. "And when I thought about where are my skills most needed, it's here. It's in the place that I call home, and it's in working with other people who love this city as much as I do."
While the lawsuit seeking to remove barriers to abortion access in Missouri plays out, Riphagen said she will focus on continuing to provide care for patients.
That means strengthening the Fairview Heights clinic, she said, which Great Rivers opened in October of 2019 just across the border in Illinois. With fewer restrictions, the clinic has become a key location for Missourians seeking an abortion as well as thousands of patients traveling from other states with abortion bans.
Planned Parenthood and Hope Clinic in Granite City also launched in January 2022 the Regional Logistics Center, which helps patients covers costs for travel, child care and missing work.
"When I think about the Amendment 3 win, I can't think about it in isolation," she said. "I think about how do we as an organization continue to expand access in innovative ways, like we have at Fairview Heights, making sure that not only folks from around the country but that Missourians know that it is there. And that they can get there, that we provide them the resources to get the care that they need."
When President-elect Donald Trump takes office Jan. 20, Riphagen also faces possible threats to abortion access at the federal level. Trump has been inconsistent on his stance, stating that states should determine their own polices while also signaling support for nationwide ban after 15 weeks' gestation.
Policy experts fear his administration could also enact rules restricting access to abortion pills, especially when delivered by mail. Medication abortions accounted for 63% of all abortions in 2023, according to the Guttmacher Institute.
Riphagen said while she will work closely with the national Planned Parenthood office to fight national restrictions, she plans to focus her efforts on pressuring local and state officials.
"We have an enormous opportunity to be able to implement Amendment 3," she said. "From my perspective, it truly is about keeping it local and making sure that we are fighting back against what's happening around here."
Riphagen is not daunted by the constant political efforts to shutter Planned Parenthood and insists a "brighter future" is to come.
She said, "I have built a career around changing hearts and minds."
