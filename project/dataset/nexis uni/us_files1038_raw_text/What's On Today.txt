10:30 P.M. (TCM) THE EASTWOOD FACTOR Turner Classic Movies celebrates the 80th birthday of Clint Eastwood, left, with an all-day movie marathon centered on this new documentary from Richard Schickel, which aims to define what makes Mr. Eastwood -- actor, four-time Oscar-winning director and composer -- the man he is. Morgan Freeman, who played Nelson Mandela in Mr. Eastwood's ''Invictus,'' narrates. The tribute begins with a trilogy of Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, starting at 8 a.m. with ''A Fistful of Dollars'' (1964), starring Mr. Eastwood as a mysterious stranger who plays dueling families against each other in a Mexican border town, and followed at 9:45 by ''For a Few Dollars More'' (1965) and at noon by ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' (1966). Mr. Eastwood steps into his signature role of Harry Callahan, a maverick San Francisco police detective, in a double bill of ''Dirty Harry'' (1971) at 12:15 a.m. Tuesday and ''Magnum Force'' (1973) at 2 a.m.
