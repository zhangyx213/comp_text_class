VISTA -- A Vista mother charged with murder after her newborn baby was found dead near a garbage can outside her home pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter yesterday.
Edith Ledesma, 25, faces a maximum sentence of 11 years in prison when she is set to be sentenced Sept. 26. Even though the mother could be given probation, Superior Court Judge Timothy Casserly indicated Ledesma will likely be sent to prison.
Prosecutor Per Hellstrom said in an interview that Ledesma's defense attorney, Deputy Public Defender Matt Roberts, told him his client was willing to plead guilty to voluntary manslaughter. District Attorney Bonnie Dumanis eventually accepted the offer, which allows the judge to set the sentence.
Ledesma, the mother of three other children, had doubted she was pregnant because her longtime boyfriend had undergone a vasectomy and she did not feel the baby move, Roberts said in an interview.
On May 13, 2006, she went into labor at her Portia Avenue home. She eventually gave birth to a healthy baby boy, but went into shock after losing seven pints of blood, Roberts said.
In that confused state, she placed the baby outside in a blanket until she could figure out what to do with the child, Roberts said.
Ledesma was later taken to Tri-City Medical Center in Oceanside and did not tell authorities about the baby for two days, according to testimony from an earlier hearing.
The boy died from a lack of oxygen and could have lived for up to several hours before he died, according to testimony from a previous hearing.
The mother feared her boyfriend would not accept the child since he had earlier accused her of being unfaithful, Roberts said. DNA tests determined the boyfriend -- who missed a follow-up appointment to confirm that the vasectomy had worked -- fathered the boy, the lawyer said.
"She clearly accepts she has some responsibility in this," Roberts said in an interview. "She's devastated and heartbroken."
Ledesma will remain in jail until her sentencing hearing. Her three children are being cared for by Ledesma's parents and her estranged boyfriend, who fathered the children.
