Body


I write in regard to an Oct. 13 letter to the editor arguing in favor of abortion rights. I have a few responses:
The writer argues that it "is far worse for a child to be born into poverty." Far worse than what? Death by abortion?
In the writer's concluding paragraph, all her suggestions for cutting down on the need for abortions involve men - vasectomies, contraceptives, etc. Do women have no role in preventing pregnancy?
And because the writer wants to throw out statistics, how about this one: From the legalization of abortion in the U.S. in 1973 to 2011, roughly 50 million unborn children have lost their lives. (That figure is from the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion.) Are we to believe that these children were all rescued from a worse fate?
