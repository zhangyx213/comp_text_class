Driving between Branson and St. Louis recently to attend conferences on billboard regulation, I (and several board members of Scenic America) could see this vast region of Missouri for the first time.
We had been told by our peers at the state affiliate of Scenic Missouri to expect mile after mile of billboards, even in rural areas. But the blight was even more widespread than we had expected. Even in rural areas, sign after sign blanketed the journey.
Dozens of signs failed to carry any advertising at all, while the majority of those that did lacked a legitimate travel-oriented purpose. Instead, they advertised everything from adult sex shops to vasectomy reversals. We all agreed that no other state in which we have traveled had so much beauty hidden behind so many billboards.
An astonishing 2,189 billboards line Missouri's two most traveled interstates - 70 and 44. What are the costs when billboards become so common as to define the landscape, as they do on these roads in Missouri?
The costs of roadside blight can be high, particularly for states with high scenic beauty and tourism potential. Offering scenic landscapes is particularly important for the most sought-after type of tourist: the "heritage" tourist. The heritage tourist is particularly interested in the culture and history of a region. Heritage tourists stay longer and spend more money than any other type of tourist.
That is why some states, including Vermont, Maine, Hawaii and Alaska, do not allow any billboards. And many others have strict laws to rein in billboard blight to ensure that visitors leave with a good impression of their state and a desire to return.
A 2001 study for the state Department of Natural Resources found that heritage tourists in Missouri directly generated more than $600 million annually and created 20,000 jobs. At the same time, a 2005 study for the Division of Tourism found that one of the primary reasons heritage tourists gave for choosing neighboring states over Missouri for their travel is that Missouri was less scenic as its neighboring states.
As Scenic Missouri assures us, Missouri is a splendidly beautiful state - with state parks, scenic rivers and historic communities that are second to none. But with its major interstates littered by unrelenting billboard blight, visitors are not encouraged to linger and explore a beautiful state. Rather, they are encouraged to ignore the scenery hiding behind all the signs and reach their destination as quickly as possible.
The news is not all bad for Missouri's landscapes. An improved state billboard law enacted in 2002 has stopped the growth of new billboards by increasing the minimum distance between signs. And plans by the Department of Transportation to improve major highways, including interstates 70 and 44, in the coming years could spell the removal of hundreds of billboards.
Scenic roads are big business. And while major highways may not be expected to contain quite the same charm as a scenic byway off the beaten path, they should be attractive and give visitors a good first impression. By making a commitment to improve the image of Missouri's highways, the state can leave behind the fierce roadside advertising wars that blight its beauty. The image left of Missouri's highways should be of its wildflowers, prairies, rolling hills, working farms and attractive communities - not sign after sign of sex shops, fireworks and casinos.
Keeping the improved billboard law intact and making a commitment to landscape enhancements as the state improves its highway system will not only create a more pleasing highway system, but it also will be a financial windfall for Missouri by increasing heritage tourism in the state.
