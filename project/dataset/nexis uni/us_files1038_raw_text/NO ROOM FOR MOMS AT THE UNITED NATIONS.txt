The Millennium Summit at the United Nations is history, and 147 posturing world leaders have finally left town - vowing to deliver billions from war, ignorance, destitution and global suffering.
But here's what's really going on at the UN - and it's got nothing to do with world salvation: Nations are being ordered to "downplay" motherhood and "phase out" accompanying traditions like Mother's Day because a team of international civil servants views "the mother image" as a "harmful stereotype."
Member states are also being directed to stop viewing women in the "noble roles" of wife, mother and caregiver. Never mind that women are being mutilated in Cameroon, slave-trafficked in Kyrgyzstan and banned from the outdoors in Afghanistan.
What's gotten into the vichyssoise at Turtle Bay?
Flash back to 1980: A high-minded Jimmy Carter inks the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, a human-rights treaty that promises, at least on paper, equality in jobs, health care, education, suffrage and legal and marital rights.
The treaty is eventually ratified by 165 out of 188 UN members and helps heighten awareness of horrors like honor killings, genital mutilation and sexual trafficking in young girls. But for all its lofty goals, it turns pernicious as feminist functionaries on First Ave. instruct sovereign nations on how to behave - and gloss over genuine abominations to focus on politically correct ideological aims.
Take China. Like all signatories, it submits a report on its treatment of women to a convention committee, which makes recommendations after evaluating performance. Remember, this is a nation that issues pregnancy permits and violently enforces a one-child-per-family limit.
But UNifemers, who traditionally champion reproductive freedom, raise no objections to this, thus putting their imprimatur on a "population policy" that robs 22% of the world's women of the right to chose the size of their own families.
Far more disturbing to treaty trustees: Prostitution is illegal in China; they urge its decriminalization.
The panel does express "concerns" about female infanticide and forced sterilization. But if citizens are stripped by the state of the power to reproduce, why not target men instead of discriminating against women? "Vasectomy is far less intrusive and costly than tubal ligation," committee members write.
Congress never ratified the convention because there was no push for it in the 12 Reagan-Bush years and it was roadblocked by an obdurate Jesse Helms in the eight Clinton years. Probably just as well. Globe-trotting UN rapporteurs have:
* Reproached Belarus for celebrating Mother's Day and offering a Mother's Award, thus fostering "sex-role stereotypes" that "encourage women's traditional roles."
* Urged Armenia to exploit the schools and electronic media "to combat the traditional stereotype of women in 'the noble role of mother.' "
* Implored Ireland to expunge a pro-family clause from its constitution that poses hurdles to women's participation in public life because it refers to their role "in the home and as mothers."
* Lectured Slovenia that too many of its children under age 3 are being cared for by family members, thus "missing out on educational and social opportunities" offered in formal day care.
* Instructed Libya to "review and reinterpret" the Koran "in a more progressive way" because "religions should evolve over time" to promote the advancement of women.
Fortunately, CEDAW has no enforcement mechanism and panel recommendations have no legal standing. But the impact on states is corrosive when a well-intentioned treaty becomes a vehicle to denigrate family, motherhood, religion and morality. That is not the mission of the United Nations.
