Women aren't contracting sexually transmitted diseases and getting pregnant on their own, but relatively little attention has been paid to the sexual and reproductive health of men, says a report out today.
Researchers from the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a non-profit group that focuses on sexual and reproductive health research, compiled and analyzed national survey data about heterosexual men's needs in this area.
"There are significant gaps in meeting men's needs," says David Landry, senior research associate in Guttmacher's New York office.
Landry cites two basic problems. While many women visit doctors annually for pelvic exams and Pap smears, there is no obvious place for men to go for routine sexual and reproductive health care.
In fact, he notes, there isn't even an agreed-upon definition of sexual and reproductive health care for men.
Men can visit a clinic for treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, or STDs, and they can consult with a urologist when considering a vasectomy. Otherwise, young men in particular are unlikely to see a doctor or nurse about their sexual or reproductive health, Landry says.
Much of sex ed in school comes too late for adolescent males, he says. By age 14, half of all boys have entered puberty.
Shortly before age 17, half of all young men have had sexual intercourse.
By age 20, 90% of men have had intercourse, and nearly a third of them have had six or more partners.
Poor and minority adolescent males start having intercourse earlier than more affluent and white teens, according to the Guttmacher report.
The report also found that black men are twice as likely to be infected with herpes as white and Hispanic men. And bacterial STDs, such as chlamydia and gonorrhea, are probably several times more common in black men than in white and Hispanic men.
At the very least, according to the report, all men need information and education about obtaining and using condoms and other birth control methods, pregnancy and childbearing, avoiding STDs and how to discuss these issues with their partners.
The Guttmacher report's findings weren't totally discouraging. Men's role in sex and reproductive health has greatly increased along with condom use, Landry says.
