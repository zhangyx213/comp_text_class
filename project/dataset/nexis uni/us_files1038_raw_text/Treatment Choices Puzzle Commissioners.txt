FORMER DIRECTOR DEFENDS NERVE REPAIR AT LSU, PENILE IMPLANT
TAMPA - Taxpayers picked up the tab for a penile implant.
They also paid for a patient's surgery - in New Orleans.
Add to that bills for vasectomies and tubal ligations.
These are some of the procedures that have Hillsborough County commissioners questioning the management of the county's health plan for the poor. The plan is funded by a half-cent sales tax.
"We can't ignore it anymore," Commissioner Stacey Easterling said. "Where there is smoke, there has got to be fire."
Commissioner Ronda Storms agrees.
"I just can't imagine why we would fly someone to New Orleans," she said.
Cretta Johnson, the social services director at the time these procedures were approved, defended the trip in a memo Oct. 21.
The patient suffered from severe nerve damage, and doctors here said a hospital at Louisiana State University was the only one with equipment for an operation.
Johnson said the plan paid for surgery but not for the plane trip or lodging.
She also defended the penile implant.
"The case was approved by all [health plan] directors after scrupulous review," Johnson wrote. "Approval was given for psychiatric reasons on a young diabetic male."
Plan proponents say that in any health plan as large as Hillsborough's - it will spend $93.4 million this year - some abuses will occur.
But Easterling and Storms say problems are widespread.
"In my view, these are not isolated incidents," Storms said. "And the fact that the plan is spending far, far more than it generates, indicates this isn't isolated."
