9 P.M. (9) BRITNEY AND KEVIN: CHAOTIC -- Ms. Spears and Mr. Federline, left, make good their threat to share their love story with the world, with the help of home videos. In this one-hour season premiere, Ms. Spears is on her 2004 tour and telling her friends about the great guy she's met.

8 P.M. (11) GILMORE GIRLS "A House Is Not a Home." In the season finale, Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Rory (Alexis Bledel), the happiest mother and daughter on television, may finally have a serious disagreement -- when Rory, who is halfway through Yale now, announces her plans for the future. But it's Lorelai's future with Luke (Scott Patterson) that is the big question mark.

8 P.M. (2) THE 40TH ANNUAL ACADEMY OF COUNTRY MUSIC AWARDS -- When a show like this is being broadcast from Las Vegas, country music certainly does seem right citified. Kenny Chesney (who married Rene Zellweger in St. John last week), Alison Krauss, Tim McGraw and Gretchen Wilson are among those with multiple nominations.

8 P.M. (7) MY WIFE AND KIDS -- Season finale. People react differently to the prospect of empty-nest syndrome. Now that the children are practically out of the house, Jay (Tisha Campbell) suggests that Michael (Damon Wayans) have a vasectomy. He's not so enthusiastic.

8 P.M. (ESPN Classic) ESPN25: WHO'S NO. 1 "Most Outrageous Characters." The Top 25 in the world of sports include John McEnroe, Howard Cosell, Tonya Harding (shown in 1994), Dennis Rodman and Mike Tyson.

8:40 P.M. (7) GEORGE LOPEZ -- This season finale is loaded with guest stars: Cesar Rosas, the Los Lobos guitarist; and Daunte Culpepper and Donovan McNabb, the N.F.L. quarterbacks. There's also a big birthday party.

10 P.M. (13) VIETNAM: THE NEXT GENERATION -- Thirty years after the end of the Vietnam War, Sandy Northrop's documentary, on "Independent Lens," visits eight young Vietnamese -- among them a farmer, a voice student, an exporter and an engineer -- for whom that war is ancient history. This postwar generation makes up 80 percent of the country's population.

9:20 P.M. (7) ACCORDING TO JIM "Wedding Bell Blues." In the season finale Dana (Kimberly Williams), Jim's sexy sister-in-law, is getting married. But James Belushi (center, with Ms. Williams and Mitch Rouse) ruins things by accidentally knocking the minister unconscious with a car door.   ANITA GATES
