In a battle over patient privacy and public records, an anti-abortion group wants the 911 transcripts and ambulance reports from the St. Louis Fire Department's emergency calls to the Planned Parenthood clinic in the Central West End.
Deborah Myers of Operation Rescue, based in Wichita, Kan., sued the fire department last year seeking the reports, citing the Missouri Sunshine Law that governs access to public records. The group commonly uses 911 call records on abortion clinics nationwide to look for information that might bolster complaints they file with state health departments.
Myers has requested information on the fire department's service calls to Planned Parenthood on Forest Park Avenue since December 2012. The documents produced by the fire department in response were edited "without providing any actual information as required by law," according to the lawsuit. The case is still pending in St. Louis Circuit Court.
St. Louis city attorneys argue that the information sought by Operation Rescue is protected by federal patient privacy laws and state law preventing the release of information that can be used to identify someone's medical treatment.
Missouri law also prohibits the public release of 911 recordings. The date, time, location and "immediate facts and circumstances" of the emergency call is a public record as part of an incident report generated by police or fire departments.
Winston Calvert, city counselor, said "the Sunshine Law is designed to ensure public access to public information, not to snoop in a stranger's private medical records. It would be a shame if the Sunshine Law was used to obtain private medical information as part of a campaign to intimidate women seeking medical care."
Myers' attorney said patient privacy laws shouldn't apply in the case.
"She is not seeking medical records, nor is she seeking any records from Planned Parenthood," said Natalie Decker of Arizona-based Alliance Defending Freedom.
Protesters with Operation Rescue and other groups have documented 25 occasions when ambulances were called to Planned Parenthood in St. Louis since 2009.
"These are presumably botched abortions that the patients had to be transported ... as the public we have a right to know," Newman said. "Ultimately we want to see what's going on inside this abortion clinic and bring a better standard of care to women."
Mary Kogut, CEO of Planned Parenthood St. Louis, said it is inaccurate to speculate that every ambulance visit involves a patient having an abortion.
"We have visitors, we have staff, we have many, many patient visits and many people in our building every year," Kogut said. "When an emergency transfer happens, no one but us and that person knows why."
There were close to 5,000 abortions performed last year at the St. Louis clinic. The procedure typically takes 15 to 30 minutes under local anesthesia. The facility also provides routine medical care to men and women, birth control, cancer screening, sexually transmitted disease testing, vasectomies for men and various educational meetings.
Kogut said she is proud of the staff's ability to recognize when someone needs a higher level of care at a hospital.
"We really are confident about the excellence of our health care and the compassion in which we provide it," she said.
In St. Louis and at clinics nationwide, abortion protesters stand outside and track the ambulances that come in. They then request the 911 calls and incident reports from the local fire departments for each incident. Protesters have also taken photos and video of patients as they are loaded into ambulances. Planned Parenthood staff now use sheets and tarps to shield the patients, Kogut said.
Some of the 911 transcripts Operation Rescue has obtained from abortion clinics in other states have described calls for women with uncontrolled bleeding or perforations in their uterus, said Troy Newman, the group's president. Newman of Operation Rescue said it is unusual for a public agency to block access to the records.
The journalism site ProPublica recently wrote about anti-abortion groups' strategy to seek out public records for information on women who obtain abortions and their doctors. That information can then be used to file complaints against clinics or push for new laws restricting abortion. Complaints from Operation Rescue have prompted unannounced inspections of the Planned Parenthood clinic by the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services.
While Planned Parenthood has 14 clinics across the state, only the St. Louis location offers abortion procedures. A clinic in Columbia recently started providing abortions induced by medication, although it may not be able to do so as of Dec. 1 because of an issue with hospital privileges. The remainder of the approximately 3,000 to 4,000 abortions a year in Missouri are performed in hospitals and outpatient surgery centers.
Abortions have about the same complication rate as colonoscopies, with fewer than one percent resulting in serious injury, according to a 2014 University of California, San Francisco study.
