It is a sad day when our once nationally renowned Minnesota
Department of Health earns the name Ministry of Health Propaganda.
There is no evidence that abortion causes breast cancer. The
National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society, the
National Breast Cancer Coalition, the World Health Organization,
the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the
Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists have each
concluded that abortion does not increase the risk of breast cancer.
The Minnesota Ministry of Health Propaganda says otherwise.
Its pamphlet, "If You Are Pregnant: Information on Fetal
Development, Abortion and Alternatives," asserts, "Findings from
some studies suggest there is an increased risk of breast cancer
among women who had an abortion, while findings from other studies
suggest there is no increased risk. This issue may need further study."
The misrepresentation that there is a scientific controversy
where there is, in fact, a consensus is not an effort to inform a
woman making a difficult decision about abortion.
It is an effort to inject prestigious and frightening content
into the process of informed consent. It is an effort to deceive
her and dissuade her from that choice.
The potential scope of this political intrusion into
physician-patient communication is only defined by the limits of
political power.
The same process would equally well justify anticontraceptive
groups promoting the view promulgated by the U.S. Conference of
Catholic Bishops that the medical side effects and disadvantages of
vasectomy include: "Increased risk of prostate cancer described in
2 studies: also increase in lung cancer if surgery was over 20
years ago."
The political corruption of the integrity of information from the
Health Department should not be obscured by some argument that they
are simply exercising their right of free speech.
Anybody can say anything they want. It is the tragedy of our time
that lies, misrepresentations and distortions are accepted weapons
for public political combat. However, the tactical misuse of
once-prestigious bodies to introduce unscientific distortions into
the privacy of the physician-patient conversation interferes with
the process of informed consent.
This precedent endangers us all.
