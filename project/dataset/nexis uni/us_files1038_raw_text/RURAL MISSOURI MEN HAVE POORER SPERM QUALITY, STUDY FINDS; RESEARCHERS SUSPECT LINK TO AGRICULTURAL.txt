Sperm quality in rural Missouri men is significantly lower than for men in large U.S. cities, a study led by the University of Missouri has found. And researchers are speculating that exposure to agricultural chemicals may explain the difference.
The study is one of only a few that looks at geographical factors affecting sperm count and motility. For the first time, it suggests that environmental factors may cause fertile men in rural areas to have lower sperm counts and less active sperm than men in urban areas.
"It's a message that this is something we need to look at more carefully," said the University of Missouri's Dr. Shanna H. Swan, who led the study. "If we find something that alters sperm count, it's probably not acting in isolation." Swan is an epidemiologist and professor of family and community medicine at the university.
The study is published in today's online edition of Environmental Health Perspectives. (The article can be found at ). It evaluated semen samples from the partners of 512 pregnant women in Columbia, Mo., Minneapolis, New York and Los Angeles. The study includes 176 rural Missouri men.
In the Missouri samples, the mean sperm concentration was about 59 million sperm per milliliter - far below samples from the three urban cities studied. Semen quality - measured by the count, shape and motility of sperm - was equally high in Minneapolis and New York and slightly lower in Los Angeles. Sperm concentration was about 103 million in New York, 99 million in Minneapolis and 81 million in Los Angeles.
Sperm concentration of 20 million sperm per milliliter is cause for concern, Swan said. And recent studies suggest the probability of getting pregnant goes down with concentrations fewer than 40 million per milliliter.
"For some reason, semen quality studies are always controversial," Swan said. "I'm sure there will be a lot of discussion about it."
More than 50 percent of the land in Boone County, where the Missouri samples were taken, is used for farming. From 0 percent to 19 percent of the land in the other test sites is used for farming, Swan said.
Until now, most studies were conducted in large cities and examined select groups of men, such as pre-vasectomy patients, infertility patients and sperm donors, Swan said. A previous study in Iowa City, Iowa, also found lower sperm concentration. The researchers are currently studying semen quality in Iowa City, where men face higher exposure to agricultural chemicals than in Columbia.
"We weren't asking the right question," Swan said. "What people are really concerned about is whether factors in the environment were affecting (sperm quality)."
Other environmental factors that may alter the quality of semen include ozone levels and plasticizers found in household chemicals, Swan said.
The researchers controlled for other factors that could affect sperm quality, such as age, smoking and recent fever.
But it's too early to say if men in rural Missouri should be concerned, Swan said. Scientists have found only a correlation between sperm quality and geography.
"At this point, we definitely don't want to alarm anybody," she said. "It's the first study to show this in humans, although there is animal data. Obviously it has to be replicated. We don't even know the route of exposure."
Swan said she hoped to have results in four to six months on agricultural chemicals found in urine samples to test the hypothesis that contaminated air or water may affect sperm quality.
"It's likely that if these chemicals are affecting male performance, they're probably affecting women," she said.
This research is part of the ongoing Study for Future Families, funded by the National Institutes of Health, to find out why some couples are having problems getting pregnant. Also participating in the research were the University of Minnesota, the University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center, the University of California at Davis and Mount Sinai School of Medicine.
