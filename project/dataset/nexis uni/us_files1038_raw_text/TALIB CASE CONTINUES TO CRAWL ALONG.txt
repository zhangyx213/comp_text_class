MAKING NEWS
It appears Aqib Talib's shooting case will drag on through the summer. The Bucs cornerback's attorney, Frank Perez, met with prosecutors Thursday, and another hearing is scheduled for June 30. Talib, 25, was indicted on assault with a deadly weapon in connection with a shooting in Garland, Texas, on March 21. No trial date has been set. "We are still discussing the case,'' Perez said in a text message to the St. Petersburg Times. Apart from the legal ramifications - if the case goes to trial and Talib is convicted of the felony, he could face up to 20 years in prison - the cornerback could face NFL sanctions once the lockout ends. Commissioner Roger Goodell has said players who violate the league's personal conduct policy during the lockout could be disciplined when it's over. Players want lockout amnesty.

Wuerffel optimistic about recovery
Former UF Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Danny Wuerffel, being treated for Guillain-Barre syndrome, says he expects to recover from the most serious aspects of the disease and could be back doing ministry work in a month. Guillain-Barre is a disorder in which the body's immune system attacks the nerves in response to an infectious illness. It can cause paralysis. Wuerffel, 37, tells the New York Times he can stand but his legs are weak and he has persistent headaches. The 1996 Heisman winner says he has received many phone calls, e-mails and text messages of support. He has heard from his UF coach, Steve Spurrier, as well as ex-Gators coach Urban Meyer and current coach Will Muschamp. "It reminds me of when I was playing and people were cheering and pulling for you," he says.
