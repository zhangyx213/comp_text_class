Officials of Guerrero State have agreed to pay $3,400 each to 14 indigenous men who were coerced into having vasectomies a decade ago. The men will also get water storage tanks and cement to build new homes, Luis Barrera Rios, the state health secretary, told The Associated Press. During a visit to the village of El Camalote in 1998, health workers demanded that men with more than four children be sterilized, the National Human Rights Commission said last year in a report. The men said state workers had promised them new homes and scholarships for their children if they underwent the procedure.
