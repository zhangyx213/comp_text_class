Over 200 minor league baseball players were cut Friday and more than 400 have been released over the past month according to transactions posted at MiLB.com.
The cuts have been in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the very real possibility that there will be no minor league seasons this summer.
Minor league players not on 40-man rosters were promised $400 per week through May 31 by a policy drafted by MLB. The Pirates Saturday became the 16th team to extend those allowances through at least the end of June. Oakland is the only club known to be ending its stipends at the end of May.
The Pirates also are one of the teams that has not cut any players, though sources told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that moves still are being contemplated. If the Pirates do release a player, which more than likely will happen before the end of June, he still will be paid through the end of the month while receiving full medical benefits.
Lower-level players were hit hardest by cuts, with at least 172 players released from the rookie-level Gulf Coast, Arizona and Dominican Summer Leagues.
Astros
Many fans anticipated raining boos down on Houston in the 2020 season, but with the coronavirus bringing baseball to a halt, one brewery is taking the sign-stealing shaming to another level. Departed Soles, a brewery in Jersey City, N.J., introduced a new beer called Trash Can Banger, featuring a can with the Astros retro red, orange and yellow-striped colors from the late 1970s. Owner and head brewer Brian Kulbacki and his staff came up with the concept while trying to think of creative ideas to keep business going during the pandemic.
Elsewhere
The Pawtucket Red Sox are going from "Play Ball" to "Bon Appetit." With the minor league baseball season on hold due to the pandemic, the Class AAA affiliate of Boston has found another use for its home field. Starting next weekend, "Dining on the Diamond" will allow PawSox fans and others just longing for a taste of baseball to sample typical ballpark fare on the McCoy Stadium infield in Rhode Island. "For a baseball romantic, this is the best restaurant in the world," team president Charles Steinberg said. Minor league ballparks have long been a laboratory for some of the wackiest promotions in sports, giving away everything from toilet seat cushions to vasectomies to funerals. Other teams have rented out their stadiums on Airbnb and high school graduations.
