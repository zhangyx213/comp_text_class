Ken Bone is learning what it's like to be famous.
The Shiloh man, who became an internet sensation after asking a question of the candidates while wearing a bright red sweater during Sunday's presidential debate, answered questions of his own on the Reddit social media site late Thursday and early Friday.
Bone included his Reddit username in a Twitter post announcing the session. So those who looked up the name found Bone has in the past shared his thoughts on everything from images of a pregnant woman in a bikini to the increased "sexual satisfaction" he found after undergoing a vasectomy.
In another post, he commented that the controversial 2012 killing of Florida teen Trayvon Martin was justified, but also expressed contempt for the shooter, George Zimmerman.
Bone was at the Normandie Golf Club on Friday to help the fundraising efforts of local charity 3 Little Birds 4 Life, an organization that helps grant the wishes of young adults with cancer.
On Thursday, Bone announced the launching of Uber Select in St. Louis.
Film crews from New York and the San Francisco-based company Bodega Studios were filming Bone at the golf course Friday for a documentary.
He said he realized that some of his comments were not well thought out.
Bone explained his comment about Martin.
He also apologized to people who thought his comments were insulting.
"I'm just a dude, that's my whole thing," he said. "I'm just a guy. Sometimes I say things I shouldn't say, but I'm trying to keep it overall positive and just get people out involved in the process of politics."
