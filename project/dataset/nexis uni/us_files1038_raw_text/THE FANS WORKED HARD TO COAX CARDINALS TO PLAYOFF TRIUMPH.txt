* Coming up with believable excuses to miss work can stoke creative juices.
Postseason play obviously means more hard work and added pressure for Cardinals ballplayers. Less obvious is the hard work and pressure this puts upon their fans.
There are the nights spent camping out in line for tickets, the hours devoted to dressing for Cardinals success and the excuses crafted to attend day games. Tuesday's 7-5 Cards victory against the Atlanta Braves began at noon, and Thursday's game starts at 3 p.m.
"I told my boss I'm having a vasectomy," joked John Bassett, a sales manager for a printing company. "Of course I'll be recovering from it on Thursday because I have tickets to that game too."
Bassett's wife, Sue, a systems analyst, said she worked from 6 to 10 a.m. before putting out a computer message telling her office that she'd be gone for the afternoon. Did she tell them the reason why?
"I wrote 'Go Cards' at the end of the message so I think they got the idea," she added. "But I waited until I left the building before changing into my shorts."
Matt Siemer paraded around Busch Stadium wearing a placard that read: "We quit our jobs to be here today." The "we" referred to Seimer and his pal, Travis Perry, both 23 years old.
"The truth is we were going to quit anyway," said Seimer, who worked in marketing for the Memphis Redbirds, the Cardinals Class AAA ballclub. Perry held a similar job with the West Tennessee Diamond Jaxx, a Class AA affiliate of the Chicago Cubs.
"But no, we wouldn't have automatically gotten the day off. There are no days off in minor league baseball."
Judging from most of the answers, St. Louis is filled with kind-hearted bosses - or Busch Stadium was filled with employees of the kind-hearted ones. Many fans said they asked for permission to take the day off and they got it. Sometimes they got more.
Harriet Wilberg and three co-workers at Osage Industries in Linn, Mo., came to the game with tickets they had won in a lottery at the plant, and in a van the boss popped for. Linn is about 100 miles west of St. Louis.
 
Some bosses, in fact, gave themselves the day off.
"I looked in the mirror and said, 'Mirror, can I go to the ball game?'" said Phil Courtney, who owns a heating-and-cooling business in St. Louis. "The mirror said, 'Take the day off.' "
That line of thinking trickled down to thousands of students playing hooky to attend the game. Elizabeth Koballa, an eighth-grader at Hixson Middle School in Webster Groves, said she had received her standing-room ticket at the last minute, as a 13th birthday present from a family friend. She wasn't concerned about missing school; after all, it was only one day.
"She's a very good student and a real whiz at sports statistics," said the friend, Susan Skinner. "We look at it not like she's missing school but more like she's getting a math and social studies lesson. The Cardinals, after all, are making history here."
For many Cardinals fans, postseason play began long before game time. By 8:30 a.m., hundreds had arrived at Kiener Plaza in full red regalia to sing, dance and listen to Cardinals luminaries such as broadcaster Jack Buck and catcher Mike Matheny.
Matheny, who is out for the season with a hand injury, told the faithful that his teammates fought hard during the regular season for home field advantage because "we knew what an impact you fans would make."
Sister Jean Patrick Ehrhardt, a Dominican nun stationed in Granite City with Holy Family Convent, watched the rally wearing a black habit and a Mark McGwire jersey over a white skirt and turtle neck.
"This jersey belonged to my friend, Peggy Morrison," she explained. "She had season tickets and would take me to almost all the games.
"Peggy passed away the Saturday before the season opened. I try to wear it to all the games so that Peggy is with me."
Marty Prather, a season ticket holder from Springfield, Mo., said he and his wife had left at 3:30 a.m. to make it to the rally on time. Actually, he came to the rally while his wife, Karin, held a place in line at the stadium so that they could be the first ones inside when the gates opened at 10 a.m. The two had nearly a dozen giant placards and banners to display during the game.
Prather explained that he owns a Domino's pizza franchise with eight stores, and yes, Monday was plenty busy because of the Rams' victory the day before.
"I earned the day off," said Prather, who extended the same courtesy - and Cardinals tickets - to four of his managers. "If we make it to the next round of play, we'll take care of the other four managers."
Then he corrected himself: "I mean when we go all the way. That's my theory in life, if you're going to go, it might as well be all the way."
The getting there could be rocky. The game itself was a strange mix of Little League foolishness, solid baseball and a nerve-wracking finish. Inebriated by the Braves' collapse in the first inning, fans sobered up quickly when 21-year-old pitcher Rick Ankiel lost his grip. He gave up four runs in the third inning and threw five wild pitches, setting a record for most wild pitches in an inning in what baseball considers its modern era, the period since 1900.
The entrance of Braves reliever John Rocker in the eighth inning fired the crowd up again, with those reprobates in the bleachers leading the way. They're the ones who started the chants of "Rocker, Rocker," and the mock chops that spread through the seats.
 
Of course, the ninth had to bring trouble.
"I hate to hark back to the Whitey days, but when Bruce Sutter came out, everybody knew we were OK," said Terry Knies, a computer network administrator downtown. "Dave Veres got the job done, but he takes it to the edge too often."
The game fell off the edge the Cardinals' way. Season-ticket holder Kathleen Albrecht stood in the breezeway behind Section 266 and dared anybody in the happily departing crowd to avoid her high-fives.
"A great game, a fabulous game," she said. "I wasn't afraid at all. After Ankiel fell apart, the rest of the team came together. That's how they've been all year - and why we're here today."
