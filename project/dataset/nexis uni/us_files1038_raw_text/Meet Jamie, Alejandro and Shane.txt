Nick Lachey and Charlie Sheen aren't the only guys grabbing headlines in the celebrity universe.
USA TODAY's William Keck reveals three of the most famous international male celebrities you've probably never heard of:
Jamie Theakston
Great Britain
"Jamie has been the center of some huge scandals," says Ruth Hilton of the UK's OK! magazine. Like America's Paul "Pee-Wee Herman" Reubens, the  6-foot-4,  35-year-old former model started out as a beloved children's TV show host before getting caught in a compromising situation.
In 2002, after splitting with Nip/Tuck's Joely Richardson, Theakston turned up in a sex parlor  "and he got caught," Hilton says. "It was the most fantastic story; everyone was shocked. It made it impossible to put him back on kids TV, and it could have killed his career." But after publicly apologizing for the indiscretion,  "he's now back hosting quiz shows and such."
In Britain, "we laugh at our celebrities and are perfectly willing to forgive them," Hilton says.
Shane Warne
Australia
"Shane is one of the greatest cricket players in history," says Claire Isaac of OK!'s Australia edition. But Warne, 36,  has been at the center of scandal.
In 1999, he signed a deal to promote Nicorette, the stop-smoking gum, which dropped him when he was photographed  with a cigarette. In 2003, Warne tested positive for diuretics, which can mask the use of steroids, and was suspended from his sport for a year. He made recent tabloid reports when a video was released showing him with two scantily clad women playing with a sex toy.
Meanwhile, he used his time off from cricket to break into TV. Warne has been on Australia's Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and this year was on the soap opera Neighbours.
Alejandro Fernandez
Mexico
As the son of legendary Mexican ranchera musician  Vicente Fernandez, Alejandro was born into fame and became known as El Potrillo, or "runt of the litter." But Fernandez, 35, grew up to be a strapping, sexy singer -- "one of the biggest singers in the Spanish world," says Richard Perez-Feria, editor of People en Espanol.
What makes Fernandez a cover boy is his reputation with the ladies. "He's a notorious playboy who has had five kids by two wives," Perez-Feria says. "When Paris Hilton travels to Mexico, she wants to hang with him."
Divorced for the second time, Fernandez, who calls himself a "charro" (Mexican cowboy) and "metrosexual," made headlines in 2004 by announcing that he had a vasectomy. He has toured  the USA and is shooting his first American film, Gold on Eagle Street, directed by Alfonso Arau (A Walk in the Clouds).
