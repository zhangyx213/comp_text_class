Women do not have a right to "free" birth control just as I have no right to a "free" vasectomy. Nothing is free. Things are always paid for at somebody's expense.
The Affordable Care Act tells that same somebody to cover the cost of - for them - a religiously objectionable practice. Women can pay for birth control themselves or can opt to work for employers who cover birth control without a constitutional religious objection.
More to follow as Rep. Nancy Pelosi's prognostication "we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what's in it" comes to fruition. The devil's in the details.
