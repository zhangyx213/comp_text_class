Many of the words in our language are derived from ancient Latin. My research shows that AT&T's More Bars came from the Latin expression: Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha.
Hey, Mayor Franklin, go visit San Diego or even Greenville, S.C., to see what a safe and popular downtown area should look like.
After eight years of a Republican president in the '80s, we had the S&L crisis. About 20 years later, same thing. Coincidence?
It's pretty clear that Barack Obama will be twice as good a president as John McCain could ever be. We can only hope that Obama will be at least half as good a president as Hillary Clinton would have been.
Mortgage crisis? Look at the Clinton administration's pushing of subprime mortgages --- and we find the cause.
If it is a good idea to have a minimum wage for workers, it is even a better idea to have a maximum wage for their bosses who grab most of the company's profits for themselves. Stockholders would be better off, too.
I guess those banks should not have given all those loans to people who couldn't afford them. We obviously have to blame the banks, because the people that agree to these loans do not seem very intelligent. What did their parents teach them?
If you think subdivision stop signs are merely a suggestion, you just might be a moron.
Would someone please feed Victoria Beckham?
You do know --- right? --- that if you are earning less than $250,000 a year, Barack Obama will give you a tax cut three times the size of what John McCain is proposing.
My husband and I worked very hard over the last 25 years for the life we now live --- two cars, a house and a child out of college without debts. We don't appreciate Obama and Biden wanting to penalize us with more taxes because we've succeeded to an extent and live what is left of the American dream!
John McCain, you can't change Washington. You have been there 26 years. You are part of the problem, and the problem is that Republicans have been in the White House all but eight of those years.
I love how Obama says McCain is out of touch with Americans when he claimed $4.2 million income last year.
Are you kidding me? You think being a Harvard grad is qualification enough for president? I'd rather have someone who knows how the country works and how to defend it!
If it's one's patriotic duty to serve in Iraq, then it's everyone else's patriotic duty to pay for it. Which type of patriot are you?
You know, I mean I was like wondering why we don't like, you know, teach like, proper English in our like, you know, homes and like, public school anymore, you know?
Hey Blue Cross/Blue Shield, thanks for sending the informative "Future Moms" flier --- you do know you paid for my husband's vasectomy, right?
