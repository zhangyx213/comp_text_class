On the Friday before this month's primary, I went to the county election board to cast an absentee ballot. I handed the clerk my drivers license.
"Which party?" she asked.
"If the Socialists don't have any contested races, give me a Democratic ballot," I said.
"Same thing," she said.
Actually, that is not the way it happened. I told the clerk I wanted to vote in the Democratic primary. Without comment, she gave me a Democratic ballot.
Oh, such choices!
Lacy Clay or Russ Carnahan? That's like asking a hungry man if he prefers steak or lobster.
But the race I was most interested in was in the Missouri House 87th District.
Susan Carlson and Stacey Newman were incumbents thrown together because of redistricting. Both are very liberal. Each was endorsed by people I admire.
From a philosophical point of view, I couldn't go wrong with either of them.
Newman used to represent the 73rd District. That was my district. I remember when she ran in the 2008 primary. I met her at a friend's house and I liked her, but I voted for her opponent, Steve Brown. He seemed more substantial.
He won and served briefly - without distinction - until he pleaded guilty to felony obstruction of justice for his role in shenanigans involving Jeff Smith's unsuccessful campaign for Congress. Brown is probably best remembered as the guy who secretly wore a wire to help the feds catch his friend.
He agreed to do so after the feds confronted him with tapes of telephone conversations secretly record by Skip Ohlsen, then a Democractic operative and now an accused bomber.
How could anybody not be a Democrat?
After Brown resigned, Newman won a special election to complete his term.
She did a splendid job. She received national attention when she introduced a bill to regulate vasectomies. The bill would have prohibited the procedure unless it was performed to prevent death or avert serious risk of physical impairment.
Some might say the bill was part of the Democratic Party's War on Men, but I supported Newman's effort. I say that as a newspaper columnist, if not as a man.
So I was inclined to vote for Newman over Carlson, anyway.
Then I began receiving negative mailings from Carlson. Newman was against clean air. Or maybe she was against clean water. Whatever she was against, the mailings bothered me.
If there is one thing that scares me, it's a mean liberal woman.
Call me sentimental, but I sometimes break out in song, "I love the flower girl..." The Cowsills recorded that classic in 1967. Its meaningful lyrics have stuck with me for years. "I knew, I knew, I knew, I knew. She could make me happy, happy, happy."
So that is my ideal woman, sitting in the rain, not seeming to care, a smile on her face. Such a woman would not send out negative mailings.
As if I needed further incentive to vote for Newman, my good friend Ray Hartmann was her campaign treasurer.
I not only decided to vote for Newman, I asked a friend to do so. We were talking about the great options liberals in our neighborhood had in this primary - how could you go wrong? - and I said, "Jim, vote for Newman." He shrugged and said he would.
Because I would be in Michigan on election day, I voted absentee. Then I went on vacation with my family.
Somebody brought a computer, A couple of days after the election, I looked up the results. Newman had won by a single vote.
I was responsible for two votes. The tying and the winning votes.
"We own a legislator!" I shouted.
Everybody cheered, and then somebody asked, "What can we do with a legislator?"
That was a good question. Or to put it more succinctly, what could a legislator do for us? Especially when she's a liberal in a very conservative General Assembly. It's not as if she could get a bill passed.
What's the point of owning a liberal legislator in Missouri?
Maybe it's like owning a Rolex watch. The whole point of owning one is to own one.
Sadly, my ownership of a legislator was short-lived. It turns out some people had been given the wrong ballots - they looked at the names and didn't realize that they had the wrong ballots? - and Judge Michael Jamison has ordered a new election.
Come on, Judge! If they didn't know they had the wrong ballots, maybe their votes ought not count, anyway.
Oh well. In the back of my mind, I knew it was too good to be true. I knew, I knew, I knew, I knew.
