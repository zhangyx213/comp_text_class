There are certain stories that tear at the human heart. Tales of great heroism, about soul-crushing adversity faced and conquered, about horrific wars survived. 
So it is with Spelling It Like It Is, a new memoir by Hollywood princess turned reality TV pauper Tori Spelling. 
The daughter of Aaron Spelling, who was worth $600 mil, is virtually on Skid Row, she writes in the book. Yes, it's as dire as that, Tori tells People: She hasn't "bought a purse in three years," her four children are forced to wear hand-me-downs (oh, the shame!), and her husband Dean McDermott, 46, can't afford a vasectomy. Tori is unemployed: her reality show, Tori & Dean: Home Sweet Hollywood, was canceled last year. "So we have to be more restrictive of what we can spend," she says. 
"I grew up rich beyond anyone's dreams," she says. "Even when I try to embrace a simpler lifestyle, I can't seem to let go of my expensive tastes." 
  Coupling & uncoupling
Kim and Kanye made their first appearance as an engaged couple Thursday night at the inaugural Dream for Future Africa Foundation Gala at Spago Beverly Hills, to rub egos with (oh, the frisson, the frisson!) Quincy Jones, Rachel Zoe, Dita Von Teese, and Babyface, says USA Today. 
  The beautiful
Orlando Bloom, 36, and his beautiful wife, Miranda Kerr, 30, who have been together six years and tied the knot in July 2010, have announced that they intend to divorce. They have a 2-year-old son, Flynn Christopher Blanchard Copeland Bloom.
