Please forgive This Just In if today’s peace is littered with factual errors, typoses, poor word usage, sentence structure and/or misspelled names.
But it’s very difficult to call sources, interview sources, spell check, fact check AND keep track of your NCAA Tournament bracket while channel surfing CBS, TNT, TBS, falseTV and ESPNU (gotta get your NIT fix).
Now we’ve all read about companies losing gazillions of dollars in work productivity during the Tournament. There’s a simple solution. The first two days should be declared national holidays. Just drop a couple minor holidays like Labor Day or Memorial Day and replace them with Tournament Days.
One other tournament nugget: USA Today reports there’s a rise in vasectomies the first Thursday and Friday of the tournament. Guess here is that the sale of frozen peas also skyrocket.
Bryant (not Kobe) rocks
Look up any 2013 mock baseball draft and USD third baseman Kris Bryant is near the top of the list. Bryant is expected to be gone no later than the 10th pick. …
If the 6-foot-5, 215-pound slugger out of Las Vegas keeps smashing baseballs into the dark night at Fowler Park, the Houston Astros will be tempted to invest millions in Bryant with the No. 1 pick.
Bryant’s numbers the past nine games: 14-for-31 (.452), nine home runs, 17 RBIs, 18 runs scored. … Going into this weekend’s series at Gonzaga, Bryant leads the nation with 12 homers in 20 games. …
USD coach Rich Hill, in Baseball America, on Bryant: “Every once in a while you have a player like this in college baseball — just a guy who can dominate the college game. The only time I can remember seeing anything like this is Troy Glaus.”
This/that
For you newbies to San Diego, Glaus (320 major league home runs) played at Carlsbad High. … And in 1994 was a second-round pick by the Padres out of Carlsbad. … Padres didn’t offer enough coin, so Glaus opted for UCLA before starring with the Angels. …
Jim Rome said San Diego State was opening the NCAA Tournament on Thursday against Michigan. Jimmie, Jimmie, Jimmie. That was South Dakota State University. …
Could someone please explain why Darren Smith of The Mighty 1090 does not have a drive-time show? ...
When someone’s boring you with a round-by-round breakdown of their bracket, raise a palm and say, “Do you want a stroke-by-stroke account of my last golf game? Didn’t think so. Nor do I give a rip about your bracket.” …
For you Women’s NIT buffs, USD and San Diego State would meet in the quarterfinals. ... Apologies if you penciled Gonzaga in your Final Four. Zags will exit long before Atlanta. ... Guests on Saturday’s U-T TV Prep Sports include La Jolla Country Day tennis player Jack Murphy and U-T staff writer Dennis Lin. … Lin will discuss the Jan. 6 murder of Brawley High football and baseball player Martin Garza, focusing on the reaction of his closest friends. Lin’s story will be featured in Sunday’s U-T. The show airs 11 a.m. to noon on Cox Cable (Ch. 114) and AT&T U-Verse (17), plus utsandiego.com.
The Arts
TJI’s reading “The Confession” by John Grisham. It’s a second read and every bit as good as the first time through. …
A black teenage football star in Texas is wrongly accused of murdering a white cheerleader. After being badgered by lying investigators for more than 15 hours, the teenager confesses to killing the girl. Eventually, the truth surfaces. … The heroes, and villains, are many. …
A friend in Texas highly recommends Dan Jenkins’ “Fairways and Greens.” … Based on past reads, anything by Jenkins is uproariously funny … Jenkins’ daughter, Sally, wrote “It’s Not About The Bike.” … Maybe because she earned millions with Lance Armstrong, Sally still speaks highly of the cyclist.
