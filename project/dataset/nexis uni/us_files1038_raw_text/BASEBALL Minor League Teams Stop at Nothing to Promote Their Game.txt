In minor league baseball, where the goal of most players is promotion to the majors, the goal of some owners appears to be promotion to the extreme.
     One such outlandish promotion was held last night in Charleston, S.C., where fans were barred from the ballpark until the fifth inning during "Nobody Night." 
 Another strange promotion is scheduled for July 18 in Portland, Ore., where fans will be invited to shred documents during "Arthur Andersen Appreciation Night."
In Charleston last night, no fans were allowed to attend the Charleston Riverdogs' game against the Columbus Redstixx at Joe Riley Stadium until the game became official in the bottom of the fifth. Until then, hundreds of fans were gathered outside the main gate and the actual game attendance was recorded as zero, which, according to the team, set an attendance low for a professional baseball game.
The Red Stixx won, 4-2. All the runs were scored before fans were allowed to enter the park, and as soon as they were, children scoured the stands for unclaimed foul balls.
Community cooperation was the key, according to Mike Veeck, the owner of the Riverdogs, a Class A affiliate of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
Veeck, whose father sent a midget to bat for the St. Louis Browns in the majors a half-century ago, has a genealogy and history of outlandish promotions, including "Vasectomy Night" -- canceled at the last minute -- and "Tonya Harding Bat Day."
Everybody except employees, scouts and reporters was barred from entering the stadium. But some fans stood on ladders peeking over the fence.
Stephen Parker, 50, and Ute Appleby, 47, plopped beach chairs behind the center-field wall and peered through an opening. "I've had much worse seats at Yankee Stadium," said Parker, who recently moved to Charleston after living in New York for 25 years.
In Portland next week, the Beavers, the Class AAA affiliate of the San Diego Padres, will sponsor "Arthur Andersen Appreciation Night" to poke fun at the accounting firm convicted of obstruction of justice last month for shredding and altering documents related to an investigation into energy trading company Enron's complex accounting practices.
At the game against Edmonton, anyone named Arthur or Andersen will receive free admission. And the first person named Arthur Andersen will get a gift package that includes a party inside a luxury suite for 80 friends.
Fans are encouraged to take old documents to be destroyed at several shredding stations throughout the park. The team also will tuck away certificates for a game of "massive debt hide-and-go-seek."
Portland plays at PGE Park, which is named for Portland General Electric, a utility owned by Enron. "There's no irony there," Beavers General Manager Mark Schuster said. "We would have gone ahead with this promotion no matter where we played."
The Veeck-promoted Nobody Night came five days after the Charleston team set an attendance record of 7,885 on July 4.
Veeck's mother was in town but said she would not attend Nobody Night. "She lived with a fairly crazy guy for a lot of years," Veeck said, of his father. "She looked at me this morning over coffee and said: 'Bill would've loved this. You spend your whole life figuring out ways to draw 'em in and now you're keeping 'em out.' "
