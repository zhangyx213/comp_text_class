Nobody -- not even the die-hard fans -- will be allowed to watch the Charleston Riverdogs' game against the Columbus Redstixx tonight in Charleston, S.C. And that's just what the team wants. The Riverdogs will continue their tradition of outlandish promotions when they padlock the gates and hold a party, including discounted food and beer, outside the ballpark in an attempt to set the record for the lowest attendance at a professional baseball game on "Nobody Night." The idea has been called ridiculous, and team owner and promotional guru Mike Veeck says that's the point. 
Veeck has a long history of outlandish promotions, including "Vasectomy Night" -- canceled at the last minute -- and "Tonya Harding Bat Day." Radio play-by-play announcer Jim Lucas says the attendance record is 12 people who braved a rainstorm to see Chicago defeat Troy on Sept. 17, 1881. Veeck's father, Bill, was the mastermind behind the Chicago White Sox's notorious Disco Demolition Night in 1979, where fans burned disco records in the outfield of Comiskey Park and started a riot. Bill Veeck also once sent a midget to bat in the major leagues. No felony, just a misdemeanor For the second time in six years, the men's final at Wimbledon was interrupted by a naked prankster cavorting on Centre Court. In 1996, a young woman wearing only a tiny apron dashed across the court just before the match between Richard Krajicek and MaliVai Washington. Yesterday, it was a 37-year-old man -- a self-described "serial streaker" -- who enlivened the proceedings during a rain break in Lleyton Hewitt's three-set victory over David Nalbandian. With Hewitt leading 6-1, 1-0, the man jumped onto the court, shed all of his clothes, kicked off his shoes and did a little dance at the net.
As spectators laughed and cheered, he did a pirouette, bowed, flipped over the net and flexed his muscles. It took about two minutes before security officials reacted.
The man hopped over the net to evade two male guards before he was finally caught from behind by a female guard and escorted away with a red sheet around him. Police identified the man as Mark Roberts of Liverpool.
Roberts also streaked during a doubles match involving Anna Kournikova on Court 14 two years ago. Roberts, who boasts of 150 streaking "performances" during an eight-year career, was taken to Wimbledon police station for questioning. Check that prenup Mike Bianchi, Orlando Sentinel, on Jeff Gordon's NASCAR slump being attributed to his impending divorce and his wife threatening to take their $10 million Palm Beach mansion: "Kind of reminds you of the quote from Zsa Zsa Gabor: `I'm a marvelous housekeeper.
Every time I leave a man, I keep his house.' " Why Mike? Jimmy Jackson of the Miami Heat married entertainment manager Shawnee Simms in front of 500 guests at the Wieuca Road Baptist Church in Buckhead, Ga. The bride was given away by boxer Mike Tyson -- of all people. Parting skinny Scott Ostler, San Francisco Chronicle: "If baseball ever tests for steroids, they won't even bother with (Tsuyoshi) Shinjo."
