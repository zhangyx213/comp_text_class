Saturday 8 p.m. Capitol Theatre, 405 Cleveland St., Clearwater. $30.50-54.50. (727) 791-7400.
Ottmar Liebert was born in Cologne, Germany, has Chinese and Hungarian heritage, and eventually settled in New Mexico when his rock 'n' roll dream finally fizzled out. At age 30, he formed the band Luna Negra, which has helped him become one of the biggest names in instrumental guitar. His "nouveau flamenco" style has largely defined the sound of his nearly 30 studio LPs and earned him almost half a dozen Grammy nominations while helping Liebert rack up nearly three-dozen gold and platinum records in the United States alone. Saturday's show marks the fifth Capitol Theatre appearance for Liebert, and while he's still supporting the same pair of 2014 releases (Barewood, Three-Oh-Five) he promoted at last summer's show, there isn't any evidence to suggest that his fans won't pack the room once again.

Breakdown
With Criminal Instinct, Hardside, Blistered. Three Knee Deep, Hardwired, Society Abuse, Crisis Unit
Saturday 6 p.m. Crowbar, 1812 N 17th St., Ybor City. $20-$25. (813) 241-8600.
You might think that you love your favorite band. That's before you go to a hardcore show and realize that your devotion pales in comparison to the allegiance fans of the genre have forged with their heroes. This show is a prime example of that and finds New York hardcore legends Breakdown reassembling the lineup that played on an infamous '87demo release that fans hold tight to. It'll be interesting to see if any copies of the original cassette (!) show up at the show, but it'll be even more entertaining to watch now grown up devotees gather in the name of a release that probably defined a time period of their youth. Breakdown material leaned hard on metal, so expect a very loose and celebratory vibe at this show.

Betty Who
Sunday 7 p.m. State Theatre, 687 Central Ave., St. Petersburg. $14-$16. (727) 895-3045.
Betty Who puts an informal bow on St. Pete Pride weekend (see pages 28-29) Sunday night when she hits the State Theatre in support of her 2014 album Take Me When You Go. The 23-year-old Aussie recently cut her teeth with a long run opening on Katy Perry's world tour and is fresh off a stop at famed summer music festival Bonnaroo. Her star's been on a quick rise thanks to Take Me's synthy, blissed out lead single Somebody Loves You, plus her uncanny ability to speak frankly about gay fandom and the brutalities of being a female pop star. Who -real name Jessica Newham - is no stranger to Pride activities (as a child she watched Sydney's parade on TV in hopes of seeing her mother, a regular volunteer) and was involved with the Gay-Straight Alliance for her entire school-aged life, so expect a loud and equally supportive crowd for her at this show.

Juicy J
Sunday 8 p.m. The Ritz Ybor, 1503 Seventh Ave., Ybor City. $30-$125. (813) 247-2555.
The end of May was pretty rough for Juicy J as it found the 40-year-old Memphis rapper hospitalized for exhaustion before he could take the stage in San Francisco. His tour - dubbed "the Hustle Continues" - did have to take a break that night, but it fired right back up and hits Ybor City again on Sunday. Juicy - born Jordan Michael Houston - was just on Seventh Avenue in February 2014 (with a date at Jannus Live in St. Pete in between) and is promoting a new mixtape, Blue Dream & Lean 2, and a yet-to-be-released fourth studio LP, THC: The Hustle Continues at this stop, which is the last date on the current run. He's a Grammy-nominated, bonafide hitmaker (you know you've heard Low), the leader of famed Tennessee rap crew Three 6 Mafia and known for giving his all to the crowd, so expect to be wholly entertained no matter how many times you've already seen him.

Vicetone
Sunday 8 p.m. Shephard's Beach Resort, 619 S Gulfview Blvd., Clearwater Beach. $5 and up. (727) 441-6875.
The Dutch have pumped out a who's who of modern EDM stars (Tiesto, Afrojack, Hardwell, Dash Berlin and Armin Van Buuren all probably ring a bell to fans of the genre), and on Sunday more stars from the Netherlands invade our shores when production duo Vicetone wash up at Shephard's. The boys - Ruben Den Boer and Victor Pool -bring a distinct brand of progressive house that's both good enough to please fans of festival main stages (Vicetone has played Ultra and Tomorrowland) as well as the tastes of clubgoers who would rather have their heads thumped by the bass of smaller rooms. New stuff - including Tove Lo collaboration Come Back To Me - showcases Vicetone's aspirations to completely cross over into Top 40 radio, so expect to the full spectrum at this oceanside gig.

Dierks Bentley
With Maddie & Tae, Kip Moore, Canaan Smith
Thursday 7 p.m. MidFlorida Credit Union Amphitheatre, 4802 U.S.301 N, Tampa. $31.25-$56. (813) 740-2446.
Riser is not Dierks Bentley's most popular song by any stretch of the imagination (that distinction probably goes to inappropriate party anthem Drunk on a Plane), but People magazine's Sexiest Man in Country Music has called the down-tempo ballad a "once in a career" tune that puts his hard times and tough climb to pop country stardom in perspective. "I built (the album) around that song," he recently told Billboard.com. The 39-year-old brings that LP to a spot he played in 2013 as an opener for Miranda Lambert, and expect him to be amped to be back on stage after almost a year off the road. He reportedly wrote up to seven songs a week during the downtime (and put nine on tape in the studio), and he's using the new tunes to help him find a theme for his eighth studio full-length. Don't be surprised if Bentley and his band road test a lot of the new stuff, and expect to still get down to setlist mainstays What Was I Thinkin' and 5-1-5-0, too.
