The formal opening of the Elliot Park Lifesciences Building in Minneapolis will be unlike those of most other incubators for young businesses.
     Elliot Park already has an extensive track record of turning out innovations.
     The building's not-for-profit orthopedic biomechanics lab has been a factor in the creation of several big medical advances, from one of the most widely used total knee systems in the '90s to a spinal cage implant that became the basis for one of the state's biggest medical device successes of the past several years - Spine-Tech Inc.
     The incubator, on the edge of the Hennepin County Medical Center campus at 700 10th Av. S., is now also the first such facility in a tax-advantaged, mile-and-a-half long area designated as the Minneapolis Lifesciences Corridor.
   Bounded by Portland and 11th Avs., Lake St. and S. 6th St., the corridor is meant to become the city's answer to the rush to attract and develop young medical and biotechnology companies. Home to 19 health and medical institutions and 61 research and clinical labs, the corridor already has the highest density of medical research and medical services of any comparable urban area in the country, according to its proponents.
      A half-dozen young medical device companies have signed up for space in Elliot Park in the hope that lightning can strike again. Spine-Tech was sold for $595 million just eight years after it was started.
     "It's a unique situation to have bioengineering studies and small businesses that are put basically together under the same roof," said Dr. Richard Kyle, a well-regarded orthopedic surgeon and co-founder of the lab, which was started in 1978.
     It's also a situation that came to be out of necessity, rather than any grand business plan. Allina Health System decided to sell the building in 2003. Motivated to preserve the 11,000-square-foot facility, one of the few independent labs of its kind in the country, Kyle and lab co-founder Dr. Ramon Gustilo led a group that included Bloomington-based United Properties in buying the building for $1.9 million. The deal closed in August.
     "It would have been difficult to reproduce and so expensive. I'm not sure we could have re-created what we already had," Kyle said.
     The orthopedic lab, which started out as part of Hennepin County Medical Center, came out of the surgeons' desire to have a space to develop new techniques and products to advance their science. By the early 1990s, it became self-funded through a combination of royalties from products, grants and other sources.
     The formerly reluctant landlords appear to have a property with a lot of upside. Enough, in fact, that the investor group is considering the development of an additional facility, which would include space for outpatient surgery and for offices of more developed medical companies. Additional investors are being recruited for the project.
     Dave Durenberger, director of operations for the Midwest Orthopaedic Research Foundation, the umbrella organization for the lab and its associated training center, said the facility could be built within three years at a cost of about $15 million. Among the sites that the group is considering is a lot, now owned by Hennepin Faculty Associates, to the southeast of the Elliot Park building.
     The 60,000-square-foot Elliot Park Lifesciences Building - a former nurses dormitory for the now-defunct Swedish Hospital - is a sum of many parts, starting with the lab and learning center that the building's backers think will be a magnet for start-ups.
     Ten companies will share 10,000 square feet in the incubator and have access to the lab for a fee. The remaining space will be offered to more mature medical operations and professionals providing support services, such as lawyers and accountants.
     Durenberger said the incubator is set up to be an "up-and-out," where young companies get relatively inexpensive rent for a year or two before they are asked to move to different space.
     Harlan Jacobs, president of Genesis Business Centers, which has several incubator facilities in Minnesota, said the advantages of Elliot Park were so clear that he bought a share of the building, a first for the company. His job is to recruit companies and operate the incubator, along with raising $2 million in seed capital to be used for companies in the corridor. The money would be invested in increments of $50,000 to $250,000.
     Besides seed money, the incubator and the corridor can offer the added incentives of breaks on sales, property and some other taxes as part of a state's bioscience zone. The city of Minneapolis has also applied for $130 million from the Federal New Markets Tax Credit Program, which provides tax credits for investing in designated community development areas.
     In addition the building is connected to the medical center by tunnel and skyway, making it convenient for possible clinical trials.
     "I've seen a lot of programs around the country, but have never come across [an incubator] on an extended hospital campus, let alone a Level 1 trauma hospital," Jacobs said.
     Companies will be able to pay down part of their rent with warrants. The building investors and the lab would then share in some of the companies' upside potential.
     Although some of the inventions from lab have helped to fund it over the years, the lab had no stake in Spine-Tech.
     "You could say the line broke or maybe we just didn't set the hook," Durenberger said of that fish that got away. "We're going to do it differently."
