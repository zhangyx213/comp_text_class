Body


That was some interview Steven Jackson gave with Yahoo! Sports. Not only did he have the temerity to rip Rams fans for not rallying around his 3-13 team, he also openly discussed a recent colonic experience:
"My hands were covered in sweat, and the (colon therapist) lady comes in and starts talking my ear off. There's this thin hose-type thing that you put up there that shoots water into you and sucks everything out, but I had trouble getting it in, and then it kept coming out. The lady had to come back six different times and put it back in there. It was brutal."
On the other hand, the ordeal did have its benefits.
"I can't believe we're talking about this," he told the writer, Michael Silver. "But I will say this: Once you get it all out of you, your body feels great. You get a boost of energy, and you feel like you can accomplish anything."
Even pass blocking?
IMUS UNDER ATTACK Tipsheet listened to Don Imus on Tuesday, eager to hear him respond to the heat he took for comments about Adam "Don't Call Me Pacman" Jones
Our take? Imus was ripping the practice of racial profiling, not the oft-arrested Jones, with his comments. That was the context. But listeners could have missed the point, since Imus didn't elaborate at the time.
"What people should be outraged about is that they arrest blacks for no reason," Imus said Tuesday. "I mean, there's no reason to arrest this kid six times. Maybe he did something once, but everyone does something once."
Naturally, those who missed the point tied the remarks to his unfortunate comments about the Rutgers women's basketball team - comments that cost him his earlier radio and TV deals.
Jones heard about the controversy but also missed the point. "I'm truly upset about the comments," Jones said. "Obviously Mr. Imus has problems with African-Americans. I'm upset, and I hope the station he works for handles it accordingly. I will pray for him."
At least the I-man has that going for him ...
MYSTERIES OF THE UNIVERSE Questions to ponder while waiting for T.J. Oshie and Patrik Berglund to generate some much-needed offense for the Blues:
- Will Nikolai Lemtyugov join the fun in St. Louis this season?
- Or will he go the way of Konstantin Zakharov and Timofei Shishkanov?
- With Clayton Mortensen throwing well in the Memphis rotation - and with Colby Rasmus pounding the ball - might the Cards soon have their 10th and 11th players make their big-league debut this season?
THE NO-LOVE SHAQ Shaquille O'Neal asked reporters not to make a big deal over his impromptu rap performance Sunday, which included a Kobe Bryant-bashing refrain we can't repeat here.
Of course, there was some build-up to his profane finishing line. Shaq started with "You know how I be, last week, Kobe couldn't do it without me" and mixed in "I'm a horse, Kobe ratted me out, that's why I'm getting divorced ... He said Shaq gave a (woman) a mil. I don't do that 'cause my name's Shaquille. I love 'em, I don't leave 'em. I got a vasectomy, now I can't breed 'em."
That is good stuff, for sure, but the freestyle performance cost Shaq. Maricopa County (Ariz.) Sheriff Joe Arpaio stripped O'Neal of his titles of special deputy/colonel.
"I want his two badges back," Arpaio told The Associated Press on Tuesday. "Because if any one of my deputies did something like this, they're fired. I don't condone this type of racial conduct."
QUIPS 'R' US Here is what some of America's leading sports pundits have been writing:
Steve Rosenbloom, ChicagoSports.com: "James Caan says the NFL killed his TV drama 'Las Vegas' by ordering business partner NBC to move the show from Mondays to Fridays, which is a death sentence for TV shows. Roger Goodell's sanctimonious hucksters don't like gambling references, even though gambling is exactly what made the NFL so popular. Either that or Bill Belichick's charisma."
Norman Chad, syndicated columnist, on a potential World Series match-up: "The Marlins and Rays are children of the 1990s. Before either one of them was in diapers, Roger Clemens had already won three Cy Young Awards, struck out 20 batters in a single game and taken Mindy McCready to Dairy Queen."
