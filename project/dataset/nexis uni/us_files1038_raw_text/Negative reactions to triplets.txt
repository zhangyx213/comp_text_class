Dear Ann Landers: My wife and I have been married for 10 years. We have twin boys who are now 6 years old. I had a vasectomy reversed, and for three years, we tried to conceive another child (without success) and were very discouraged. I was thrilled when the doctor finally told me, "All signals are go."
My wife and I are now expecting triplets. We were both so excited that we told our family members and friends immediately. We were certain they would rejoice with us. We were wrong. The comments went like this: "You are really going to have your hands full," or "I hope you will have plenty of help."
Why are people so mean? What can we say when we get such comments?
- Rejoicing East of the Rockies Dear Rejoicing: These people are not trying to be mean. They are overwhelmed by the thought of handling three newborn babies at the same time and assume you would be, too.
Simply smile and tell them, "We are going to manage just fine. So many of our good friends have volunteered to help during the first few months. We hope you will be among them."
Dear Ann Landers: I am a personal fitness trainer and have a client who has recently "come out" to me. He apparently thought I was gay, and discovered, much to his disappointment, that I am not.
This man is a good friend, and I like him a lot, but he insists on hugging me hello and goodbye. I am not homophobic, but this much touching makes me uncomfortable. How can I let him know without insulting him or damaging the friendship?
- Straight in New York
Dear Straight in N.Y.: Level with the guy. Tell him you want to be a friend, but the hugging and hand-holding makes you uncomfortable.
