Just about everyone loves the girlish gymnasts at the Summer Olympics. Anyone needing a fix between the quadrennial events can have one, slickly packaged, in "Stick It."
Main maker Jessica Bendinger wrote the cheerleaders hit "Bring It On." She brings on an awful load of flirty technique, reliant on MTV cutting and earnest voice-overs by the lead character, then lots of nudgy commentary during the big meet. That character, Hayley Graham, nearly gets swallowed as the movie seems to keep promoting itself.
But Missy Peregrym, the Canadian beauty who has done mostly TV, personalizes the role, that of a rising star who "bailed" out of a world competition. Blame it on internal pressures and overzealous parents, but don't ask for analysis from this jumpy show.
Having kept her muscle tone in street sports that led to mischief, she's ordered by a judge to attend the V.G.A. (Vickerman Gymnastic Academy) in Texas. Her penance is training under coach Burt Vickerman, whose sage advice tends to consist of "Don't push it" or "You're popping your clutch."
Burt is Jeff Bridges, brave as usual. He poses his beefy sag next to the incredibly taut female athletes (some must be body-doubled in the gymnastics), and there is some humor and pathos in it.
It's a likeable bunch, and funny whenever perky pony Joanne (Vanessa Lengies) points her nose to make a point and mangles her remarks (she tells Burt he will have a "cardio-vasectomy" if he goes on the trampoline). Hayley, who is taller than the others, is the needy rebel who takes on Burt as father figure, then leads her mates in surprising tactics at the national meet.
Bendinger's hyper, overloaded approach has a payoff, when the camera simply feasts on the girls in motion. Vast red carpets heighten their skin tones and bright leotards. The camera rises or whirls, with computer editing that seems to invoke playfully the old Busby Berkeley dance numbers.
"Stick It" has a clunky script, a game cast and swell bodies in motion. It would have been better if Bendinger tried to tell it more than sell it.
