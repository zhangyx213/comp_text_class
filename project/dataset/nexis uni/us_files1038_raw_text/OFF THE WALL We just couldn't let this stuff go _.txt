Vasectomy trademark draws NCAA complaint
The NCAA has filed a complaint against a urology practice in Virginia that trademarked the phrase "Vasectomy Mayhem," which the athletic association said was "confusingly similar" to March Madness, its basketball tournament brand, writes Johnny Diaz of The New York Times.
The college athletic association accused the practice, Virginia Urology in Richmond, Va., of trying to affiliate its brand with the popular March Madness tournament, according to a complaint filed to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's appeal board.
In its complaint, the NCAA said its concerns were the "likelihood of confusion" and "dilution by blurring" of its brand. The complaint was filed last month, but gained national attention from news outlets like NBC last week. The NCAA and Virginia Urology also disputed a vasectomy-related trademark in 2016.
"The NCAA objects to other businesses associating themselves with their tournament when they are not one of our corporate champions or partners," Douglas Masters, the Chicago-based lawyer representing the NCAA, said in an interview.
"We want the public to understand that those who market themselves in connection with the tournament are businesses who support the mission of the NCAA and the athletes that it serves," he added.
The urology practice defended its trademark, saying in a statement that while it could not comment "on the specifics of a legal issue," it believed that the trademark was not a source of confusion.
In one ad, a urologist dribbles a basketball and says: "Hey guys, looking for a reason to sit on the couch and watch the games this weekend? We can help with that." A pregnant doctor appears, grabs the basketball, and says: "And your wife will totally be on board with it. We promise."
Trivia question
Happy birthday to former Padres pitcher Kevin Brown, who turns 56 today. In his one season in San Diego, Brown went 18-7. What was his career high for victories?
They said it
From Dwight Perry of The Seattle Times: "The Mariners produced four straight ties in spring-training games March 3-6 - 8-8 against the Cubs, 9-9 against the Rockies, 2-2 against the White Sox and 1-1 against the A's. And just in case baseball's rules makers go getting any more bright ideas, M's players are suddenly practicing penalty kicks."
From blogger Patti Dawn Swansson, on the remarkably intact, first-century chariot unearthed in Italy: "Although they don't know what to make of the Tom Brady rookie card stuck in the spokes."
From Mike Hart of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, on the Russell Wilson-to-Chicago rumblings: "Bears general manager Ryan Pace, who traded up to grab Mitch Trubisky, would have to make the deal. He's not exactly the Al Einstein of the NFL. What's going to be the package? Khalil Mack, draft picks, Wrigley Field, the Hancock Center and a traffic jam to be named later?"
Trivia answer
Brown went 21-11 with Texas in 1992. His 21 victories and 2652/3 innings led the American League, though he was only sixth in Cy Young voting.
