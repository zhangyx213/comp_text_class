No way to justify Moore's behavior
I am stunned by those who support Roy Moore under the guise of "he is innocent until proven guilty." President Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee endorse this predator simply because the charges against him are alleged and not proven in a court of law.
I would remind those who hide behind this flawed reasoning that an election is not conducted in a court of law; it is conducted in the court of public opinion. The allegations against Moore are credible. They involve him using his political power to entice, molest and silence young girls.
So please, spare me the quasi-legal justifications because you want lower taxes. Those who stand with this man stand on the side of evil.

Nativity scene reflects poorly on Catholic traditions
Regarding "A hipster holy family? Out-of-the-ordinary nativities on display at Belleville cathedral" (online Dec. 8):
Yeah, pretty sure Mary didn't have her bra showing at the birth of Jesus. Poor taste, Monsignor, and shameful to allow this to be posted. This reflects poorly on our Catholic faith and traditions, and showing up on the feast of the Immaculate Conception, it borders on the scandalous.

Is Senate Bill 5 an example of gender discrimination?
I was dismayed to read the commentary about Senate Bill 5, "Missouri's attack on women's reproductive rights" (Dec. 6), stating that a woman can be evicted or fired for getting an abortion, using birth control or becoming pregnant out of wedlock. I wonder whether SB5 also states that a man can be fired or evicted for using a condom, getting a vasectomy or fathering a child out of wedlock?
If it does not, then SB5 is a clear case of discrimination based on gender and needs to be struck down. This "abstinence only" policy in employment and housing needs to be applied for both genders or not at all. "Not at all" would be preferable.
In addition, if employers and landlords have the legal capacity to ask women about their health history, do the employees or tenants have the right to say, "It is not any of your business"? If we have forsaken all of our privacy rights, then why do they even bother with those HIPAA forms?
Finally, I truly do not understand a society that makes it so difficult for responsible women to obtain methods of contraception, while also restricting access to abortions. Where is the logic in that? If you truly want to reduce abortions, make contraception readily available to anyone (male or female, rich or poor) who wants it.

GOP aims to transform public agencies into private entities
If you still identify as an orthodox Republican, at some point you have to ask yourself why.
Party of fiscal responsibility? Nope; just passed a tax bill that increases the national debt by more than $1 trillion.
Party of family values? Nope; see Roy Moore and the guy in the Oval Office. Understand that neither side has moral high ground here, but only one side claims it.
Party that will keep us safe from hostile foreign powers? Nope; unless you believe Vladimir Putin, et. al. are BFFs of the U.S.
The new GOP does appear to adhere to one principle: smaller government, but with twist. They want to transform public agencies into private entities, including at some point, Social Security and Medicare.
If you believe that an all-charter school system is better than continuing to fund public schools, that privately run prisons are better than those currently publicly operated, and that we will be personally better off in emergencies (floods, fires) when we are depending on the tender mercies of private responders, then I guess the Republican Party still has a place for you.
I would just advise you to remember one thing: There is a reason that airport security was federalized after 9/11.

Paper also flip-flops on states' rights
Regarding the editorial "Have gun, will travel" (Dec. 8):
Like the Republican Party, the Post-Dispatch editorial board flip-flops on when there should be federal oversight or when states should choose. And of course it goes with what the board supports.
So if the editorial board wants to point out the hypocrisy of the Republican Party, it might want to start by looking in the mirror.

U.S. can show leadership on global education
It's hard to imagine what life would have been like without school, but that's the case for 263 million kids around the world who won't make it into a classroom this year. It doesn't have to be this way, and there's something we can do about it.
Right now, the Global Partnership for Education is launching a new plan to give millions more kids the education that is their fundamental right. But that plan requires resources to make it a reality. Unfortunately this year the White House tried to cut funding for global education. But our leaders in Congress are pushing back.
I hope we can count on our senators and representatives to help make sure the U.S. shows leadership with the Global Partnership for Education.

 This nativity scene proves there is a set for almost every culture and time, says Monsignor John Myler of Belleville's Cathedral of St. Peter. The "hipster nativity" was created in 2016 and includes Mary and Joseph taking a selfie with baby Jesus, the Three Wise Men on Segways carrying Amazon Prime boxes, and a "100 percent organic" cow eating gluten-free feed.
