The contraceptive adhesive, applied weekly, may be more convenient for women than the pill, which must be taken daily.
The birth control pill, the trusted standby for millions of women for 40 years, is a virtually perfect contraceptive - but only if users remember to take it every day.
Soon, women may have a more convenient, less forgettable option that works in the same way.
A study being published today in the Journal of the American Medical Association says that the world's first contraceptive skin patch is just as safe and effective as the pill and that women are more likely to use it properly.
PATCH09
The adhesive patch, which will be marketed as Ortho Evra, is expected to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration this year. Doctors say it is easier to follow the regimen for the once-a-week patch than the pill, which could reduce the already low number of unwanted pregnancies that occur on the pill.
"This could be revolutionary. If it catches on, it could really be big," said Dr. Elliot Cazes of Gentle Care OB/Gyn in North Tampa. "Compliance is everything. That's the biggest shortcoming of birth control pills.
"In certain patient groups, like teenagers, where you have compliance problems, boy, oh boy it could be fantastic - give them a patch, put it on once a week."
The thin beige patch, about the size of a Post-It Note, can be worn on the buttocks or abdomen. Like the pill, it regulates the menstrual cycle and prevents pregnancy by steadily releasing small amounts of estrogen and progestin into the body. Women put on a new patch each week for three weeks, then go without it the fourth week.
The patch was developed by Johnson & Johnson's Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical, maker of the nation's leading birth control pill, Ortho Tri-cyclen. The company's research foundation paid for the study, which was conducted at 45 clinics in the United States and Canada.
Researchers randomly assigned patches to 812 healthy adult women and birth control pills to 605. They were followed for six or 13 months.
Five women got pregnant on the patch; seven got pregnant on the pill, but the difference was judged statistically insignificant.
Both methods had few side effects, although the patch caused minor skin irritation for about 20 percent of the women, the study showed. Some also reported more breast discomfort right before their period.
And according to the JAMA article, nearly 90 percent of women on the patch used it properly, compared with about 80 percent of the women on the pill. The authors attributed the better compliance of the patch to having to use it weekly, rather than daily.
"Women for the past 40 years have gotten used to the traditional use of daily birth control pills, and the tedium and the inconvenience of doing that has become a daily routine," said one of the study's chief investigators, Dr. William D. Koltun, director of the Medical Center for Women's Clinical Research in San Diego.
"When given the option of using the weekly patch, they felt a significant degree of freedom. And it was a refreshing experience for most of them."
When the trial ended, patients who had used the patch wanted to know how soon it would be on the market, he said. Its cost is still unknown.
When the birth control pill exploded onto the U.S. market in 1960, it revolutionized contraception. Although other medicines and devices have been developed, including two versions of hormonal treatments that are injected monthly or every three months, the pill by far remains the most popular reversible method (slightly more women choose tubal ligation).
Still, in a 1999 survey of 2,500 women in the United States, Europe and Japan, two out of three pill users said they didn't like having to take it every day.
"We want women to have the widest possible choice in birth control and access to every method there is," said Wendy Grassy, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood of Southwest and Central Florida.
But, she stressed, no method is foolproof: "You still have to remember to change that patch every week. . . . There's always risk if you wait too long."
