Georgia women have a right to know the truth about the proposed "woman's right to know" law: It's demeaning to them and another sneak attack on legal abortion.
This latest attempt to strip women of their reproductive freedom is disguised as a measure to safeguard their health. It's a shabby disguise because the law implies that Georgia women and their doctors are too ignorant to decide something as personal as abortion without the heavy-handed intrusion of the state.

Under court challenge in many states, "woman's right to know" laws mandate that patients wait at least 24 hours before undergoing abortions. During the delay, women must be force-fed state-produced propaganda slanted against abortion. At its core, the proposal is an insult to women because it presumes that a patient who arrives at a clinic or doctor's office seeking an abortion has not already thought long and hard about the matter.
It also would require doctors to recite a state-written script, a grave government interference into the doctor-patient relationship.
For example, the Georgia law would order doctors to explain a supposed link between abortion and breast cancer, a scientific fiction unsupported by the National Cancer Institute or the American Cancer Society. Doctors also have to warn patients that they could hemorrhage, become infertile or risk future pregnancies.
Doctors must mention the possible psychological fallout from an abortion. Doctors must underscore their discussions with "pictures or drawings representing the development of unborn children at two-week gestational increments."
On the bright side, the doctor must tell patients that the government may pay their medical bills and those of their fetuses if the pregnancy continues. Though not an attorney, the doctor is also expected to counsel women that they're eligible to collect child support from the fathers.
Advocates of the bill contend that they seek only to protect women's health. While their concern is touching, it is apparently limited to those of one gender, because they offer no companion bill offering such "protection" for men undergoing surgical procedures such as vasectomies.
A "man's right to know" law would require men to stay any snips until the state fully informs them of possible aftereffects. Men must be made to understand the potentially deep scars, psychological and otherwise, through slides and photos. And men will also have to be advised that if they reject the procedure, their wives would be financially liable for any future children.
The General Assembly's enthusiasm for informed consent laws seems to vary depending on the medical procedure. In 1984, the Legislature rejected a mandatory informed- consent law that would have required doctors inform women of the full range of treatments for breast cancer. At the time, opponents argued that women would be too easily confused by too much information in one sitting.
The women of Georgia ought to let the 2003 Legislature know that they're neither easily confused nor fooled by opportunists using women's health as a pretense for advancing an anti-abortion political agenda.
