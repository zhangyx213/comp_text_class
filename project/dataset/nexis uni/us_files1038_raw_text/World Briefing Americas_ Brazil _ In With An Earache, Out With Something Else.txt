     A 39-year-old farmer who went to a clinic to have an earache checked ended up having a vasectomy after mistakenly believing that the doctor had called his name, the clinic's manager said. Vanessa Guimaraes, the manager of the clinic, in Montes Claros, an agricultural center in the vast central state of Minas Gerais, said the farmer, Valdemar Lopes de Moraes, entered the vasectomy room when the name Aldemar Aparecido was called. 
"He was called by the full name, and yet thought it was him," Ms. Guimaraes said. "But the strangest thing is that he asked no questions when the doctor started preparations in the area which had so little to do with his ear." Mr. de Moraes, who has two children, did not want to reverse the operation and returned to the clinic for an ear exam.
