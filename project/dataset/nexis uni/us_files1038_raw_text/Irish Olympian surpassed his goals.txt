In Philadelphia, one's familiarity with Irish athletes usually is restricted to track and field, namely the Villanova pipeline that brought runners such as Marcus O'Sullivan, Eamonn Coghlan and Sonia O'Sullivan from the Emerald Isle to the Main Line.
But the 19th Winter Olympics brought world attention to an Irish skeleton slider. Clifton Wrottesley, 33, born in Dublin but now living in London, went into Wednesday's competition ranked 18th in the World Cup standings. However, he surprised everyone, including himself, by finishing fourth, just .42 seconds from a bronze medal.
"There was always the possibility of a medal, but you have to remain focused," said Wrottesley, who was third after the first of two runs before being passed by Gregor Staehli of Switzerland. "I actually almost forgot what I was doing on that first run, and that probably helped. I exceeded my expectations in what I thought I could do."
Wrottesley said he hoped he could do more at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, when skeleton will be included for only the second time since 1948.
"We have young [people] in the sport," he said. "I hope this will be an inspiration for youngsters. That's what I'm here for now. I set down a program that I needed to do this in 2002 and 2006. I felt if I got a top 10 this time, I could go for a medal in 2006."
That's determination. The late Jumbo Elliott, legendary Villanova track coach, would have liked this guy.
Family planning. Mormons encourage church members to be plentiful and procreate. The more, the merrier. That philosophy can be see in the health insurance given to workers at the Deseret News, Salt Lake City's Mormon-owned afternoon newspaper.
At a recent Olympic event, a non-Mormon reporter from the newspaper explained that he and his wife have two beautiful children, and that's enough. He wants a vasectomy, only he can't afford it, and his health insurance won't pay for it.
"I have friends who have gotten vasectomies, and their insurance pays for them," the reporter said.
But the insurance provided by the newspaper will only cover a vasectomy if the reporter already has five children or his wife is over 40.

Strange town. Ticket scalpers, of which there are scores, can roam the streets shouting "Who needs tickets? I got tickets!"
But homeless people can't orally seek contributions. They have to carry signs asking for monetary assistance.

Beautiful town. It is early Sunday morning. A perfect sunrise makes the Wasatch Mountain peaks sparkle. The downtown streets are empty. Silent too, except for the birdlike electronic chirping that signals it is safe for pedestrians to cross a street.
And then, like some angelic soundtrack, the live, majestic voices of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir rise from behind the walls of Temple Square.
A long way from home, you linger an instant. Then, refreshed, you're off again, bound for blueberry waffles with maple butter, hash browns and sausage. Or not.
Goodbye, Salt Lake City.
