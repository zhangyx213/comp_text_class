SAN FRANCISCO -- It may never make it on the political menu, but the animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals is urging city leaders in San Francisco to change the name of its legendarily gritty Tenderloin to something with decidedly less gristle.
In a letter to Mayor Edwin M. Lee sent Tuesday, Tracy Reiman, the group's executive vice president, suggested that city officials rename the neighborhood the Tempeh District, a homage to a soy-based meat substitute.
''San Francisco is now renowned for some of the best vegan cuisine in the world,'' Ms. Reiman wrote. ''And the city deserves a neighborhood named after a delicious cruelty-free food instead of the flesh of an abused animal.''
Mayor Lee did not have an immediate comment, but Tenderloin aficionados were quick to point out that the moniker had little to do with meat and more to do with a neighborhood's olden reputation as a place where the police were on the take, receiving ''tenderloin,'' or bribes, to turn a blind eye.
''It really referred to areas of vice and corruption,'' said Randy Shaw, a longtime housing advocate in the Tenderloin who hopes to open a museum devoted to its rough-and-tumble past. ''It wasn't like they were giving them steaks. They were giving them cash.''
Mr. Shaw added that he had said as much to PETA in an e-mail this week, mentioning that the neighborhood's official name was the Uptown Tenderloin, something recognized in the area's recent listing on the National Register of Historic Places.
''They were pleased to hear that,'' Mr. Shaw said.
PETA, of course, has always had a flair for publicity -- another proposal this week promised to pay for the vasectomy of one man in the nation who agreed to neuter his cat or dog.
But Ashley Gonzalez, a spokeswoman for the group, said the Tenderloin name change would be ''reflective of the philosophies'' of San Francisco's famously liberal locals.
''If any town's going to do it,'' Ms. Gonzalez said, '' it's going to be San Francisco.''
