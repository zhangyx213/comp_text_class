REDWOOD CITY, Calif. -- Scott Peterson's former mistress on Tuesday said he wooed her passionately in the weeks before his wife, Laci, disappeared -- all the while spinning a web of lies.
The first day of Amber Frey's long-awaited testimony in the third month of Scott Peterson's murder trial was calm and self-assured. And while it shed few new details about a case that has fascinated America, it drew an unstinting image for the jury of an adulterer leading a double life.
Frey's ability to bolster the prosecution's theory that Peterson killed his wife to take up with her is thought to be crucial to a case lacking in physical evidence. Peterson could face the death penalty if convicted.
Frey, a massage therapist, recalled a phone conversation on Christmas Day 2002, amid the frantic search for Laci Peterson a day after she vanished, in which she and Scott Peterson talked about a nursery rhyme about ducks.
Frey went to police days after learning that Peterson was married. Police then recorded more than 300 calls between the couple. Prosecutors hope the calls will show that Peterson is capable of murder.
Defense lawyer Mark Geragos concedes that Peterson was involved with Frey but says that doesn't make him a killer. The defense hasn't begun to cross-examine her.
In a long New Year's Day conversation that police recorded when Peterson pretended to be in Paris, Frey said they continued a debate about commitment. She was hopeful. He was tentative. He said he wanted to get a vasectomy. She worried that that was "too permanent" for a young man.
Prosecutors say Peterson, 31, killed his pregnant wife Dec. 23 or 24 and dumped her body in San Francisco Bay. He says she was alive when he left their Modesto, Calif., home Christmas Eve morning to go fishing but was gone when he came home that afternoon.
Geragos has portrayed a sloppy police investigation so focused on Peterson that it ignored other leads. The defense theorizes that someone else snatched Laci Peterson, 27, killed her and put her body in the bay to frame her husband after his alibi was public.
Prosecutors' strongest evidence so far is the location where the bodies of Laci Peterson and her unborn son were found in April 2003, about a mile from where Scott Peterson said he was fishing. But they have no cause or time of death, no murder weapon and no witnesses.
Under questioning from Geragos, detectives have acknowledged that searches of the bay, the Peterson home and his truck, boat and warehouse yielded nothing to link him to her slaying.
Frey's help in establishing a motive looms as even more important after a series of missteps by the prosecution.
A gag order keeps either side from talking publicly, but a juror dismissed in June blasted the prosecution's case as unconvincing and dull.
When prosecutors said Peterson couldn't have watched a Martha Stewart Living segment with his wife on the morning of Dec. 24 because it hadn't mentioned meringue as he claimed, Geragos brought TV screens and videos to court to prove them wrong.
Frey on Tuesday described Peterson as a man she quickly came to trust, easygoing, and loving to her 21-month-old daughter. She recalled an intimate night in his hotel room on their first date Nov. 20, after champagne and strawberries, dinner at a Japanese restaurant and drinks at a karaoke bar.
He plied her with compliments and made her feel comfortable, she said. On their second date, he brought groceries to make seafood lasagna. They hiked in the mountains, had a picnic and spent the night together again. The next night, she said, he picked up her daughter, let himself in with a key she had given him and again spent the night.
But Peterson, a former fertilizer salesman, had lied to her from the start, Frey testified. He told her he had never been married. He said he lived in Sacramento. He said he would be fishing with relatives in Alaska during Thanksgiving and would be in Europe most of January, explaining why he couldn't see her.
On Dec. 9, their fourth date, he admitted that he lied about being married. He told her he had "lost his wife" and that it was too painful to talk about, so he told people he had never married. Peterson was crying, Frey said. But she said she had no idea he was telling her because a friend of hers confronted him about his marriage.
Still, Frey asked him whether he was ready for a relationship with her. "Absolutely," she said Peterson told her.
