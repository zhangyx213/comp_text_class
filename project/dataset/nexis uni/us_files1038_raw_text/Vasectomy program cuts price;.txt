LAND O' LAKES - A Tampa urologist partners with Pasco County's health department to offer  low-cost vasectomies.
An attractive woman with an alluring smile issues a challenge from the pages of the local  newspaper:
"Can you do it, big guy?"
The photo caption isn't referring to mowing the lawn or cleaning the garage, and she isn't  looking for a date.
It's an advertisement for vasectomy services, performed by Tampa urologist Douglas Stein at  Pasco County Health Department offices in New Port Richey and Dade City.
Stein has worked with the health departments in Hillsborough and Pinellas counties and with  regional Planned Parenthood clinics for several years.
His partnership with Pasco began in January. Several weeks ago, the newspaper advertisements  started. Posters are up in health departments and brochures are available. Radio may be the next  medium.
Some of the ads - all of them were paid for by Stein - feature him and his wife, Maryann. In one,  she has her arms around her grinning husband, under the caption: "My hero."
Creative marketing, Stein says, is a key to raising awareness and getting people talking about  vasectomies.
Pinellas County's health department got plenty of discussion out of a campaign it launched a  couple of years ago. That agency put coasters in bars with the message, "Make my next one a  vasectomy."
Offering vasectomies at county health departments - where the cost can be considerably lower than  private options - is a good way to reach men who may not otherwise consider the birth control  procedure.
"They should be readily available and affordable to everybody, particularly those with low  incomes," Stein said.
"I can't count how many men I've talked to who said they've thought about doing it before, but  couldn't afford it."
Stein is in Pasco from 8 a.m. to noon on the fourth Friday of each month, alternating between  Dade City and New Port Richey each time, said Becky Thomas, health department spokeswoman.
Although vasectomies have been available through the health department before, Thomas said  Stein's method is a new service here. It takes about 15 to 20 minutes and doesn't involve a  scalpel. The cost is $ 290.
Stein, who had a vasectomy 11 years ago, is a passionate advocate of the procedure - and not just  because it's his business.
Vasectomies are 10 times more effective than tubal ligation or birth control pills, he said.  With some research putting the rate of unplanned pregnancies as high as 50 percent, Stein says the  government should be aggressively promoting ways to control the birth rate.
Doing something about unplanned pregnancies could do a lot to reduce welfare costs, he adds.
"I can recycle every day for the rest of my life and it won't do as much as preventing one  unintended pregnancy," Stein says.    (CHART) Find out more  For information about vasectomies, call the Pasco County Health Department at (727) 869-3900, Ext.  262, or (352) 521-1450, Ext. 306.  Urologist Douglas Stein has a Web site -  that offers additional information about the  procedure.  Lorie Jewell can be reached at (813) 948-4216 or
