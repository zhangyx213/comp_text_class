Body


“Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.”
That guarantee attracted bipartisan support, and both the House and the Senate approved the Equal Rights Amendment in the 1970s. But then it fell three states short of ratification. Today it is largely forgotten, a reality that the filmmaker Kamala Lopez hopes to change.
Her fact-packed new documentary,  features legal experts, ordinary women and top-line feminists (including Eleanor Smeal and Gloria Steinem), who are still making a case for the amendment decades later.
How much do we really know about women in our society? Let’s see, with a quiz based on the film.
True or False?
1. The United States Constitution guarantees women equal rights.
2. There is substantial support in Congress for criminalizing vasectomy.
Multiple Choice
3. Who is Lilly Ledbetter?
A. The professional wrestler who broke the sex barrier.
B. An American worker who sued Goodyear for 29 years of unequal pay.
C. A British women’s suffragist.
On Ms. Lopez’s high-speed guided tour, colorful paper-doll graphics in 1950s dress zoom across the screen to illustrate her points. Most often the mother and child paper dolls slide off the steep slopes of fever charts and crash or shrink and are crushed by avalanches of numbers.
The real women Ms. Lopez interviews speak of contraception denied, rape unpunished, family leave legislation ignored, pay inequities unaddressed, children plucked from foster care and forced irretrievably into prostitution, and women’s shelters shut down for lack of funds.
Broader than it is deep, “Equal Means Equal” still drills down into enough specific issues to shock us afresh. Perhaps most stunning is the idea that many laws are toothless. The only recourse in the case of discrimination is the court system, not a terribly hospitable place for those paper dolls in the full-skirted frocks.
