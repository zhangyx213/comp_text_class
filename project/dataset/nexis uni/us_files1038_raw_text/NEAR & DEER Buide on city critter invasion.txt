NEW YORKERS really need to embrace their wild sides.
That's the message of WildlifeNYC, a citywide education and awareness campaign set to launch Friday, the Daily News has learned.
Sparked by the booming deer population in Staten Island and coyote sightings across the city, the campaign urges New Yorkers to appreciate wildlife from afar - and not panic when they encounter a critter.
"WildlifeNYC's emphasis on education, outreach and humane population control will help all New Yorkers care for our urban environment - and the animals who share it with us," said Mayor de Blasio.
The multi-agency effort includes posters, billboards and banners around the five boroughs featuring photos of deer on a backdrop of the Manhattan skyline and the message: "City dwellers take many forms."
A new web portal - nyc.gov/wildlife - will allow New Yorkers to report a wildlife sighting, learn about different species and get instruction on what to do and what not to do.
New Yorkers have had a mixed response to the sight of deer, coyotes, raccoons, skunks and other wildlife on city streets.
While some welcome the critters, others complain they are a nuisance and should be removed by the city.
Wildlife rehabilitator Bobby Horvath, who is also a city firefighter, said he was happy the city was paying attention to the issue.
He said he hopes people get the message to leave the animals alone.
"People need to enjoy wildlife from afar," said Horvath, whose group Wildlife in Need of Rescue and Rehabilitation volunteers to help injured and sick wild animals in the city.
"Once people start feeding them, it causes a problem for the animals."
New Yorkers were stunned last year when lone coyotes were spotted in Chelsea and on Riverside Drive.
And coyotes have established dens in the Bronx and Queens.
Raccoons, skunks and opossum have been spotted more regularly in backyards - especially those located near parks, cemeteries and other large swaths of green space across the five boroughs.
But the deer situation in Staten Island has reached a critical mass, officials said.
A 2014 aerial survey of Staten Island showed 763 deer over 18.7 square miles, according to the Parks Department.
Experts say the number may be even higher.
The overpopulation of deer in the borough could result in more car crashes and tick-bourne illness.
In May, the city came up with a plan to reduce the surging deer population - giving vasectomies to hundreds of males.
The birth control method was fast-tracked and decided to be a better option than hunting the hoofed animals.
"It's important to understand your neighbors - even the feathered and furry ones," said city Parks Commissioner Mitchell Silver.
"WildlifeNYC gives us a collaborative framework work to educate New Yorkers about living safely alongside wildlife, and humane approaches to address wildlife impacts on our communities."
