A new, longer-lasting version of the standard drug for hepatitis C is much more effective in treating the liver disease, two studies show. About 4 million Americans are infected with hepatitis C, which causes liver inflammation and can lead to cirrhosis and cancer. The drugs available to treat it are not very effective and can have serious side effects. Standard treatment for the blood-borne virus is injections of interferon alpha or a combination of interferon and another antiviral drug, ribavirin. Two studies, sponsored by drug maker Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., tested its modified form of interferon, called Pegasys, against its standard interferon, Roferon-A. The findings in today's New England Journal of Medicine show the new version is significantly better at eliminating the virus. Pegasys was tested at 36 centers outside the United States between 1997 and 1999; 531 patients received either regular interferon or Pegasys for 48 weeks. Pegasys was twice as effective, the researchers said. Signs of the virus disappeared in 39 percent of the Pegasys group versus 19 percent for the regular interferon group.CONSTITUTION
Warning brochures for acne drug: Patients who take the acne drug Accutane will soon get warning brochures outlining side effects --- including a possible, but not proven, link to suicide. Patients must then sign a paper certifying they understand those risks, health officials told Congress Tuesday. The MedGuide warning brochures, attached to every bottle sold --- along with patient informed-consent forms --- may be distributed as early as next month, the Food and Drug Administration said. Also, the FDA is developing tougher restrictions on who can take Accutane and which doctors can prescribe it. This so-called registry is an attempt to counter another Accutane problem: 2,000 women have gotten pregnant while taking Accutane since 1982. Accutane causes severe birth defects. While there is no scientific proof that Accutane causes depression or suicide, the FDA has received 66 reports of suicides among Accutane users or former users.
Menstrual cycles and tubal sterilization: Do women increase their risk of menstrual problems if they get sterilized by having their tubes tied? A new study says the answer is no. Surgical sterilization is considered safe and effective, but questions have persisted about whether it makes women's periods worse. After two decades of study, the researchers found that the ''post-tubal-ligation syndrome'' doctors have worried about since the 1950s does not exist. The study, in today's New England Journal of Medicine, found that women who are sterilized are no more likely to develop menstrual problems than women who are not. If anything, they actually have shorter, less painful periods and bleed less. The five-year study tracked 9,514 women who were sterilized between 1978 and 1987 and compared them with 573 women whose partners had vasectomies between 1985 and 1987.
Cells transformed into bone: Researchers have made unspecialized embryo cells transform into bone for the first time, an advance that may offer hope for repairing diseased bones and correcting genetic bone disorders. Nearly 90 percent of the mouse embryonic stem cells evolved into bone nodules when allowed to grow in a lab dish for 21 days, Lee Buttery, a British scientist, told a symposium on stem cell research in London on Wednesday. Buttery's work is to be published in the January issue of the journal Tissue Engineering. Embryonic stem cells, the predecessors of all tissue in the body, have become a hot area of medical research because scientists believe they may eventually be able to treat scores of diseases by renewing sick body parts with injections of replacement cells. Embryonic stem cells have already been converted into nerve and muscle cells in previous research. Brigid Hogan, a stem cell researcher from Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn., said that while the British research adds bone to the list of cell types that have successfully been derived from embryo stem cells, using cells from adults might be a more simple and practical approach for bone disorders. She said scientists have demonstrated that skin taken from adults can be turned into bone and that most of the excitement over embryo stem cell research centers on the hope for producing transplantable cells that are desperately needed, such as brain cells for Parkinson's disease patients and insulin-producing pancreatic cells for diabetics.
The toll of depression: Depression can test or destroy relationships, according to ''Depression, Women and Intimacy,'' a booklet distributed by the National Depressive and Manic-Depressive Association. For many women the greatest cost of clinical depression can be the harm it does to their relationship with their partners. Women without partners can find it difficult to start a relationship.
