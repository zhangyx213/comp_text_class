Gabriella Avina had bad luck with birth control - even her husband's vasectomy failed. Wary of the surgery required for sterilization, she tested a dramatically different approach: an experimental device to permanently block her fallopian tubes that doctors inserted without making a single cut.
Scientists have long tried, and failed, to develop a nonsurgical way to sterilize women. But studies with volunteers such as Avina suggest a tiny springlike device called Essure may soon offer that option - a method that, if it passes government scrutiny next year, could transform how many women end their childbearing years.
"I kept saying, 'You're sure? You're sure?' " Avina recalled, as doctors took X-rays and performed other tests to ensure the Martinez, Calif., nurse - happy with three children - won't get pregnant again. "It was so easy."
Sterilization is the most widely used form of contraception. More than 180 million women worldwide have had it performed, including hundreds of thousands of Americans each year. In tubal ligation, doctors cut and tie the fallopian tubes, or cauterize or clip them shut, to keep eggs released by the ovaries from reaching the uterus. It requires either conventional surgery or laparoscopic surgery, where doctors work through small incisions in the abdomen.
Tubal ligation is very safe but does carry some risks, plus it takes time to recover.
So gynecologists have sought a nonsurgical option. Repeated attempts since the 1970s have failed, as plugs or inserted medications have proven either ineffective or dangerous.
Enter Essure. It looks like a tiny spring. Flexible coils temporarily anchor it inside the fallopian tube. Dacronlike mesh embedded in those coils - material widely used in medical procedures - irritates the tube's lining and, over three months, causes scar tissue to grow. That scar tissue permanently plugs the tube.
Essure is inserted in a half-hour procedure called hysteroscopic sterilization that requires only local anesthetic. Doctors thread a thin tube - the hysteroscope - that contains a camera and a coil-holding catheter into the uterus and then into each fallopian tube. A twist of the catheter leaves Essure in place.
It doesn't offer immediate birth control, cautions Jay Cooper, a Phoenix gynecologist who is leading U.S. clinical trials for manufacturer Conceptus Inc. A woman must use a second contraceptive for three months, and then return for testing to ensure the scar tissue has fully blocked her tubes.
