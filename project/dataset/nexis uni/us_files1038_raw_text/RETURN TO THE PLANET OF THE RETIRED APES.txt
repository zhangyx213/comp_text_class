WHERE DO chimpanzees go to retire? Why Florida, of course.
Forty-five apes - former Air Force test chimps and their offspring - are spending their golden years on a 200-acre patch of former orange groves outside Fort Pierce.
The Islands in the Sun sanctuary is the life's work of primatologist Carole Noon, who found her calling when she heard Jane Goodall lecture about chimps.
"Basically, I fell in love with chimps," said Noon. "The more I watched them, the more I saw the complex societies they put together for themselves. They have a whole set of rules they live by."
The chimps - some of whom NASA used in the "chimpanaut" program to test the effects of space travel - live on a half-dozen man-made 3-acre islands in the sanctuary.
The oldest apes were born in Africa, and some, like 41-year-old Gromek, were traumatized at an early age.
"His mother was shot out from under him when he was captured," Noon said.
The youngest chimp in the sanctuary is 2 1/2-year-old Angie - the product of a failed vasectomy, Noon said.
Other than the weather, there is little to remind the chimps of their natural habitat, the African rain forest.
Bridges connect the islands, which have catwalks and - what else? - jungle gyms for the chimps to clamber on instead of lush foliage. There are shelters, and artificial hills and valleys where the apes can roam. There are tires to play with and hammocks for dozing.
Instead of foraging for food, the chimps have a chow time announced by a dinner bell.
Noon is hoping to complete the construction of six more islands to house the 260 chimps still stranded in New Mexico.
