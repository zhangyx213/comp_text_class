FERTILITY.
Vasectomies may not be as reversible as doctors had previously thought. New research presented at a meeting of the British Fertility Society shows that the operation has a long-lasting effect on sperm count.
HEAD INJURY
Each year, bike-related crashes kill about 900 people and injure 567,000 others. Statistics show that 67,000 of these injuries are head injuries ­and most of them, 80% to 85%, would have been less severe or prevented altogether if the rider had been wearing a helmet.
STRESS
As the April 15 tax deadline approaches, nearly three-fourths of all Americans cite money worries as the
No. 1 factor that affects their stress level. Work, physical health and
children follow next, according to a survey commissioned by the American Psychological Association.
