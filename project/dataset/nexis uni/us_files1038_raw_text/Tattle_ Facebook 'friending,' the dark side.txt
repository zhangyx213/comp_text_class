TATTLE IS often a column featuring cautionary tales, usually involving celebrities.
But occasionally we come across a story in which there is such an important lesson to be learned, for the good of our readers we feel compelled to bring it to you even if it does not involve someone from "The Hills" or a curvy Kardashian.
According to News of the World, Brit Dominic Baronet, 26, is a Facebook menace.
Do not "friend" Dominic, ladies, although it's unlikely he could scrape together the cash to cross the pond. And why should he? He's got plenty of British boobs to choose from.
News of the World has branded Dominic The Sperminator because of his willingness and ability to impregnate women whom he's met on the social networking site.
Overall, he's worked his bedroom magic on a DOZEN women - two of them on the SAME DAY. 
See, it's not just your computer that needs protection.
News of the World says five women are now raising his kids, two are expecting his kids and five more had their pregnancies terminated.
As for Dominic, he's clearly daddy material - being a convicted drug dealer.
One of his recent conquests, Kerry Martin, told News of the World: "Dominic should have a danger warning slapped on his Facebook page and be given a compulsory vasectomy to protect other girls."
Huh? It's not like Dominic got you pregnant without your participation.
How about not having unprotected sex with a slimeball you just met on Facebook?
Internet commerce updateA federal judge has temporarily blocked two music-sharing Web sites from selling songs by The Beatles, The Beach Boys, Coldplay, Lily Allen and other artists for 25 cents apiece.
Judge John F. Walter last week blocked the sites BlueBeat.com and Basebeat.com and owner Hank Risan from selling the artists' copyrighted songs. Music company EMI Group filed a federal lawsuit last week seeking an injunction against the sites, claiming they were engaging in music piracy.
EMI claims the Web sites have infringed on its copyrights to the artists' songs. Its complaint states BlueBeat.com and Basebeat.com were offering the recently released digital remasters of The Beatles catalog for 25 cents per song.
The Web sites' attorney opposed EMI's injunction request, saying the sites are selling an altered version of the songs.
In an e-mail earlier this month to the Recording Industry Association of America's general counsel, Risan described the songs as a "psychoacoustic simulation" rather than the original, copyrighted works.
Asked to explain the concept, Risan replied, "Psychoacoustic simulations are my synthetic creation of that series of sounds which best expresses the way I believe a particular melody should be heard as a live performance."
Oo-bla-di oo-bla-da life goes on. . . . 
* As Wal-Mart, Amazon and Target go about destroying the book industry, don't think the struggling DVD industry is going to escape unscathed.
How high school is the price war?
As we head into the holiday shopping season, Wal-Mart announced online prices for the DVDs of "Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince" and "Star Trek" at $10.
Amazon then reduced some of its DVD prices to $9.99.
And Wal-Mart fired back by lowering prices to $9.98.
As the old joke goes, we lose money on every sale, but we make it up on volume.
Tattbits* Dennis Hopper, 73 and battling prostate cancer, attended the Breeders' Cup Saturday in support of The V Foundation for Cancer Research.
It was revealed last month that Hopper had been diagnosed with cancer, although he said Saturday that he's been battling it for the past nine years. He's started a new, experimental treatment at the University of Southern California that he says "has great promise."
Hopper is one of racing's biggest and best-known fans, having been to five Breeders' Cups. Last year he said he cashed a $17,000 trifecta ticket in the Classic, the signature race on thoroughbred racing's championship day.
This year's Classic was won by Zenyatta, a 5-year-old mare. It was the first time a girl has ever beaten the boys in the race.
* Michael Jackson's father, Joe, is seeking an allowance from his son's estate to help cover expenses that exceed $15,000 a month, according to court documents filed Friday.
The request, seeking an unspecified amount, was filed by lawyer Brian Oxman, who said there was no apparent reason for the administrators of the estate to not seek an allowance for the Jackson family patriarch.
Oh, we can think of a bunch of reasons.
The latest court documents said Joe receives a $1,700 monthly Social Security payment and had relied on his son for support for many years.
"He does not have a regular or steady source of income, and he was dependent upon the money provided by his son, Michael Jackson, through his wife, Katherine Jackson, for his support," the filing stated.
It must be great to have no steady source of income but have expenses that exceed $15,000 per month.
* James Woods played a shark lawyer on TV.
Now he needs one.
Woods has sued a Rhode Island hospital over the 2006 death of his younger brother, Michael, who was 49 when he died at Kent Hospital in Warwick of what was believed to be a heart attack.
Woods, who is the executor of his brother's estate, claims his brother received negligent medical care.
* The Hollywood Reporter says local-boy-makes-good actor Bradley Cooper is set to star in the thriller "Dark Fields," from director Neil Burger.
The story follows a down-and-out writer (Cooper) who gets his hands on a top-secret pharmaceutical drug that makes one smarter. He experiences sudden financial and social success but soon discovers that the drug has lethal side effects.
* Hawaii Uh-Oh.
The Honolulu Symphony said Friday it's canceling concerts for the rest of the year and filing for bankruptcy, citing a big drop in donations.
The symphony is the oldest in the nation west of the Rocky Mountains.
The 109-year-old body hopes to come back as a leaner and more efficient operation.
Goodbye horn section.
