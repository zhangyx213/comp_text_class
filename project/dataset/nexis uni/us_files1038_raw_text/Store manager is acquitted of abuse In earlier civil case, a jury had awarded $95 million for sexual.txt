BELLEVILLE - Despite a $95 million civil court award for sexual harassment, a former O'Fallon, Ill., store manager was found not guilty in a criminal court on Wednesday of allegations he threw an employee down and sexually abused her.
Richard G. Moore, who was the general manager at an Aaron's store, part of a national chain that leases furniture, office products and electronics, was found not guilty by a St. Clair County jury of criminal sexual abuse against Ashley Alford, then 20, dating to October 2006, court records say.
It's a stark contrast to a case last June, when Alford won $95 million in federal civil damages against Moore and the Aaron's chain. That jury found that Moore had assaulted and battered Alford, and found Aaron's liable for "negligent supervision," "sexual harassment" and "intentional infliction of emotional distress."
The verdict was reduced in August by a federal judge to $41 million. Aaron's is appealing, calling it a "classic runaway jury."
The burden of proof to establish guilt is higher in criminal cases than civil cases. The acquittal doesn't negate the civil judgment.
Alford alleged Moore hit her in the head with his penis while she was sitting on the floor of the stockroom. On Oct. 12, 2006, she alleged Moore threw her down and masturbated on her as he pinned her down. He cleaned up semen with a paper towel, she alleged.
Moore, 45, was arrested the day of the alleged masturbation incident. Semen was found on a paper towel, but a DNA profile couldn't be developed because no sperm was detected. Moore had had a vasectomy.
Moore said Alford made it all up, and was possibly looking for money.
Alford, who alleged she was denied a promotion for complaining about the assault, had called a company sexual harassment hotline as early as May 2006, according to court documents, but only left her name and said she needed help.
Camille Olson, a lawyer representing Aaron's, said on Thursday that she was pleased with the criminal jury's verdict. She noted that the company had followed up on all complaints and that it had no reason to believe that Moore "wasn't fit for duty as a manager." She added that Alford denied having been harassed during the follow up.
Moore no longer works for the company, Olson said.
Alford's lawyer could not be reached for comment.
