Just so this highlight doesn't get lost in all the NFL's personnel moves this week (see more on Pages 68-69), let's take a minute to salute Jets cornerback Antonio Cromartie, inset. His wife, Terricka, announced that she is pregnant with twins ... despite her hubby's vasectomy. "I didn't even tell Antonio right away because I didn't think it was possible," she told Us Weekly. "In my head we were good to go, we were having free sex!
 I just really thought that his procedure was the best protection you could have at this point." Well, Terricka, who better than a defensive player to figure out how to beat a protection scheme? And in case we've all forgotten, Cromartie is the NFL's poster child for vasectomies - he already has fathered 10 children with several women, including Terricka, who was, shall we say, blindsided by the news. "It took me awhile to process it," she said, "but Antonio stood firm and was saying, 'It's God's will.'" We're betting that's not the first time that Antonio has used that line with a woman. (Just sayin'.) According to WebMD, only one to two women out of 1,000 get pregnant in the first year after their partner has the procedure. Even Bill Belichick couldn't game-plan for such odds.

HOOPS ETIQUETTE
Where 'air ball' is 'unsporting behavior'
How many times have you shouted "air ball!" at a basketball game in response to a shot that hits nothing but, well, air? Well, don't try that in Wisconsin. Citing a rise in taunting, the Wisconsin Interscholastic Athletic Association sent an email to schools last month that said in part, "Student groups, school administrators and event managers should take immediate steps to correct this unsporting behavior." Examples of such unseemly taunting included "air ball," "scoreboard," "fundamentals," "season's over" and "there's a net there." The admonishment came to light last week, when April Gehl, the leading scorer for Hilbert High, tweeted "Eat shit WIAA" to convey her opinion of the email. Gehl was suspended for five games for her choice of language in the post, which was retweeted more than 1,200 times. But some welcomed the WIAA's call for civility, while others saw it as further evidence of the coddling of Americans. Eric Simons, an author who has written about sports obsession, said we tend to get riled up by attempts to govern sports culture. "I don't think it's inevitable that people need to taunt their opponents in sports," Simons said, "and I think it's perfectly fair to question that." Regarding Wisconsin's tempest, he said, "I see that, actually, as sort of an ugly and messy, little necessary debate." Students in at least two schools protested at games by wearing duct tape on their mouths.
