HORMONES.
Hormone-replacement therapy, already linked to stroke, heart disease and breast cancer, may slightly raise the risk of developing asthma, ­researchers said Monday. 
The finding presents yet another factor women may need to consider when debating whether or not estrogen has a role in the short-term treatment of menopausal symptoms.
OBESITY
Children's waistlines have ­expanded by 4 cm - equivalent to two clothing sizes - over the past 20 years, according to new research reported in the Archives of Disease in Childhood. The study found that girls seem to be getting bigger faster than boys.
FERTILITY
A new study by physician-scientistsat New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center finds that vasectomy reversal is highly effective, even 15 years or more after the vas deferens, the tube that carries sperm, is blocked. The new research documents the highest pregnancy rates following vasectomy of any study to date.
