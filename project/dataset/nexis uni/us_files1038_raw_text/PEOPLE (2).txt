'Fuller House' executive fired over behavior
Producers of the Netflix remake "Fuller House" have fired the top executive behind the show amid charges about his behavior on the set. 
Warner Brothers Television said Wednesday that it would not renew Jeff Franklin's deal, without explaining why. Variety reports that there were complaints about him being verbally abusive to staffers and making inappropriate comments to the show's writers. There have been no accusations of sexual misconduct. 
Franklin's attorney, Stanton "Larry" Stein, says neither he nor his client have been told about what had been said that was deemed offensive. 
Besides working on the remake, Franklin was the creator of "Full House," the ABC show upon which it was based. Netflix says that it hopes to go into production for the show's fourth season in the next few months. 
Richards apologizes 
to Jagger for comment
Keith Richards says he regrets saying Mick Jagger needed a vasectomy after recently having his eighth child. 
In a story posted Wednesday, WSJ magazine reported that Richards said "it's time for the snip - you can't be a father at that age. Those poor kids!"
The 74-year-old Jagger welcomed his eighth child in December 2016. 
But Richards says "I deeply regret the comments I made about Mick" in a statement released Wednesday afternoon. He says his words "were completely out of line" and that he apologized to the Rolling Stone frontman in person. 
Richards wrote about his issues with Jagger in his 2010 memoir, "Life."
Markle wants to work on women's empowerment
Meghan Markle said Wednesday that she hopes to "hit the ground running" as a member of the British royal family and use her position to highlight the empowerment of women. 
Markle, who is due to marry Prince Harry in May, attended an event in London alongside Harry, Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge. 
The first joint engagement by the two couples celebrated the work of the Royal Foundation, which supports charities including the Heads Together mental-health campaign and the Invictus Games for injured troops. 
Markle said during a question-and-answer session that she was still new to her role but "it's very important to want to hit the ground running." 
The 36-year-old actress said that with the #MeToo and Time's Up campaigns against sexual harassment, "there is no better time to really continue to shine a light on women feeling empowered and people really helping to support them."
Harry, 33, said he and Markle were "pretty tied up with planning a wedding at the moment," but looked forward to working with William and Kate on charitable projects. 
"I think it's really good we've got four different personalities, we've all got that same passion to want to make a difference, but different opinions," he said. 
PBS launching new conservative talk show
Columnist Michael Gerson and commentator Amy Holmes are teaming to start a conservative-oriented talk show on PBS that takes its cue from William F. Buckley's "Firing Line," which aired from 1966 to 1999. 
The new show, "In Principle," will air Friday nights starting April 13. PBS will decide after an eight-week run whether to continue. 
The hosts plan to interview two guests each show, hoping for an in-depth discussion on issues and their formative political experiences. 
Gerson is known to the PBS audience as a frequent guest on "NewsHour." Holmes worked on MSNBC and on Glenn Beck's media company, The Blaze. 
Gerson has often found himself at odds with President Donald Trump. He said Holmes more often takes the president's side, or acts as the "anti-anti-Trump."
