Producer Terry Wrong calls his latest work for ABC News, the documentary series "Hopkins," a "unicorn, the rarest of rarest."
Unicorn isn't the right analogy. Comparing it to any of the 900-plus animals on the endangered species list might be more accurate.
That's sad.
What Wrong and his team of filmmakers have produced is a six-hour series about the people who work at, and are served by, Johns Hopkins Hospital. Based on a screening of the first episode, it's a fantastic piece of work.
It's the kind of effort viewers should support when it airs, on June 26 at 10 p.m. If people don't watch, work like this will go away, much the same way experienced anchors in local newsrooms are getting phased out - not because of their work, but because of the bottom line.
"Hopkins" is the veteran producer's second series at the hospital. The first aired in 2000, long before reality TV changed views of what's real or not, making it harder for producers to get approval for traditional documentaries.
The new breed of reality, however, has made huge celebs out of people like Lauren Conrad on MTV's "The Hills." There's little real, however, about that TV neighborhood.
But watch a few moments of Dr. Alfredo Quinones-Hinjosa working on a guy's brain, or surgeon Brian Bethea talking about his failing marriage, and you'll see real.
"Reality [TV] is a huge problem for documentary filmmakers," Wrong said. He's not kidding. But the truth is, most audiences don't recognize the difference.
Sure, one could argue that audiences for traditional documentaries have declined, as they have for much of everything else. Yet this is what TV news can do best, given its financial and viewer support. This is the kind of work that should be viewed on a TV screen, not a cell phone or a computer.
The TV world is different now than when the first "Hopkins" aired. Audiences are more fragmented and news divisions are looking to slash as audiences and revenues dwindle. Long-form programming usually is cut first.
Ultimately, we all suffer here.
Wrong understands that change, and has tried to adapt.
"I don't think we set out to be 'Nova,'" he said, citing the PBS science series. "We work in prime time. We set out to find story lines acceptable to the big audience."
So rather than follow a guy in the research lab, "Hopkins" has a female urologist deal with reversing a patient's vasectomy. There's also a dynamic brain surgeon and tough pediatric cases.
"We are influenced by the dramas," said Wrong, who said his team sought to find "stories that will work dramatically."
ABC News executive Phyllis McGrady said yesterday that it's harder now than in 2000 to get approval for a show like "Hopkins." "I'd like to think it's not the last one," she added.
It might be, though.
Without giving anything away, there's a moment near the end of the first episode when a guy sings a karaoke version of Garth Brooks' "The Dance."
"And now I'm glad I didn't know," the song goes, "the way it all would end the way it all would go." The song ends the guy's story line, but he could just as easily have been singing about the TV news business.
