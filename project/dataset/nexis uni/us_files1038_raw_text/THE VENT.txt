All last week the DOT's changeable message board I pass advised "Air Quality Alert --- Share the rice." Now that the rain has washed away some of the smog, can we get back to our normal eating habits?
That baby conceived two months after a vasectomy could still be yours. My doctor told me to be careful for six months after my surgery.
I am one of those heinous fiends who drive the speed limit.
Hey, Vent Guy, I've got 50 bucks that says you won't publish this.
Who are these people who stay up all night e-mailing me spam?
To the Wal-Mart cashier: Yes, these items are for my classroom. Research states that indirect lighting, plants and games help students perform better on tests.
If my cellphone provider charges me for every minute I talk to you and your cellphone provider does the same, aren't they getting paid double?
Most Yankees think my okra plants are marijuana.
I love my doctor. He has a sign in his waiting room that says, "Your doctor is on time," or 10 minutes or whatever, behind schedule. His business manager sees the drug reps. But I'm not telling you who my doctor is.
Now that I ride Cobb County Transit, I've gotten rid of my road rage. But cellphone rage is setting in!
What am I supposed to do when a child abduction alert interrupts my cable TV program? Search my house?
Possible bomb ingredients: makeup, bottled water, cream rinse, shampoo and cellphones. Who is running al-Qaida? MacGyver?
Another warning for alcoholic beverages: Consumption of alcohol causes members of the opposite sex to appear better looking than they actually are.
I love it that the TSA screeners are busting the women with gel inserts in their bras. Such acts of deception are a threat to mankind.
I thought about starting an exercise program, but then I pulled a muscle in my brain.
Warning that should be put on all alcoholic beverages: The consumption of alcohol may cause you to think you can sing.
One of my friends was kept waiting for 90 minutes in a doctor's office. He sued the doctor in small claims court for lost wages and was awarded $150. If more patients did this, I'll bet doctors would schedule more carefully.
Would you people, please dispense with the cellphone conversations while sitting on the toilet? Some of us need a quiet place.
When police arrived at the wreck scene in Texas, the surviving penguins were holding a vigil for their fallen partners, drinking Bud Ice and singing "Dooby Dooby Doo."
After three good years, Netflix customer service now ranks right up there with AOL's.
I saw Neal Boortz on television. Now I know why he's on radio.
Classmates.com, what have you done to me? Now I'm in love with the same two girls I loved in high school, 42 years ago.
My family should be very well-adjusted. We have six chiropractors in the family.
You all made me start reading Mary Worth and I hate it. Why is she being stalked by Captain Kangaroo?
Do stocks ever do anything other than soar or plunge?
My wife is a low-down cheat. This baby she soon will have was conceived two months after I had a vasectomy I never told her about.
What a great day for me! Two Vents published, plus I found out my husband's girlfriend is cheating on him.
If you do not know which lane on 78 is the turn lane, either stay off it altogether or don't make any left turns!
I found an entire case of bottled water in the trash, and when I asked my wife why she threw it out, she replied, "It's past its expiration date." Yep, she's blond.
