We don't always want to hear about the heartaches of others.
Maybe because if we get too close, we'll feel their pain - or we start to imagine how easily their misfortune could have been ours.
Nancy Guthrie, a publicist whose clients include Anne Graham Lotz, the daughter of the Rev. Billy Graham, and inspirational author Max Lucado, knows that her story can be hard to hear. She lost not one, but two children in infancy to an extremely rare congenital disorder. For a committed Christian woman, the tragedies were an affront to her faith and a challenge to her beliefs.
"I don't feel damaged, but I do feel altered," says Guthrie, who makes her home in Nashville, Tenn. "The person here now is different. There's been an amputation in my heart, and that hole will never be replaced."
A Parent's Nightmare
Three years ago, on the second day of her newborn daughter's life, Nancy got the news that any parent would dread: Her baby had a rare metabolic disorder called Zellweger syndrome.
There is no cure or treatment for the disease, which is characterized by the reduction or absence of cell structures that rid the body of toxic substances.
Life expectancy is, at best, about six months.
There was no way Guthrie or her husband, David, could have known they both carried this recessive gene. They had one healthy son, and all had gone smoothly during this pregnancy. The odds of two carriers meeting and having a child with the disorder is 1 in 100,000.
Hope Lauren lived 199 days. In that brief time, she was fed with a gastric tube to make feeding easier. She never learned to suck. She suffered seizures.
The chances of the Guthries having another child with the syndrome is 25 percent. Since they didn't want to ever endure such suffering again, David, a vice president at Word Music, underwent a vasectomy just three months after Hope's birth.
But again, the odds singled out the Guthries. Against 2,000-1 odds, Nancy learned nearly two years later that she was pregnant. Prenatal testing revealed this child, too, had Zellweger's syndrome.
Gabriel was born July 16, 2001. He lived one day short of six months.
New Take On Grief
As a publicist, Nancy is used to promoting authors and working behind the scenes. Now she's out front with her first book, "Holding on to Hope: A Pathway Through Suffering to the Heart of God" (Tyndale House Publishers, $11.99).
This is not just another book on a parent's grief.
"That's already been done," she says. Instead, Nancy's book grew out of her involvement with Bible Study Fellowship. She uses biblical principles to challenge the brokenhearted to work through their pain and emerge stronger.
She believes God prepared her for her own difficult journey. Just two weeks before Hope's birth, Nancy's Bible class was studying Job, a biblical figure whose sufferings are legendary. Nancy had no idea how she would later turn to Job in her darkest moments.
Nancy won't tell you the journey has been easy, even with her deep faith and a loving husband by her side. Like any human being, she has cried out, "Why me, God?" and didn't always find the comfort or the answers she was seeking.
Nancy and David got a bad deal, and they found the courage to work through it. Their story, inspired by a baby named Hope and a man named Job, is unforgettable.
