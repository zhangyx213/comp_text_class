If you believe media reports, teenage sex is at an all-time high. Maybe not, according to a national poll of 1,000 teens conducted by People magazine and NBC News. Twenty-seven percent of those surveyed said they have had intimate physical contact, but only 13 percent said they have had sexual intercourse. Just one in 10 said they have had oral sex. So what's fueling the anxiety over teen sex? The People/NBC poll and other interviews with parents and teens indicate that casual hookups are more common than parents would like to believe. Also, teens are much more candid about sex than previous generations. For more results, check out this week's People or "The 4-1-1: Teens & Sex," an NBC special with Katie Couric airing at 10 p.m. Wednesday.
  
* High notes: Rolling Stone (Jan. 27) looks back at the year in rock with its annual Readers' and Critics' Poll. The critics went with Jay-Z's "99 Problems" for best single and Kanye West's "College Dropout" for best album. Readers chose U2's "Vertigo" for single and "How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb" for album.

On a more serious note, economist Paul Krugman tells Rolling Stone's Eric Bates that Social Security is not in crisis. Krugman says President Bush's campaign to privatize Social Security is simply all about politics.
"Since the day of Barry Goldwater, the Republican right has really wanted to dismantle Social Security," Krugman says. "And now they have a degree of political dominance that lets them push it to the top of the agenda --- even though no rational analysis of the actual problems facing the U.S. government would say that it belongs there."
 
* Music and movies: Fade In, the quarterly movie magazine, features a cover story on Tom Cruise and an interview with Atlanta's Andre 3000 in its annual Oscar issue. Cruise discusses his role as a movie villain in "Collateral" and why he is not interested in winning awards. Andre 3000 is coy about the future of OutKast in the wake of his growing film career. "Well, I don't know how long the whole OutKast thing is going to go on. But I'll always do music in some kind of way."
Newsweek (Jan. 31) continues the movie theme with a roundtable interview with Hilary Swank, Jamie Foxx, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Paul Giamatti and Annette Bening about acting and the Oscars. Foxx says playing a well-known person like Ray Charles is a challenge because you don't want to just do an imitation. "You focus on the things the public didn't see --- how he answered the phone, how he talked to his kids," Foxx says. "I got a chance to videotape him, and when he wasn't being 'Ray Charles,' he was real subtle."
 
* Medical matters: U.S. News & World Report (Jan. 31) examines the future of medical care in the United States and determines that the next generation of healers may not be doctors at all. As the doctor shortage worsens, nurse practitioners and physician assistants are stepping in to fill the void. Turf wars are already being fought over the right for non-physicians to write prescriptions. Optometrists in Oklahoma are allowed to perform limited surgery, and podiatrists in California can do partial foot amputations.
 
* Quick reads: Southern Living (February) spotlights a number of Georgians, including Homer residents Nan and Dock Sisk. When they aren't officiating college basketball games, the Sisks spend their time restoring old farm buildings. . . . Conceive (spring), the magazine that addresses issues of fertility, visits some fertility-enhancing retreats where women have customized programs of diet, exercise and stress-reducing strategies. Other articles deal with insurance coverage for fertility treatments, reversing tubal ligations and vasectomies, and the proper weight to get pregnant. . . . In an essay in Esquire (February), Atlanta writer Tom Junod explains why the culture war in America is over. "After the election, a lot of liberals comforted themselves with the following argument: Politically, America may appear to be divided. Culturally, it enjoys an easygoing unanimity. No matter how Americans vote, they all watch 'Desperate Housewives.' "
