Benjamin, Robert Bedell Robert "Bob" Benjamin died April 15, 2020, in sunny San Diego, under the loving care of his daughters and hospice. He escaped the Corona-virus but died from compli-cations of a broken hip. Robert was born on July 4, 1924 and grew up in Pipestone Minnesota as the eldest child of Walter G. and Mabel Benjamin. He contracted and survived Polio, weathered the great Depression, and developed a life-long love of hard work and learning. 
At Hamline University in St. Paul, Minnesota, he earned a BA. His years there were interrupted by World War II. He became a Navy pilot and navigator and flew in the Pacific. Bob returned from service and married Betty Mae Waidelich on June 7, 1947. Betty supported the young couple while Robert attended medical school at University of Minnesota. They moved to Oregon for his Residency. After returning to Minnesota, Robert joined a small group practice, the St. Louis Park Medical Center. Over the course of his career he contributed to its expansion into a large health care provider. He mentored many young doctors, taught surgery at the University of Minnesota, authored books on surgery, and served on the board of the clinic. He believed that family planning was a basic right and became an expert in vasectomy surgery. He offered Thursday evening procedures so men could easily recover missing only one day of work. Along with their activism, Bob and Betty shared a zest for life. Bob built a wilderness cabin on the shore of Lake Superior. Later the isolated retreat was traded for a cabin on Madeline Island. Bob served on the Wilderness Preserve board there, as well as pursuing gardening, photography, chess, tennis, hiking and boating. Their love of travel took them around the globe. Many road trips included visits to friends and family. After Betty died, Bob married Cathy Coult. She shared his love of books, music, and travel until dementia overwhelmed her. Bob is survived by four siblings (Walter [& Majorie] Benjamin, Martha [& Willis] Unke, Roger [& Nancy] Benjamin, and Mary Louise [& Dale] Bowen), three children (Scott [& Ruth] Benjamin, Diane [& Matt] Uren, Laura [& Scott] Kopperud, eight grandchildren, and 12 great grandchildren, all of whom will miss his terrible jokes, great generosity, and wise advice.

Yates, Richard "Dick" May 7, 1931 to April 23, 2020 Dick was born Julius Riccardo Yates at the family home on Lincoln Street in Northeast Minneapolis. He was one of 16 children born to Italian immigrants Marie (Susie) Assunta Santillo and Pasquale (Pat) Antonio Yates. Dick was raised in and nurtured by NE Minneapolis, and he said he was lucky to be part of a large and culturally rich community. He was happy to spend the majority of his life within five miles from his home. After graduating from Edison High in 1950, Dick was drafted into the US Army and attended basic training at Ft. Benning, GA. He was deployed to Korea and served as a combat paratrooper with the 187th Airborne Infantry Regiment (Rakkasans). After returning home in November 1953, thanks to the GI Bill, Dick attended the University of Minnesota where he played football for the Gophers, and graduated in 1957. He married his best teammate, Fay Marcella Drier, on August 30, 1958. In 1967, they bought their home in the Kenny neighborhood of Southwest Minneapolis and raised four children. Dick had a 39 year career with the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board, where he oversaw playground programs at Longfellow and Lynnhurst Parks, and later, as Manager of Special Services, played a significant role in the expansion of Minneapolis parks and golf courses. He was always a sharp dresser and a terrible driver. Dick maintained lifelong friendships from each stop in his road of life. He is preceded in death by his parents and 13 siblings. He is survived by his sister Janet and brother David; loving wife of 62 years, Fay; children Brad (Jody), Bob, Doug (Chris), and Ann (Aaron); beloved grandchildren Jackson, Finn, Owen, and Vivian; and many loving nieces, nephews, and friends.
