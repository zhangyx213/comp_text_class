DR. LeROY CARHART never set out to be an abortion doctor, let alone a crusader for abortion rights. He would make an unlikely crusader for any cause: he spent 21 years in the Air Force, which paid his way through medical school, before retiring in 1985 as a lieutenant colonel. His last assignment was as chairman of the surgery department at the hospital at Offutt Air Force Base in Omaha, and because his children were happy there, Dr. Carhart, a New Jersey native, decided to stay in Omaha and open a medical practice.
Now 58, he is a father and grandfather, still married after 35 years to his sweetheart from junior high school in Trenton. Horses have been an abiding family interest; both Mary Carhart and the couple's daughter, Janine, ride competitively on the show circuit. Not too many years ago, before Dr. Carhart began helping out at a local abortion clinic and eventually opened one of his own, "I never would have put abortion on a list of the top 100 things I cared about," he said over dinner here on a recent evening.
But he is "stubborn, very stubborn," Mary Carhart said, and the stubbornness explains a lot. As much as anything else, it led him into federal court three years ago, after the Nebraska Legislature passed a law to ban the surgery it labeled "partial-birth abortion." To Dr. Carhart, the only doctor in Nebraska who performs abortions after 16 weeks of pregnancy, the law was "an affront to medical practice, putting the state in between the physician and the patient." He sued and won rulings, first from the Federal District Court in Omaha and then from the United States Court of Appeals in St. Louis, that the law placed an unconstitutional "undue burden" on a woman's right to an abortion.
The Supreme Court will hear Nebraska's appeal on April 25, and Dr. Carhart and his wife, who is his business partner, were in Washington to consult with their lawyers at the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy. The case is called Stenberg v. Carhart. Stenberg is Don Stenberg, Nebraska's attorney general.
As the sole plaintiff, LeRoy H. Carhart, M.D., will be forever linked to this chapter in the long legal struggle over abortion. In this, he is unusual. Few of the landmark abortion cases have individual plaintiffs' names attached. Jane Roe of Roe v. Wade kept her real name, Norma McCorvey, off the legal papers. The recent cases were filed under the names of abortion clinics, Reproductive Health Services in the 1989 case known as Webster, and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania in the Casey decision of 1992.
Dr. Carhart's clinic, in the Omaha suburb of Bellevue, is called Abortion and Contraceptive Clinic of Nebraska. The noneuphemistic name, uncommon in a field where "providers" perform "procedures" in places that sound like day spas, was a deliberate choice. Dr. Carhart does not like euphemisms.
"I named the clinic because abortion is a word, and it's not a four-letter word," he said. "I'm not trying to be abrasive, but a third of all women in America will have abortions during their lifetimes, and there's no reason not to say the word." (The actual figure, according to abortion statisticians, is over 40 percent).
Furthermore, Dr. Carhart said, "I have no trouble being called an abortionist," a word that is usually flung as a term of opprobrium at doctors who do abortions. The chief sponsor of the Nebraska law, State Senator David I. Maurstad, referred to Dr. Carhart as the "Bellevue abortionist," but if the word stung anyone, it missed its target. "I'm proud of it," Dr. Carhart said. "It should be a recognized medical speciality. We've allowed ourselves to be marginalized for too long."
He had performed vasectomies at a nearby abortion and reproductive health clinic when a former patient, working at the clinic as the nursing director, asked him if he would help with abortions. He hesitated because although he had learned to do abortions as part of his medical training at Hahnemann Medical College in Philadelphia -- under Pennsylvania's pre-Roe law, which permitted abortions at the discretion of hospital committees -- that had been years earlier.
But Dr. Carhart also remembered his rotation on the wards at Philadelphia General Hospital, where he saw dozens of women suffering from infections after abortions, usually self-induced, desperate acts. Some died and others were left sterile. "It was horrible, worse than watching people die in a war," he said.
Although there had been little occasion to think of abortion in the intervening years, when the issue presented itself, he had no question that safe abortions were an aspect of good medical care. In 1988, with abortion having been legal in America for 15 years, he took specialized training and joined the clinic staff. In 1991, he opened his own clinic.
THEN Dr. Carhart, for whom the debate on abortion was little more than an abstraction, came face to face with violence. Arsonists set fire to the horse farm where the Carharts lived, killing 17 of their 21 horses, as well as their pet dog and cat, and destroying their home. A letter the next day linked the horses' deaths to the "murder" caused by abortion. The apartment where the family moved was vandalized. A nurse at the clinic resigned after someone burned her garage.
"I just thought, if I let this get to me, they're going to know what it takes to get to me, and I'm not going to let that happen," Dr. Carhart said. "Women's health became my life."
When talk of banning something its opponents called "partial-birth abortion" first came up in Congress and state legislatures, he paid little attention. Nebraska had long prohibited abortions after the point of fetal viability, usually about 22 weeks of pregnancy, while both the rhetoric and the graphic images displayed during the legislative debates portrayed "partial-birth abortion" as the gruesome killing of babies near full-term delivery. "I just didn't see that it had anything to do with me," he said.
But when Nebraska passed its law, which carries a 20-year prison sentence, he decided that the language was broad enough to put doctors in peril for using common methods of pre-viability abortions. He was worried, then angry. The lower courts said he was right. Now the question is in the Supreme Court's hands.
