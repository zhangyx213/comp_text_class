A pair of proposed mergers that would leave all three Duluth hospitals connected to Roman Catholic health systems has raised concerns that infertility treatments, morning-after contraceptive pills and other services that violate church guidelines will be restricted.
     Talks are underway to merge the secular Miller-Dwan Medical Center with St. Mary's/Duluth Clinic Health System. The centerpiece of that system, St. Mary's Medical Center, is owned and operated by the Benedictine Health System.
     At the same time, St. Luke's Hospital and Regional Trauma Center, currently secular, is exploring a "50-50 partnership" with Ministry Health Care Corp.
     Ministry Health Care is a Wisconsin-based Catholic health system affiliated with the Sisters of the Sorrowful Mother.
   Partners in the proposed mergers say Miller-Dwan and St. Luke's will remain secular and will continue to provide all the services they have been, including morning-after contraception in the case of St. Luke's, which has an emergency room, and infertility treatment and sterilization procedures in the case of Miller-Dwan, which does not have an emergency room.
     Elective abortion hasn't been a central issue in the public debate because neither hospital has opted to perform them for some time. In Duluth, abortions are performed only at an independent women's clinic.
     But critics of the proposed mergers, including representatives of Planned Parenthood, retired doctors and ministers of other faiths, say they're uncomfortable with all three hospitals in the city being under the influence of the Catholic Church.
     They say that while St. Luke's and Miller-Dwan's administrators may intend to retain their autonomy, they could be pressured by a local bishop or even the Vatican into later curtailing services that run counter to Catholic doctrine.

A national issue
     They echo concerns raised in communities across the country where such mergers have occurred and, in some cases, patients immediately or eventually were denied vasectomies, tubal ligations, emergency contraception, condoms, in vitro fertilization and artificial insemination.
     Such procedures are banned by the Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services, compiled by the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. Certain research, such as that involving fetal tissue, also is forbidden.
     St. Mary's Medical Center adheres to those directives, and when it merged in the mid-1990s with the Duluth Clinic, the clinic's doctors were required to sign a statement that they would abide by the directives.
     The lone doctor who refused, psychiatrist William van Druten, lost his privileges to practice at the hospital. Van Druten, now retired, is tracking the proliferation of Catholic health system mergers nationwide and is among those opposed to the current merger plans.
     "It's un-American to impose one religious institution's restrictions on everybody," Van Druten said. "And it makes doctors agents of the Catholic Church."
     More than 200 people packed a public hearing about the Miller-Dwan merger Tuesday night. Most of the dozen or so speakers expressed reservations.
     Registered nurse Mary Riley, manager of Planned Parenthood's clinic in Duluth, said that St. Mary's emergency room has referred rape victims to Planned Parenthood rather than fulfill the victim's request for a morning-after pill, which prevents conception. She said she fears that the other hospitals will follow suit if they have Catholic affiliation.
     Dr. Peter Person, chief executive at St. Mary's/Duluth Clinic, responded that St. Mary's policy is to provide such emergency treatment to rape victims unless they are already pregnant. "We have to be careful not to do abortions," he said.
     Shirley Levine, representing the Temple Israel synagogue in Duluth, drew loud applause when she said: "We need at least one truly secular hospital. It is necessary to respect those of us with other beliefs."
     Several people asked how Miller-Dwan can guarantee it won't be pressured into complying with the Catholic directives later.
    "We expect to have a contract; we intend for it to be more than a promise," responded the hospital's attorney, Jay Christiansen.
     In an interview Wednesday, St. Luke's CEO John Strange took a similar stance. "We will not negotiate away the services we are providing now," he said. "We will not reduce or stop the services that are available to the women and patients of our region."
     Strange acknowledged that St. Luke's recently wrote a policy formalizing its long-standing practice of refusing to perform abortions, but he said the policy has nothing to do with the partnership talks with Ministry Health Care that began last spring.
     Asked what's driving so many hospital mergers, Strange said hospitals are "under siege" because of low state and federal reimbursement rates, a shrinking supply of capital financing and difficulty in recovering costs from insurers under managed care.
     Finding a partner can be the only way to get access to capital for improvements, he said. An increasing number of struggling hospitals are finding partners who happen to be Catholic, according MergerWatch, a national family-planning organization that's tracking the trend.
    Sister Kathleen Hofer, chief executive at St. Mary's in Duluth, was in meetings Wednesday afternoon and not available for comment, a spokeswoman said.
