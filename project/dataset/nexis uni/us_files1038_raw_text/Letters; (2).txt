 Motive is always money
I see that Gov. Jeb Bush wants to go ahead with deregulation of power generation (Florida Metro,  March 29). Does he really expect us to believe that Florida will be any different from California?  Does he want us to believe that private companies will jump in and build power plants so we can  have cheaper electrical rates? That's like saying Time Warner is going to lower cable rates because  it wants people to enjoy cable TV at a reasonable price.
The private power companies will just sit back and wait until the need for power goes up and  then raise the rates because the demand is high. The only thing I see is that Bush has friends in  the power business. After the rates go up out of sight for reasons he can't understand, he will be  out of office and will probably head back to Texas, where they don't have those problems.  - BRUCE N. GOGOLIN  Tampa  Fees as high as the moon
It is fairly clear that some restitution is required for the Aisenbergs and their lawyers,  although the whereabouts of baby Sabrina still remains unsolved (Florida Metro, March 27).
But one gets very tired of hearing about lawyers reaching for the moon as their "normal" payment.  Lawyers expecting $ 3 million to $ 4 million for their work must be charging almost $ 10,000 an hour -  which would be laughable if it weren't so outrageous.  - WILLIAM H. RIDDELL  Tampa  Forgetting other benefits
Regarding "Welcome to the Army" (BayLife, March 26):
Once again, an article stated that 5,000 military families are on food stamps. The implication  is that the military is to blame despite ever-increasing pay for its members.
According to the obviously conservative Wall Street Journal, the quoted number of soldiers on  food stamps is often inflated. Furthermore, almost all of those qualifying for food stamps receive  them because of the arcane formula the government uses in determining eligibility. All those  benefits - housing, food, cost of living, etc. - are not factored into the equation. I maintain if  they were, almost no soldier would qualify. All income - whatever its source - should be counted.
I suggest the Tribune interview a few military families receiving assistance to determine if the  food stamps are really necessary. I would also suggest interviewing food stamp personnel to  determine why untaxed benefits are not considered income, thus artificially inflating the number  who qualify. And to those GIs who have discovered they have fathered more children than they can  feed, may I recommend a procedure called a vasectomy? It's another one of your untaxed benefits.  - JOHN E. BALCOME  Clearwater  Thank you and farewell
On the morning of March 18, while most of us were in church, a drug counselor for the Tampa  Metro Treatment Center was tragically killed during an attempted robbery (Florida Metro, March 20).  Sergio Guedes was his name. This senseless act ended the life of this husband and father of three.
Well-liked by his colleagues and appreciated by many of the patients who attended the clinic,  Guedes served the community for six years. Sergio aided and counseled drug abusers in their fight  to break the habit. This man gave his life at this endeavor. Like many other civil servants, he  laid his life down for what he believed. As a member of the cross-section of middle America, I am  unaware of the effect of this man's job on mine - at least until some drug-crazed addict is robbing  my home to feed his drug addiction. This man left his wife, who is unemployed, to tend a  now-fatherless family. As would be the norm with a downed law enforcement or other civil servant,  the community should look to assist this woman in her time of need. Somehow we might be able then  to say "Thank you, Sergio."
To make donations to the family contact the Tampa Metro Treatment Center at (813) 980-3354.  - ROD DAVID  Tampa
