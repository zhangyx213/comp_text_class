For years, Brazil's government has gotten into the Carnival spirit by handing out tens of millions of free condoms on the streets.
Now the world's largest Roman Catholic country is helping to make birth control pills more affordable, subsidizing a program that will allow people to buy a year's supply for just $2.40.
Weeks after Pope Benedict XVI used a five-day visit to Brazil to denounce government-backed contraception efforts, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva announced the new program to give masses of poor Brazilians access to birth control pills that the better-off take for granted.
"It gives them the same right that the wealthy have to plan the number of children they want," Silva said Monday.
Brazil already hands out free birth control pills at government-run pharmacies. But many poor people in Latin America's largest country don't go to those pharmacies, so Silva's administration decided to offer the pills at drastically reduced prices at private drugstores, said Health Minister Jose Gomes Temporao.
Under the new program, anyone can buy the pills by simply showing a government-issued identification card that almost all Brazilians carry. The number of outlets selling the pills will start at 3,500 and is expected to rise to 10,000 by the end of this year.
When the $51 million program is fully under way, the government expects to be handing out 50 million packages of birth control pills each year.
Each government-subsidized package - with enough pills to last a month - will cost 20 cents. They now retail for $2.56 to $25.60.
The Health Ministry said it does not plan to subsidize condoms at private drugstores, but Brazil already distributes 254 million free condoms per year, many as part of an anti-AIDS program, with a special push just before the nation's Carnival celebrations.
Temporao also said the government plans to increase the number of free vasectomies performed at state hospitals.
