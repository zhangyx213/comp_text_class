Not his son
 With ratings flagging for "The Osbournes," a new cast member may be just what the "reality" show needs.
 But Ozzy Osbourne isn't willing for his family to include Sheron Lutz's 6-year-old son, reports the New York Daily News. Lutz claims Osbourne is the father.
"Ozzy, who had a vasectomy 17 years ago, has no idea who this woman is and has no intention of making any payment," says his spokeswoman.
 House guest
 While Ozzy Osbourne won't be welcoming any little ones into his home, he is extending an invitation to Prince William to come stay at his Beverly Hills mansion.
 "I've been told you want to come and live in America. You're more than welcome to come and live in my house," Osbourne says. "My daughter would be thrilled. My wife would. I would. And the dogs would!"
 Thanks for the memory
 Kid Rock as the new Bob Hope?
 Fresh off a USO tour in Iraq, the Kid is singing the praises of American troops there.
 "It was just unbelievable to be there and have the sense of kind of what was really important in life, like a respect, an appreciation for the people who were there putting their life at risk for our way of life, our country," he says.
 Kid Rock arrived at a military hangar in Baghdad with John Stamos and his wife, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, expecting to just sign autographs. But when the thousands of troops started cheering him on, he gave an impromptu concert, using instruments on stage designated for a military band.
 BET picks the best
 50 Cent continues to dominate the hip-hop scene. The rapper was named best new artist and best male hip-hop artist at the third annual BET Awards ceremony.
 Other winners included Missy "Misdemeanor" Elliott for best female hip-hop artist, Yolanda Adams for best gospel artist, R&B quartet B2K for best group, Queen Latifah for best actress and Derek Luke for best actor. R. Kelly tied with Jaheim for best male R&B artist with India.Arie, above, named best female R&B artist.
 Tennis star Serena Williams was best female athlete, Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers was best male athlete.
 Cash forges ahead
 Johnny Cash says it's painful to play without his wife, June Carter Cash, who died last month, but adds that getting back onstage is "a healing thing." Carter Cash died May 15 after heart surgery. She would have been 74 on Monday.
 "The pain is so severe, there is no way of describing it," the 71-year-old singer says.
 Cornering the market
 Steven Cojocaru is adding another job to his resume.
 The People magazine's West Coast style editor and NBC's "Today" show regular is joining "Entertainment Tonight." Beginning in August, he'll do celebrity interviews, monitor pop-culture trends and provide fashion commentary for the syndicated TV show.
 "I'm in L.A. and New York on a weekly basis, and I think that was attractive to 'ET' -- that I can be in two places at the same time," Cojocaru says.
