A study out today refutes the long-held notion that tubal ligation
-- the nation's most popular birth control method -- can cause
menstrual irregularities.
Tubal ligation, also referred to as having your tubes tied, uses
various methods to block the fallopian tubes connecting the ovaries
to the uterus.
More than 10 million women in the USA and more than 100 million
women worldwide have had their tubes tied, says lead author Herbert
Peterson, former chief of the women's health and fertility branch
at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For nearly
20 years, Peterson has led a study looking at whether tubal sterilization
affects health.
The first report linking tubal ligation to heavy periods and between-period
spotting appeared 50 years ago, Peterson and his co-authors note
in The New England Journal of Medicine. Ever since, doctors
have debated whether "post-tubal-ligation syndrome" exists.
Subsequent research showing that women who had their tubes tied
were more likely to have a hysterectomy was seen as evidence that
they had more menstrual problems.
Peterson's team studied 9,514 women getting tubal ligations in
nine U.S. cities. The researchers compared them with 573 women
whose husbands were getting vasectomies. Such women were chosen
for comparison because they wouldn't be using hormonal birth control,
which can affect the menstrual cycle.
All of the women were asked the same questions about six characteristics
of their menstrual cycles. The women were interviewed before they
or their husbands were sterilized and annually for up to five
years.
If the women had been pregnant, breast-feeding or on the pill,
any of which can affect the menstrual cycle, they were asked about
their last "natural" cycle before the sterilization.
The sterilized women were no more likely to report persistent
changes in bleeding between their periods or in the length of
their cycles.
In some ways, they appeared to fare better than the others. They
were more likely to report decreases in the number of days of
bleeding, the amount of bleeding and menstrual pain. Only in cycle
regularity did they appear to do less well.
Peterson says there are no known reasons for differences in menstrual
patterns between the groups. They may have been the result of
chance, he says, or they may have reflected unknown differences.
Sterilized women may be more likely to have a hysterectomy because
of their preference for the finality of surgical solutions, Peterson
says.
The study's key message is that menstrual abnormalities are common,
says Peterson, now at the World Health Organization.
In an accompanying editorial, Carolyn Westhoff of New York's Columbia
University calls the findings "broadly reassuring."
