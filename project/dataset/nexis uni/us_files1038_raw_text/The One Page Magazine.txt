THE BIG PROFILE
CONNIE NIELSEN
Connie Nielsen's first acting gig was doing sketch comedy with her mother in her hometown in Denmark. ''I was just absolutely petrified every night I went out on that stage,'' she said, but she kept at it. ''I'm very resilient, and I'm also super-stubborn.'' The fear eventually subsided, and Nielsen now stars in ''The Following'' on Fox. Still, having jitters ''inserts a little bit of energy into what you're doing,'' she said. ''I don't want to be absolutely, 100 percent certain of anything.''
JEALOUSY, MY DEAR WATSON
This season, the British TV series ''Sherlock'' introduces Mary Morstan, who marries Sherlock Holmes's sidekick, Dr. John Watson, in the original stories by Arthur Conan Doyle and in the show. Some fans, fearing that she could threaten the intensity of Watson's on-screen relationship with Holmes, turned on Amanda Abbington, who plays Morstan, even sending her death threats. They might get their wish, sort of. Morstan dies in the books -- but then Watson apparently remarries.
TOUCH 'N' GO
Residents of Madison, Wis., were once able to drop $60 for an hour of cuddling, spooning and hugging by a ''professional snuggler'' at the Snuggle House. But the operation was shut down after less than a month by its owner, Matthew Hurtado, who felt that it was receiving undue scrutiny from law enforcement, which suspected it was a front for prostitution. Hurtado maintains that the touching is therapeutic and nonsexual, and -- as if to prove his point ­ -- even offered discounts to the elderly.

TOO SOON?
BY PETER ANDREY SMITH
Peter McGraw, a psychologist who studies humor, recently took a serious look at a Twitter account cracking wise about Hurricane Sandy. He found a comedic ''sweet spot'' about four to five weeks after the disaster -- enough time to create a buffer but not so much time that the jokes became irrelevant. But, he warns, ''when you fail, you're likely to offend.''
WHAT I'M DRINKING
BY MARIO BATALI
In the depths of winter, choucroute garni is one of my Sunday staples. According to wine geeks all over, Alsatian dry riesling is the pairing of choice. But upon further tasting, I realized that my favorite beverage to drink with sauerkraut and sausages is ice-cold beer -- especially Fischer's Bière de Noël, a Vienna-style lager that has a hint of tangerine and spice that perfectly matches the rich juniper-scented sourness of the kraut.

JUDGE JOHN HODGMAN RULES
Evelyn WRITES: My husband's snoring is incredibly loud and constant. He has tried mouth guards, but they do not work. I would like him to have an outpatient procedure to stiffen his soft palate and diminish his snoring. Like a vasectomy, it affects us both but should ultimately be his choice. He seems amenable but has not made any progress on it. You are creating a dispute where there is none. Your husband is ''amenable'' to the procedure, and your need is clearly desperate. For wasting this court's time, I am inclined to order you to get him a snore- AND vas-ectomy. But the court will be lenient with regard to the latter, as you have saved me, a snorer, from having to try mouth guards.

HOW TO ABANDON SELF-CONTROL
Instead of trying to regulate something, give it up all together. I got this idea from a biography of Samuel Johnson. Someone offers wine to Johnson, and Johnson turns it down, saying, ''Abstinence is as easy to me as temperance would be difficult.''
As told to Spencer Bailey
