- Some Minnesotans despise the film "Fargo" for the way it portrays our citizens.
Don't let these folks see "Let's Bowl" (7 p.m. COM), which goes even further in establishing our yahoo status. The locally produced comedy kicks off its second season with a bowling game between a couple fighting about a vasectomy. Between rolls, there are plenty of Minnesota references _ like them or not.
     - HBO will begin the rebroadcast of the Golden Globe-winning 10-part miniseries based on the Stephen Ambrose bestseller "Band of Brothers" at 8 p.m.
