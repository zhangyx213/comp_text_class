BOARD UNANIMOUS IN SUPPORT OF PLAN
By ELLEN GEDALIUS

TAMPA — Hillsborough County Commissioner Ronda Storms wants state legislation that would allow courts to order tubal ligation or vasectomies for adults who abuse children.
She is motivated by a November newspaper column that outlines the death of Bradley McGee, a 2-year-old from Lakeland who was murdered by his stepfather 15 years ago while his mother watched.
Since then, according to the column, his mother has regained custody of another son.
Storms' discussion of tubal ligation and vasectomies came a day after reports about Ronnie Bernard Paris Jr. being charged with first-degree murder and aggravated child abuse in the death of his son.
"How much more?" Storms asked. "How can we not try?"
Commissioners voted 7-0 to support legislation that would keep child abusers from having more children.
State Rep. Ed Homan, R-Tampa, chairman of the Hillsborough County legislative delegation, could not be reached Wednesday.
Storms first floated the idea at a delegation meeting in January, but legislators did not offer support or disapproval.
Commissioners also voted to consult with Manuel Menendez Jr., chief judge for Hillsborough County courts, on the matter.
Reporter Ellen Gedalius can be reached at (813) 259-7679.
