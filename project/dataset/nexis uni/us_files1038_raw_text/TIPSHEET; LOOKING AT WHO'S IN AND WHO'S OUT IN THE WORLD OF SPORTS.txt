He wants his money's worth
Did you catch that little scuffle Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant got into with New York Knicks guard Chris Childs?
It cost Bryant one game's pay, a stiff $ 109,756, plus another $ 5,000 in an NBA fine. For that kind of money, he'd like to get a few more punches in before getting grabbed.
"I don't really like to fight that much, you know what I mean?" Bryant said. "But if you get to that point where you want to fight, fight! Don't just punch and run. That was frustrating."
Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal figures players should get free retaliation when somebody swings at them. "They should give us a two-punch retaliation deal," Shaq said. "He hits you first, you get the bing-bing. When guys get hit like that, I don't know what else you're supposed to do."
Spoken like a true hockey fan. Did Bryant believe Childs was trying to get him out of the game with an altercation?
 
"I don't think so," Bryant sniffed. "I don't think he's that smart."
 
Mysteries of the universe
Questions to ponder while wondering why that pompous Billy Packer keeps cracking about the NBA:
 
* What does Packer have against Florida guard Teddy Dupay?
* Going back into the championship game seemed like a good idea at the time, but do you suppose Mateen Cleaves' ankle is barking at him today?
* Did Steve Mariucci teach his buddy Tom Izzo the West Coast offense to go over the top of that Florida press?
 
Finally, a good excuse
Sometimes, boxers pull out of bouts for purely fictional reasons. But trainer Mike Acri came up with a good excuse for yanking Razor Ruddock out of his bout with WBO champion Vitaly Klitschko.
"Razor had an operation to reverse a vasectomy a few weeks ago, and he got hit low in sparring and the guy was in agony," HBO's Lou DiBella said. Ruddock "had a bulge in his abdomen and nobody knew what it was. They were afraid he had cancer. So he got an MRI, and it turned out there was an infection. Obviously, he couldn't fight. As excuses go, it was one of the better ones I've heard. It's so embarrassing to the poor guy, he couldn't be lying."
Klitschko lost the title bout to Ruddock's replacement, American Chris Byrd.
 
A tough adjustment
Jumping from college ball to the NBA is a challenge, regardless of how easy a few superstars make it seem. For instance, Mikki Moore of the Detroit Pistons made this statement in a radio interview: "We have to play hard for the full 40 minutes."
When told that NBA games are actually 48 minutes long, Moore said: "Forty-eight? Oh, that's right. Twelve-minute quarters."

"Questions to Ponder While Removing Brian McRae From Your Fantasy Team:
* "Did Brian Holzinger's hit on Pavol Demitra serve as Tampa Bay's revenge for the NFC Championship?
* "Will ex-Rangers coach John Muckler go back to working as a body double for Peter Graves?"
 
Megaphone
"I don't look at it too long. Man, when you look at yourself when you're alive, that's scary."

Words to live by
"If you have an egg and you boil it, and if you want to have it back fresh, it's impossible."
