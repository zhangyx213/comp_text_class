\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Stettler didn\u8217 t know it at the time, but the website that she stumbled across represents a new front in the abortion wars, part of the anti-abortion movement\u8217 s decades-long insistence on women\u8217 s indecision, ignorance and regret around their abortion decisions. When the abortion pill became available in the United States in 2000, 12 years after it was approved in France, activists on both sides of the debate predicted that what was then called RU-486 would revolutionize the abortion landscape. One Planned Parenthood medical director told a journalist in the late 1990s that he expected medication abortions to make up 30 percent of all abortions within three or four years. Anti-abortion leaders, meanwhile, foresaw the procedure\u8217 s becoming effectively invisible, and therefore difficult to confront directly. George W. Bush, then the Republican nominee for president, said he feared the new protocol would \u8216 \u8216 make abortions more and more common.\u8217 \u8217 }
{\rtlch\afs24\ltrch\fs24\par}\pard\plain\itap0\s0\fi0\sb200\sa0\aspalpha\aspnum\adjustright\ltrpar\li0\lin0\ri0\rin0\qj\faauto\sl260\slmult0\rtlch\afs24\ltrch\fs24{\rtlch\af2\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\b0\i0\fs20\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033
\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Neither prediction proved true. A graph of the abortion rate since Roe v. Wade in 1973 looks something like a long playground slide viewed from the side. There\u8217 s a steep climb up to the peak of 1981, and then a gentle but significant slope downward. In 2014, the number of abortions in the United States dropped below one million for the first time since 1975. Nor did medication abortion immediately transform how those dwindling numbers of abortions were administered. A decade after RU-486\u8217 s arrival in the United States, fewer than 18 percent of abortions took place via medication, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Even among women whose pregnancies were eligible for the abortion pill \u8212  at the time, eight weeks\u8217  gestation or less \u8212  almost three-quarters underwent surgery instead.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 As public discussion about abortions has focused on surgical abortions, the anti-abortion movement has notched victory after victory, chipping away at abortion access through a constellation of state laws that heavily regulate clinics, starve providers of funds and require women to undergo \u8216 \u8216 counseling\u8217 \u8217  or waiting periods before procuring the procedure. As a result, at least 162 abortion providers closed or stopped offering the service between 2011 and 2016, according to a Bloomberg analysis, while just 21 new providers opened. In the Midwest and the South, more than half of all women live in counties with no abortion provider at all.}

American women now end their pregnancies with medication almost as often as they do with surgery, according to data analyzed last fall by Reuters. And last year, the Food and Drug Administration issued new label guidelines making the abortion pill more accessible than ever. Mifepristone is now recommended up to a gestational age of 10 weeks; the new guidelines also reduced the number of required doctor visits and the recommended dosage. The experience of taking a few pills in private is on the cusp of becoming what we mean when we say \u8216 \u8216 abortion.\u8217 \u8217 }

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 This steady rise of medication abortion, or what the anti-abortion movement calls chemical abortion, presents the movement with a significant challenge, one that has turned out to be more complicated than the fear that abortion would become more common. \u8216 \u8216 They\u8217 ve consistently lost the debate when the debate has been over the status of human life immediately after conception,\u8217 \u8217  says the historian Daniel K. Williams, author of the 2016 book \u8216 \u8216 Defenders of the Unborn: The Pro-Life Movement Before Roe v. Wade.\u8217 \u8217  Medication abortions take place relatively early in pregnancy, and they are eliminating many of the images and narratives \u8212  the abortionist\u8217 s instruments, the impersonal clinic \u8212  that have historically served as persuasive scare tactics. \u8216 \u8216 We haven\u8217 t really thought through these things all that carefully, and we\u8217 re still fighting, with good reason, the battle over surgical abortion,\u8217 \u8217  says Charles Camosy, the anti-abortion author of the 2015 book \u8216 \u8216 Beyond the Abortion Wars: A Way Forward for a New Generation.\u8217 \u8217  \u8216 \u8216 With chemical abortion, we\u8217 re not where we need to be.\u8217 \u8217 }

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 What the anti-abortion movement has thought through carefully is how to tell stories about abortion\u8217 s impact. Early activists, who were mostly Catholics, were almost solely concerned with saving the life of the fetus. Feminists arguing for choice, in turn, made a convincing case for their own rights \u8212  and accused people opposed to abortion of not caring about women at all. In the years after Roe v. Wade, however, some of the millions of women who procured newly legal abortions began to complicate that conflict by speaking publicly about their own experiences and emotions, including their regrets. Anti-abortion activists founded \u8216 \u8216 abortion recovery\u8217 \u8217  organizations and advanced the idea of \u8216 \u8216 post-abortion syndrome,\u8217 \u8217  a relative, they claimed, of post-traumatic stress disorder. By the 1990s, emphasizing abortion\u8217 s supposed harms to women had become a full-fledged strategy, one that changed both the public face of the anti-abortion movement and its self-identity. Today many young anti-abortion activists frame their work as feminist; the theme of last year\u8217 s March for Life was \u8216 \u8216 Pro-Life and Pro-Woman Go Hand in Hand.\u8217 \u8217  Promoting abortions as murder had always carried the uncomfortable implication that the women who procured them were killers. In the revised narrative, \u8216 \u8216 the women are viewed as essentially victims,\u8217 \u8217  Williams says. \u8216 \u8216 The argument is always that they didn\u8217 t have the knowledge they really needed.\u8217 \u8217 }

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 And \u8216 \u8216 abortion pill reversal\u8217 \u8217  implies exactly that \u8212  that a woman made an uninformed decision and has now thought better of it. The brainchild of a San Diego doctor named George Delgado, \u8216 \u8216 reversal\u8217 \u8217  is a medical protocol that floods a woman\u8217 s body with progesterone, the so-called pregnancy hormone, within hours after she has taken mifepristone, the drug that begins a medication abortion. \u8216 \u8216 If you have something that\u8217 s poisoned a specific spot in your body and we know what the antidote is, then you just take the antidote,\u8217 \u8217  says Dr. Donna Harrison, executive director of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which has enthusiastically promoted reversal to its members. For all the challenges that the abortion pill poses to the anti-abortion movement, it turns out to have at least one unexpected benefit: The hours between the two doses of medication represent an extra decision point to interrupt and redeem. \u8216 \u8216 With a surgical abortion, once the instrument enters the uterus, then it\u8217 s over,\u8217 \u8217  Delgado says. Medication abortion, by contrast, gives women \u8216 \u8216 a second chance at choice.\u8217 \u8217 }

The document, written in 1968 at the height of the sexual revolution, is a holistic statement on the sacredness of all human life, from conception to death. It also firmly restated the church\u8217 s teaching against most forms of birth control.

Was there any way to undo her mistake? By this time, Delgado had been using progesterone for years to treat women dealing with fertility issues. And he knew that mifepristone, the first drug in the abortion-pill protocol, works by blocking progesterone from the uterus. Couldn\u8217 t an extra dose of progesterone overcome the mifepristone? Within hours, he sketched out a plan to inject the woman with 200 milligrams of progesterone and to con\'adtinue giving the progesterone until the end of the first trimester.

They soon published a small case series in the journal Annals of Pharmacotherapy. The article, just four pages long, describes seven pregnancies treated with progesterone after mifepristone. Two of the abortions completed, but four of the fetuses survived. (One woman evaded the doctors\u8217  attempts to follow up.) \u8216 \u8216 The experience of these patients suggests that medical abortion can be arrested by progesterone injection,\u8217 \u8217  Davenport and Delgado concluded. \u8216 \u8216 If further trials confirm the success without complications of this or similar protocols, it should become the standard of care for obstetrician-gynecologists, family physicians and emergency-department physicians to attempt mifepristone reversal on patient request.\u8217 \u8217 }

But the volume increased over the years: 200 calls in 2013, more than 400 in 2014 and more than 600 for each of the last two years, according to the reversal program\u8217 s executive director, Sara Littlefield. Today 17 nurses across the country take shifts answering the calls, which are routed to their cellphones. When a call comes into the hotline, the nurse\u8217 s job is to connect the caller as quickly as possible with a local doctor willing to administer the reversal protocol. The program has a network of about 350 doctors who are familiar with it and prepared to see patients. If the caller doesn\u8217 t live within driving range of one of those providers, the hotline nurse immediately starts calling local doctors and hospitals to explain what reversal is, hoping to find a sympathetic provider. Catholic hospitals are usually a good place to start.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 A vanishingly small percentage of women decide they want to reverse a medication abortion halfway through. In fact, regret is quite rare when it comes to abortions in general. A 2013 study found that although women experienced a wide range of often conflicting responses to the procedure, relief was the most common emotion one week after. A later study found that women who had abortions were also confident in their decisions beforehand \u8212  more confident than people who decide to get reconstructive knee surgery, for example. \u8216 \u8216 Most women are certain of their decision when they present for care,\u8217 \u8217  says the study\u8217 s lead author, Lauren Ralph, an epidemiologist at the Univer\'adsity of California, San Francisco. Their certainty is largely unchanged by waiting periods and mandated counseling, which suggests \u8216 \u8216 women do not change their minds.\u8217 \u8217  Ralph also found that women who do experience uncer\'adtainty are more likely to already believe a myth about abortion, such as that it causes breast cancer.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Women who regret their abortions, and are willing to speak publicly about it, have long been valued spokeswomen for the anti-abortion message. But reversal offers a twist to those stories: a happy ending. It also represents a concrete action that women can take to atone for their initial mistake. \u8216 \u8216 This gives them the actual physical way in which they can in effect reverse their regret,\u8217 \u8217  says Jody Lyne\'e9 Madeira, a professor at Indiana University Maurer School of Law who has written about the rhetoric of abortion and regret. \u8216 \u8216 She can say she did everything she can to stop it once she changed her mind.\u8217 \u8217 }

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 For all of reversal\u8217 s anecdotal power, however, the science itself is still disputed. While Delgado claims that flooding a woman\u8217 s body with progesterone saves the fetus, other doctors say that in many cases the fetus would have survived if the woman simply declined to take the second pill, misoprostol, after the initial dose of mifepristone. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists issued a strongly worded statement against reversal in 2015 that said the fetus would survive 30 to 50 percent of the time. Dr. Daniel Grossman, a prominent reversal skeptic and director of the research group Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health, at University of California, San Francisco, published a literature review that same year in the journal Contraception. He concluded Delgado and Davenport\u8217 s case series was of \u8216 \u8216 poor quality with few details,\u8217 \u8217  and that embryonic survival after mifepristone is as high as 46 percent. The question, in other words, is whether the progesterone protocol is effectively just a placebo. \u8216 \u8216 There\u8217 s no evidence that any kind of treatment is better than doing nothing,\u8217 \u8217  Grossman says.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Davenport, Delgado and Matthew Harrison recently published their own literature review in Issues in Law & Medicine, a journal that often features anti-abortion perspectives. When they looked at studies in which the mifepristone dose was comparable to the current F.D.A. regulations, they found survival rates of less than 25 percent. Delgado and Davenport are also preparing a larger case series for publication later this year, which they say will include about 350 women. Delgado says it shows that the most effective progesterone protocol results in an embryo survival rate between 60 and 70 percent. No one has seen that research yet, although conservative media outlets have recently started promoting the results. Critics say that even if those numbers are valid, they aren\u8217 t what they seem. Many women who decide to take progesterone undergo an ultrasound first, to see if the pregnancy remains viable; those whose fetuses have died do not go forward with reversal, which means the initial pool of subjects is skewed toward women whose pregnancies had a good chance of continuing even without progesterone. Delgado declined to share a draft of his paper and told me he couldn\u8217 t reveal the percentage of women included in the case series who underwent ultrasounds.}

But if one of his daughters came to him and said she had somehow accidentally taken mifepristone during pregnancy, he said, he would tell her to take 200 milligrams of progesterone three times a day for several days, just long enough for the mifepristone to leave her system: \u8216 \u8216 I bet you it would work.\u8217 \u8217  The protocol, however, has attracted almost no interest from the mainstream medical community, in part because the presumed audience is so small.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 But while Delgado and his associates labor to legitimize reversal, some state lawmakers are racing ahead of them. Since 2015, legislators in 10 states have introduced bills requiring doctors to inform women procuring the abortion pill that they can change their minds after taking the first dose. \u8216 \u8216 These laws are essentially forcing physicians to tell their patients about a treatment that is unproven and essentially kind of encouraging them to participate in an unmonitored research experiment,\u8217 \u8217  Grossman says. In Utah, Gov. Gary Herbert signed a bill in March that requires women receiving the pill to be informed that mifepristone alone does not always end a pregnancy; a similar law went into effect in South Dakota last year. Arkansas requires women to be informed that \u8216 \u8216 it may be possible to reverse the effects of the abortion if the pregnant woman changes her mind.\u8217 \u8217  A 2015 Arizona law passed but was then revised to strip its mention of reversal. Similar bills were debated in Colorado, California, Indiana, Idaho, North Carolina and Georgia. Americans United for Life, an influential lobbying group, flagged its model legislation on reversal as a strategic focus for 2017.}

Stettler struggled with grief and guilt for months. After her due date, she attended a retreat for \u8216 \u8216 post-abortive\u8217 \u8217  women run by a Christian ministry, which included a memorial service presided over by a priest. Stettler played the piano and sang an original song she had written for the baby, who she decided was a girl and named Remy. \u8216 \u8216 True joy is never found in the things we love in passing,\u8217 \u8217  she sang. \u8216 \u8216 But in a sacrifice so pure, we find love everlasting.\u8217 \u8217 }

She started volunteering for the hotline, talking to women in the same position she was once in. And in March, she moved to San Diego to start working full time as the nurse manager at Culture of Life. She sees the work she does now as something like atonement. \u8216 \u8216 I knew that Remy\u8217 s life had to stand for something,\u8217 \u8217  she told me.

Some legal experts predicted the ruling would force the anti-abortion movement to refocus its attention from the mother\u8217 s health and emotions, back to the fetus itself. But reversal legislation suggests the anti-abortion movement isn\u8217 t giving up so fast. In fact, the movement seems to be \u8216 \u8216 doubling down on the emphasis on women,\u8217 \u8217  says Mary Ziegler, a law professor at Florida State University and author of the 2015 book \u8216 \u8216 After Roe: The Lost History of the Abortion Debate.\u8217 \u8217  Stories from individual women who struggle with remorse remain a powerful weapon in the anti-abortion arsenal, and the abortion rights movement has often stumbled in its attempts to respond. \u8216 \u8216 Because there are so many stories that the pro-choice side wants to represent and has to represent, to cover its bases, it sounds weaker and less coherent than pro-life \u8216 abortion harms women, women regret abortion,\u8217 \u8201 \u8217 \u8217  Madeira says. \u8216 \u8216 That cohesive message is always much stronger and more unified.\u8217 \u8217 }
