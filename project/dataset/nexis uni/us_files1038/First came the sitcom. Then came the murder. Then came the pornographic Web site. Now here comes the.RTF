He would be remembered, if he was remembered at all, as the star of "Hogan's Heroes," a hit CBS comedy that ran from 1965 to 1971 and was set in a P.O.W. camp during World War II. As the star of "Hogan's Heroes," Crane enjoyed the same kind of fame as Gilligan or Greg Brady -- his character became part of America's collective pop-culture nostalgia. Embalmed by syndication, Crane would have been the wisecracking Hogan forever. But in the years since his death in 1978, when the porno pictures started surfacing in the tabloids and his secrets began to unravel, Crane became infamous. And in the age of "Behind the Music" and "The Osbournes," decadence and self-destruction make for the best kind of celebrity. }

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2      Crane's story conforms to the increasingly cynical formula of modern stardom: uncontrollable urges plus a precipitous decline equals mass appeal. Starting in the late 60's, he began making videotapes of himself in sexual encounters. He became more and more obsessed with documenting his conquests, and the precarious balance of his life between work, family and sex tipped heavily in the direction of sex. Crane's dreams of being a leading man in the movies never materialized; he ended up performing in dinner theater. His sex addiction overwhelmed his career, hurt his family and probably led to his murder. Yet Crane's seedy private life, which he tried to hide when he was alive, has given him, in death, a strange kind of validation. "Auto Focus," the Bob Crane biopic that will be shown at the New York Film Festival on Friday night and arrives in theaters on Oct. 18, has made him the star he always wanted to be. }

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2  "The attraction of Bob Crane was, Here's a guy that people think they know, but they don't," says Paul Schrader, who directed "Auto Focus," which features a riveting performance by Greg Kinnear as Crane. "This film ripples with ideas: the evolution of American male sexual identity, the corrosive effect of celebrity, even minor celebrity, and the rise of home pornography. Yet Crane is a relatively minor character. He was a so-so sitcom actor. As a person, he wasn't much better. But he was perfect in his lack of awareness. So he can become an emblem without doing great insult to history."}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Schrader, who is sitting on a dark green sofa in his cluttered Times Square office, loves this material. He is grinning like a delighted child, and his oversize glasses seem to magnify his eyes. Growing up in Michigan, Schrader, who is 56, was brought up as a Dutch Calvinist and was forbidden to partake in "worldly amusements" like movies. He planned on becoming a minister. After a mutual friend introduced him to the critic Pauline Kael, however, his life changed. She arranged for him to attend U.C.L.A. film school, and soon afterward, in 1972, Schrader wrote the script for "Taxi Driver."}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Throughout his career, in movies like "Hardcore," "American Gigolo" and "Mishima," Schrader has explored male sexuality, focusing on the tension between propriety and temptation. The allure of sin fascinates him, and the Crane story is an ideal springboard for this theme. To the world, Crane presented himself as an affable actor, a family man with three kids. In private, he was frequenting strip clubs and taping sex with strangers. "Like many of my characters, Bob Crane had a contradictory thought process," Schrader says. "And his contradictions became most vivid when he was with John Carpenter."}

He worked for Sony, instructing wealthy customers on how to operate home-video equipment -- a technology then in its infancy. Carpenter (who is not John Carpenter the horror-film director) set up systems for Elvis Presley and Alfred Hitchcock before selling equipment to Crane. The two men subsequently became friends, united in their pursuit of women in bars, through singles' ads and at swing parties. "A day without sex," Crane liked to say, "is a day wasted."}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Many of these encounters were captured on video. Crane's celebrity helped score the girls; Carpenter typically played cinematographer. The friendship ran aground, however, when Crane's second marriage collapsed and he could no longer find work. (Hollywood had learned of his secret.) Blaming his relationship with Carpenter for his problems, Crane severed contact. This break upset Carpenter, who had become emotionally dependent -- and perhaps sexually fixated -- on his famous friend. That conjecture is central to "Auto Focus"; Schrader frames the symbiotic relationship of Carpenter and Crane as a story of unrequited love. Indeed, when Crane was found dead in Scottsdale, Ariz., Carpenter was the main suspect. He was later acquitted, because of a lack of evidence, and died in 1998.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 "Auto Focus' is a male folie a deux," Schrader says, lighting a cigarette. "Crane and Carpenter get involved in conduct that probably neither would have done alone." And it escalates. In one of the film's most unnerving scenes, Crane and Carpenter masturbate to a video of themselves having sex with women. "It's my Norman Rockwell moment!" Schrader jokes. "You know, Carpenter was not as important in Crane's life as he is in the film. It is a distortion." Schrader, who wrote "Raging Bull" and "The Last Temptation of Christ," has been down that road before. "With 'Raging Bull,' the fights were accurate, but the arguments between the brothers were completely imagined. Of course, Jake LaMotta liked those scenes so much that he started believing they actually happened." Schrader pauses. "My intent with 'Auto Focus' is not to be true or definitive. People's actual lives are not really that interesting. And with Crane I wanted to get at something meaty. Otherwise, who cares? Would you want to watch a movie about Alan Hale?"}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Schrader chortles. His question (which, by the way, refers to the guy who played the Skipper on "Gilligan's Island") is intentionally inflammatory. Schrader knows that Scotty Crane -- the son from Crane's second marriage to his "Hogan's Heroes" co-star, Patricia Olson -- is incensed over the supposed inaccuracies in "Auto Focus." Crane's son from his first marriage, Bobby, is happy with Schrader's treatment. He received $20,000 as a consultant on the film. "Auto Focus" has incited a war among the Cranes, one that has returned the family name to the tabloids. Not incidentally, it has given his sons a taste of what their father craved even more than sex: fame. }

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Usually, family members of stars whose lives become tabloid fodder try to protect that celebrity, asserting that someone's private life is nobody's business. But Scotty isn't embarrassed by his father's sex life. He boasts about it. For him, the crime of "Auto Focus" isn't that it sensationalizes his father's secret life; it's that it portrays Bob Crane as a creep rather than a sexual dynamo. This is odd, to say the least. But one thing is certain: attacking the film is getting Scotty, who is out of work, tons of publicity.}

Schrader leafs through the pictures, which alternate between Crane as a loving father and Crane naked with girls, girls, girls. Clearly, Scotty doesn't see the contradiction in his dad's life that Schrader does. Maybe that's because Scotty's mom doesn't, either. "This is Patti, Scotty's mother," Schrader says, showing a photo of a naked voluptuous blonde. "There's also a picture of Patti with a woman."

"The script is half his life and half his murder investigation," Scotty explains. "It's a lot like 'Pulp Fiction."' By contrast, "Auto Focus" traces Crane's rise from Los Angeles D.J. to "Hogan's Heroes" star and his subsequent decline into the fringes of the entertainment business. Kinnear vividly captures Crane's transformation from ordinary guy into deluded sex addict. The film is sympathetic to Crane's excesses; it's more like a story about an alcoholic than a high-handed attack on a pervert.

"For me, it was like looking at baseball cards. It's not like my father was a drug addict. He didn't drink; he didn't smoke; he just liked sex. If your father's hobby is making airplane models, you don't think it's strange. The reality is, I grew up with pornography. Now, Bob Crane would probably be famous for his home movies.

Everyone, especially Scotty and Patti, claim to be violently upset, but their behavior contrasts tellingly with that of Anne, Crane's first wife. Anne has never uttered a peep about the husband who cheated relentlessly. Everyone else, including Schrader, is feeding off the same corpse. }

"He's just a way to make a point. And his family, such as they are, keep making the point over and over again." Schrader sips his wine. "I used Bob Crane as a metaphor for the corrupting influence of even minor celebrity, and his family have fleshed out my premise." He smiles. "They are the movie. Only, like Bob, they don't know it." }
