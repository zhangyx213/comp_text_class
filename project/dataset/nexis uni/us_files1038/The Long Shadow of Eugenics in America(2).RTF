It's from a 1973 issue of Ebony magazine. The older of the two sisters, Minnie Lee, stares hard at the camera, her gaze direct and unsmiling but pleasant, almost quizzical. Her hair is freshly pressed, hot-curled and brushed into place, making her look older than 14. In a clean white dress with lacy zigzags, she seems ready for Sunday school. Her left arm is draped around her baby sister, Mary Alice, age 12, anchoring her in place. The younger Relf sister cracks a big, playful smile, her hair in braids -- and not the usual three unruly braids from other pictures of the sisters during this time. Instead they are pinned down, neat and tidy for the Ebony shoot. The bottom of Mary Alice's schoolgirl dress is hiked up as she reaches up to rest her right arm, the one that's not fully formed, a disability she was born with, on her sister's shoulder.}

When I knocked on the door of the Relfs' home -- a cramped single-story apartment that looks like all the others in the public-housing complex -- Mary Alice yanked it open with a big smile, the same one in that picture from 49 years ago. She pulled me into the house and said something I didn't quite understand, though after spending time with her, I would come to better comprehend what on that day was a raspy collection of sounds, resulting from a speech impediment and an intellectual disability that make communication difficult for her. }

Weinberger, helped reveal that more than 100,000 mostly Black, Latina and Indigenous women were sterilized under U.S. government programs over decades.

''For those that were directly impacted, for their descendants, and for all of the communities involved, we cannot undo the trauma that this moment has caused, but we can start by formally acknowledging this dark period in our state's history.

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2   By the 1930s, women became a majority of the victims, sterilized in mental hospitals and prisons and under court orders. This shifting gender pattern resulted from a rising concern about the fitness to parent, with a focus on mothering, as well as the development of a safer, standardized tubal-ligation procedure for sterilizing women. The movement was codified in 1927, when the Supreme Court upheld the right of the state of Virginia to sterilize Carrie Buck, a 20-year-old white woman. Born in 1906 to a mother living in poverty in Virginia, Buck was sent to a working-class foster home, where at age 16 she was raped by an extended-family member. Her foster parents took custody of Buck's daughter and successfully petitioned a local court to confine Buck at the Virginia State Colony for Epileptics and Feeble-Minded -- though she was neither epileptic nor intellectually disabled. There she was sterilized without her consent. Writing for the majority in the landmark Supreme Court case Buck v. Bell, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. stated, ''It is better for all the world, if instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime, or to let them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind.'' He added, ''Three generations of imbeciles are enough.''}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2   More than 60,000 men, women and children would be sterilized under these state laws, which would also inform Nazi Germany: The Third Reich sterilized approximately 400,000 children and adults, mostly Jews and other ''undesirables,'' using a 1933 law modeled after legislation in the United States. Germany's Law for the Prevention of Offspring and Hereditary Diseases focused on people with a high probability of having a child with a serious ''defect,'' including blindness, deafness and manic depression. The last eugenics legislation in the United States was passed in Georgia in 1937, and eventually the laws would be rolled back in a series of repeals. But that didn't stop local governments from sterilizing many more people, mostly women of color. The voting rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer was given a hysterectomy without her consent in 1961 when undergoing removal of a uterine tumor by a white physician. The practice of being sterilized, including during unrelated surgery, grew so common among poor Black women in the South that it came to be known as a ''Mississippi appendectomy.''}

Some former field workers went North, but others crowded into Southern cities like Montgomery, the state capital. Census data shows that in 1960, for the first time, Alabama's urban population exceeded the rural population, in a state that was nearly one-third Black.

Though the initial O.E.O. regulations of 1967 stated that ''no project funds shall be expended for any surgical procedures intended to result in sterilization or to cause abortions,'' the prohibition on funding voluntary sterilization ended in 1971. ''The '70s and '80s were this kind of interesting moment where at the same time state sterilization laws were being repealed, America was creating the conditions for the sterilization of the Relf sisters,'' says Dr. Stern of the University of Michigan Sterilization and Social Justice Lab. ''The federal government funneled money into county family-planning programs, especially in the South,'' she continues. ''These facilities were twisted by racial and eugenic logics and pre-existing, longstanding racism and disempowerment of Black mothers and Black girls. Yet there were no checks on anything.''}

Weinberger lawsuit, not long after the family moved into public housing, the Relf sisters were directed to the family-planning clinic of the Montgomery Community Action Committee, which was funded and controlled by the federal O.E.O. The process began with Katie, the oldest of the three girls, who was about 16 when she was first injected with the contraceptive Depo-Provera. At that time, the drug was still in the investigational phase and not yet approved by the F.D.A. for administration to adult women, let alone minor teenagers. Between 1967 and 1978, during a clinical trial of Depo-Provera, the Grady Memorial Hospital Family Planning Clinic in Atlanta administered the drug to 11,400 mostly poor Black women despite serious side effects, including heavy or interrupted menstrual bleeding and near suicidal depression.}

Sometime later, Minnie Lee and Mary Alice were also injected with Depo-Provera. Bly remembers that a member of the staff would later explain the decision by saying that she was worried that ''boys are hanging around the house, and we don't want no more of their kind,'' though there was no evidence that any of the girls were sexually active. The Relf sisters were judged to be intellectually inferior, though only Mary Alice would be diagnosed with an actual disability. The other two girls lacked formal education and were struggling to catch up to their peers. In March 1973, Katie, then 17, was again taken to the family-planning clinic, this time for insertion of an IUD, after the Food and Drug Administration denied approval of Depo-Provera because of its link to cancer in animals. Though Katie was under the age of consent, her parents would later insist that they were not consulted about the IUD.}

Later, when she met them at the hospital, health care providers told Minnie she needed to sign a paper. It is unclear what Minnie Relf understood, but she trusted her daughters in the hands of the staff at this clinic, sponsored by the same government that had given her family a home, food, money and an education for her children. Still, it is very clear from her later Senate testimony that she had no idea that signing the piece of paper would mean that her daughters would never be able to bear children.

In California, more than 17,000 were sterilized between 1920 and 1945 under a state eugenics law used to prevent reproduction of those deemed ''unfit''; a disproportionate number were women of Mexican descent.

The Relfs' suit ended these practices, and H.E.W. was forced to withdraw regulations under which the government funded forced sterilizations.

State documents and interviews pointed to some 100 more procedures dating back to the late 1990s: ''From 1997 to 2010, the state paid doctors $147,460 to perform the procedure, according to a database of contracted medical services for state prisoners,'' C.I.R. reported.}

The A.C.L.U. chapter in Tennessee said in a statement at the time that ''offering a so-called 'choice' between jail time and coerced contraception or sterilization is unconstitutional.'' In the fall of 2020, a nurse at a for-profit Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Georgia reported that unnecessary gynecological procedures -- including hysterectomies -- had been performed on undocumented migrant women. The women said that they had undergone the operations without fully understanding or consenting to them. The Times reported that Dr. Ada Rivera, medical director of the ICE Health Service Corps, said that the whistle-blower's claims ''raise some very serious concerns that deserve to be investigated quickly and thoroughly.''}

But even after the Relf case led to changes in laws, regulations and guidelines regarding forced or coerced sterilization, the question of compensation for the victims has remained. The federal lawsuit was not the only one filed on behalf of the Relfs themselves: Levin and Dees recruited Melvin Belli, nicknamed the King of Torts -- and Melvin Bellicose by insurance companies -- to file a damages suit to compensate the family. Loud and outrageous, Belli was best known for his celebrity clients: Errol Flynn, Mae West, Lana Turner, Lenny Bruce, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Muhammad Ali and the Rolling Stones. In February 1974, Belli's firm filed a $5 million damages suit on behalf of the Relfs against the former White House aides Dean and Ehrlichman and other federal officials for blocking the distribution in 1972 of federal guidelines that would have prevented the Relf sterilizations. After that suit was dismissed, Belli followed with another suit for $15 million that July.}

Three years earlier, the North Carolina Justice for Sterilization Victims Foundation was started to identify survivors of the state's program. The organization estimated that between 1,500 and 2,000 survivors might be alive and recommended paying $50,000 to each. In 2013, the State Legislature set aside $10 million. According to Lombardo, the Georgia State University College of Law professor, nearly 800 North Carolinians filed claims, with 220 qualifying for financial restitution. (To be eligible, the operations had to have occurred under the state's Eugenics Board, but some of the sterilizations occurred outside the auspices of the state, for example at county-run facilities.)}

In 2003, California issued a formal apology to the victims of its eugenics program; last year, the state budgeted $4.5 million as compensation for its survivors. From 1909 through 1979, under state eugenics laws, thousands of people who lived in California state-run hospitals, homes and institutions were sterilized. Even after those laws were repealed in 1979, forced or coerced sterilizations continued to be performed on people in custody at state prisons or other correctional facilities. More than 20,000 people were sterilized in California, more than in any other state, and about 600 survivors are still alive today and eligible for compensation. Each will receive an equal share of the funds in two installments.}

Immediately afterward, Gov. Mike Easley issued a public apology. In April 2003, the North Carolina Senate voted to overturn the sterilization law that had been on the books since 1919. In 2009, the state placed a historical marker in Raleigh to commemorate the 7,600 victims sterilized under the state's eugenics laws between 1929 and 1974, and the media covered survivors' sharing memories of the trauma the surgery caused. In 2010, the North Carolina Justice for Sterilization Victims Foundation was started to find survivors; the following year, Gov. Bev Perdue appointed a task force to study a potential compensation package and its cost. Finally, in 2013, North Carolina's Republican-controlled Legislature voted to spend $10 million to compensate the survivors of the state's eugenics program.}
