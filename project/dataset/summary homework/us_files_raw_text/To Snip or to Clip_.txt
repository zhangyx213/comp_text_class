There's no such thing as a painless vasectomy. But a new device offers faster, simpler sterilization without the usual suturing or cauterizing.

The procedure takes 10 minutes and costs about $350 more than the traditional method (see vasclip.com for doctors). But many experts remain cautious because the clips can be improperly attached.
