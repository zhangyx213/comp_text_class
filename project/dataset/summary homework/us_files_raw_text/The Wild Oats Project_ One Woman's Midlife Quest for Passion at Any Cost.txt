Rinaldi, Robin. The Wild Oats Project: One Woman's Midlife Quest for Passion at Any Cost. Sarah Crichton: Farrar. Mar. 2015. 288p. ISBN 9780374290214. $26; ebk. ISBN 9780374710811. MEMOIR
Magazine editor and writer Rinaldi and her husband, Scott, had reached a marital impasse—she wanted kids, desperately; he did not, definitely. Shortly after Scott got a vasectomy, Rinaldi came up with a plan B (or plan S-E-X) for herself. Instead of divorce, more counseling, or throwing herself into charity work, she chose to pursue erotic experiences. As she put it, she didn't want to look back on her life with "no kids and only four lovers." She devised an open-marriage plan, the Wild Oats Project, whereby she spent weekdays and nights at a bachelorette pad, visiting dating websites, having assignations, joining sex workshops and groups, then heading home to Scott on weekends. As one might expect about her best laid plans, things go awry. But the author gets to put a few notches on her bedpost and perhaps find fulfillment and even more self-knowledge at the end of her project. VERDICT While at times the author is exasperating and one might marvel at her husband's patience, her daring project and avid search for passion is a true page-turner. For anyone who's wondered "what if" or "should I?" [See Rinaldi Q&A, p. 116.]—Liz French, Library Journal
