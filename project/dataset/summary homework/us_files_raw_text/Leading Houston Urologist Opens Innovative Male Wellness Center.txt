Houston, TX,  October 09, 2015 --(PR.com)-- Dr. Russel Williams, a board certified urologist and fertility and microsurgery specialist, has long been providing his Houston-area patients with compassionate and customized care for all manner of fertility, hormonal, sexual performance and general health issues, and he is now extending his reach with the creation of ManCenters, a center dedicated to male health and wellness.
ManCenters is a physician-led clinic under the direction of Dr. Williams. He has assembled a nurse practitioner team that not only specializes in male health issues, but also understands the importance of formulating customized treatment plans for each individual patient.
The male wellness issues ManCenters specializes in include general wellness issues, reproductive and fertility issues, semen analysis, vasectomy - including Dr. Williams' no needle, no scalpel vasectomy, vasectomy reversal, sexual performance issues, low testosterone and hormone imbalance, prostate health, kidney health, and genital pain.
As a urologist with over 15 years of experience, Dr. Williams knows how sensitive many of these medical issues can be. That's why ManCenters is a wellness center created by men, for men. Dr. Williams' vision for ManCenters has always been a fully accessible center where men could feel comfortable seeking guidance for any medical issue at any time. To that end, ManCenters makes it easy to book appointments over the phone or online, and also accepts walk-ins.
The ManCenters office is located in suite 101 at 9190 Katy Freeway, Houston TX, 77055. Dr. Williams and his team can be contacted through the ManCenters website, or by calling (832) 590-0566.
