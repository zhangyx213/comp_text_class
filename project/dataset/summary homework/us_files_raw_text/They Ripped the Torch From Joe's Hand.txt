The opening night of a Presidential convention is reserved for the least important people in government. In a final blow to Joe Biden, the DNC slotted him at 10:50 PM on Monday night. The East Coast will already be sleeping, as will Joe. This disrespect is Kamala saying good night, Joe - I won't be needing you on the campaign trail.
This slighting of Biden puts a spotlight on the hypocrisy like 84-year-old Nancy Pelosi telling 81-year-old Joe Biden that he needs to step aside and then saying to the nation that President Joe Biden deserves a spot on Mount Rushmore. Pelosi said that with as straight a face as she can muster. The Democrats also claim that their message is of hope for the future in the same breath that Planned Parenthood offers free abortions and vasectomies at the Chicago convention. Nothing says joyous future more than killing the unborn and preventing reproduction.
Joe Biden became the first President since LBJ in 1968 not to seek reelection and, appropriately, the first Democrat since Jimmy Carter to be a one-term administrator. Many say these two administrations produced similar results in terms of an economy that was nothing but disastrous for the middle class. Joe Biden can claim till the end of time that Bidenomics is working, but the fact that Kamala Harris is distancing herself from the policy and calling for a new start proves that Democrats don't buy the gaslighting.
Kamala Harris can separate herself from Biden's policies, but she cannot erase three-plus years of support and often as the deciding vote in the Senate to turn the policies into law. The Dems and media are trying to convince Americans that they are better off today than in 2020. Americans trying to balance their checkbooks know that this is not true. People like Juan Williams are adamant that real wages are up which everyone who is working for a check knows this is not true, and inflation has destroyed any gains in wages. They try to cite the low unemployment numbers, but you can also point to the employment numbers to tell the entire story. The stock markets may be up, but nothing else in the economy is favorable.
Biden may be passing the torch to Kamala tonight, but you will not see the Biden family celebrating. The Dems will give Joe a huge ovation, but that will be because of the applause signs flashing in the arena. They will also start having regrets about putting their future in the hands of Harris. The blunders so far are damaging. Picking Walz over Shapiro, making public her socialist economic platform, and denouncing Bidenomics will force the Party to bury her until the election. They are probably plotting to keep her and Walz off the debate stages.
The Dems will get through this choreographed week and will continue to downplay the protesters who forced Chicago businesses to board their windows and shut their storefronts. Kamala will address the crowd on Thursday. She will cackle as the balloons and confetti fall from the rafters, and we will not see her until November. And Joe, he left for vacation after the torch left his hand. We may not see him again.
