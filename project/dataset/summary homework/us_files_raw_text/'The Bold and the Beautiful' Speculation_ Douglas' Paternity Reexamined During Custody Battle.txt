According to  " target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopenerCeleb Dirty Laundry ,  The Bold and the Beautiful , spoilers reveal tension is rising between Hope and Thomas. With neither willing to compromise, a custody battle is on the horizon. The drama will be exciting, especially if Douglas' true paternity is revealed.

Like many of  The Bold and the Beautifulcharacters, Douglas' paternity has always been questioned. Caroline was once involved with Thomas's dad Ridge Forrester (Thorsten Kaye). However, during a brief breakup, Caroline was comforted by Thomas.  Unbeknownst to Thomas, Caroline was inebriated  after taking anxiety medication and liquor. 
After Caroline's controversial night with Thomas, she and Ridge reunited and married. Weeks later, Caroline discovered she was pregnant; however, Ridge dropped a bombshell on his wife. Ridge had a vasectomy years earlier, and doctors told him it couldn't be reversed. 
Ridge and Caroline agreed to keep Douglas' paternity a secret. However, shortly after his birth, they confessed the truth to Thomas. Ridge and Caroline divorced, and she later  reunited with Thomas to raise Douglas together.  
Douglas' paternity has been a long-running debate with fans. Many aren't convinced Thomas is the dad and believe he might have lied about his night with Caroline. Although Ridge was told he couldn't father more children, some viewers believe his doctor lied to him.

 The Bold and the Beautifulhas an opportunity to create juicy drama by rewriting Douglas' paternity. Thomas and Ridge will be shocked and  upset by the paternity bombshell . Thomas will be heartbroken that Douglas isn't his son, and Ridge will face a huge dilemma. Does he tell Douglas the truth or continue to allow Thomas to raise his son?

Ridge being Douglas dad, will also affect Hope's custody intentions. She thought she had a tough fight with Thomas, but Ridge would make it more difficult. Ridge won't let her dictate when and if he sees Douglas and will set new terms for his son's living arrangements. 
Meanwhile, Ridge's relationship with Brooke Logan (Katherine Kelly Lang) will be affected.  Brooke loves being a grandmother to Douglas , but that might change when she learns he's her stepson. Brooke's primary focus has always been on her children and not Ridge's kids. Finding out she has another stepchild might make her insecure and feel like her marriage is being threatened. 
Douglas' paternity is one of those storylines fans would love to see revisited. The custody battle is an excellent way to reintroduce the secret and create drama for everyone involved.
