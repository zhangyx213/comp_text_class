I read the letter, "Time well spent?" in the Jan. 18 TH by Sylvia Addyman of Starlite Drive in Dubuque.
Her quotes regarding "responsible" not "casual" sex and the fact a woman doesn't get pregnant by herself are certainly facts of life.
I also saw what is happening to women today on a recent Oprah TV show. Shown were horribly burned women from some area in India whose parents' dowry didn't satisfy their husband's demands. Also, shown the same day were women who were 12 years old from Ethiopia who were "pledged" to their husbands-to-be and placed in their in-law's home. Due to their young age, when they gave birth, the birth canal was horribly torn and urine leakage after the birth gave them a horrible odor. Thus, they were returned to their parents' home and put in a shed to live out the rest of their lives. A lady doctor who is now nearing 80 has spent years repairing the damage done to these young women.
I've often wondered why folks who want no responsibility for their baby's future and wish to maintain a "casual" rather than a "responsible" sex life don't consult their doctor. Surely, modern medical procedures could reduce problems and save lives as well. Procedures such as vasectomies and tubal ligations do not involve a fetus.
