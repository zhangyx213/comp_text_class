Biel, Joe. The Perfect Mix Tape Segue #3: Fixing the Plumbing . 24p. ¼ legal. $1.  . Distro: AK, M
Offering thoughtful writing on a more obviously male health topic, Biel, the founder of Microcosm Publishing, devotes an issue of his personal zine to his vasectomy. He explains how he chose sterilization after seeing a number of his friends from his Ohio town (many of whom grew up in abusive homes) accidentally conceive children. He decided he never wanted to be in that position and could live without having biological children. He had the surgery when he was 25 and married. Biel also reports on the procedure and his recovery.
