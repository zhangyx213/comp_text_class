Correction


The Healthcare Marketing Impact Awards presentation in the November issue (p. 20) included an incomplete entry for Moderna's #SpikevaxPartner campaign. The campaign was developed by Coegi and Open Influence. Additionally, the entry for the bronze winner for providers and insurers in the digital category should have read Child Care Providers United Health Care Fund Website, developed by the Pinnacle Marketing Team for Child Care Providers United.
