"Under trump the department of health and human services would become the ldquo department of life rdquo once again mdash and worse this article is part of ldquo project 2025 the plot against america rdquo a nation special issue devoted to unpacking the right rsquo s vast and chilling program for a second trump term roger severino a prominent attorney for the christian right led the department of health and human services rsquo office of civil rights during the trump administration in 2017 the atlantic called him ldquo the man behind trump rsquo s religious freedom agenda for health care rdquo the profile contrasted severino rsquo s sparsely decorated office mdash adorned with a crucifix and a clarence thomas bobblehead mdash with his elaborate domestic agenda during severino rsquo s time there trump rsquo s department of health and human services weakened the affordable care act strengthened the ability of healthcare providers to claim religious exemptions from providing all kinds of medical care from abortion to birth control to vasectomies to gender affirming care and created a conscience and religious freedom division in his office under severino rsquo s legal counsel hhs cut teen pregnancy prevention programs and prioritized abstinence in its title x family planning grants backing severino rsquo s crusade was his boss hhs secretary and former eli lilly president alex azar best known for helping trump botch his covid response and presiding over his border policy of separating migrant children from their parents azar came to call his department ldquo the department of life rdquo in his chapter of project 2025 rsquo s mandate for leadership severino promises to make hhs the ldquo department of life rdquo again mdash and to go even farther than azar did the plan outlines how hhs would use its power as a federal agency to dramatically curtail access to reproductive health services severino pledges that hhs will restrict access to birth control rescind the fda rsquo s approval of medication abortion and abolish what he calls ldquo mail order abortion rdquo mdash the latter by using the long dormant comstock act to prosecute anyone who provides such medication by mail hhs will also focus on weeding out programs geared to the rights of lgbt people especially anyone who is transgender it would direct subsidies for childcare facilities to parents themselves mdash all in a punitive misguided effort to shore up the nuclear family this isn rsquo t a public health document it rsquo s a theocratic manifesto an attempt at ensuring public health through ultra orthodox christianity so much for ldquo religious freedom rdquo under ldquo the next administration rdquo read a trump administration severino recommends that nearly every hhs program or agency mdash with special emphasis on the administration for children and families the centers for disease control and prevention the food and drug administration the national institutes of health and the office of the surgeon general mdash be retooled with the goal of promoting heterosexual marriage and procreation he argues that the next president should use his powers to ldquo maintain a biblically based social science ndash reinforced definition of marriage and family rdquo of course he believes that ldquo families comprised of a married mother father and their children are the foundation of a well ordered nation and healthy society rdquo he claims that ldquo all other family forms rdquo apart from ldquo heterosexual intact marriage hellip involve higher levels of instability rdquo severino attacks president biden for ldquo focusing on lsquo lgbtq equity rsquo subsidizing single motherhood disincentivizing work and penalizing marriage rdquo mdash while offering no examples of his policies that did any of the last three things severino calls on hhs to repeal antidiscrimination policy statements that identify sex with ldquo gender identity or sexual orientation rdquo here rsquo s the crescendo ldquo working fathers are essential to the well being and development of their children but the united states is experiencing a crisis of fatherlessness that is ruining our children rsquo s futures rdquo thus hhs policies would ldquo prioritize married father engagement rdquo and stress the importance of heterosexual marriage in all of its health education and welfare programs and it would even enable child abuse prevention funds to be applied to marriage promotion efforts the cdc would be directed to ldquo eliminate programs and projects that do not respect human life and conscience rights and that undermine family formation rdquo the anti abortion crusade too would continue throughout each of the department rsquo s agencies ldquo hhs should return to being known as the department of life by explicitly rejecting the notion that abortion is health care rdquo and the secretary should make sure that ldquo all hhs programs and activities are rooted in a deep respect for innocent human life from day one until natural death rdquo he or she would see to it that no funding whatsoever goes to abortion mdash not via hyde amendment exceptions for rape incest or the life of the mother not even via private insurance subsidized by the affordable care act severino recommends eliminating the hhs reproductive healthcare access task force and creating a ldquo pro life task force to ensure that all of the department rsquo s divisions seek to use their authority to promote the life and health of women and their unborn children rdquo severino would force the fda to ldquo reverse its approval of chemical abortion drugs because the politicized approval process was illegal from the start the fda failed to abide by its legal obligations to protect the health safety and welfare of girls and women rdquo this argument is in front of the supreme court right now and even some of the conservative justices don rsquo t appear to be convinced by it severino promises that no medicaid funding will go to planned parenthood he also proposes reversing a biden administration regulation that groups receiving title x funds must be willing to ldquo refer rdquo women to abortion providers even if they don rsquo t provide abortion themselves thereby allowing ldquo otherwise qualified pro life grantees rdquo to receive funding severino also aims to restrict access to birth control which many of us said would be the right rsquo s next priority after banning abortion wherever possible he announces that hhs must promote ldquo public messaging about the unsurpassed effectiveness of modern fertility awareness ndash based methods fabms of family planning hellip cdc should fund studies exploring the evidence based methods used in cutting edge fertility awareness rdquo severino calls for hhs to prohibit women rsquo s health facilities that receive title x funding from distributing condoms and by declaring that life begins at conception his manifesto appears to commit hhs to finding ways to outlaw ivf which relies on generating multiple embryos most of which are not implanted it could also eliminate birth control methods like the iud and even some forms of the pill severino reserves special vitriol for the cdc which he derides as ldquo perhaps the most incompetent and arrogant agency in the federal government rdquo he wants to strip the cdc of its capacity to issue any kind of public health advice because issuing such guidance is ldquo an inescapably political function hellip for example never again should cdc officials be allowed to say in their official capacity that school children lsquo should be rsquo masked or vaccinated through a schedule or otherwise or prohibited from learning in a school building rdquo his edict declaims instead ldquo a separate agency should be responsible for public health with a severely confined ability to make policy recommendations rdquo severino rsquo s critique of the cdc also shouts christian fundamentalism as he complains about the agency ldquo shutting down churches on the holiest day of the christian calendar and far beyond as happened in 2020 rdquo yes that was easter 2020 ldquo what is the proper balance of lives saved versus souls saved rdquo he asks severino wants to use the cdc rsquo s data collection capacity to police abortion especially those obtained by women forced to travel because of restrictions in their home state ldquo because liberal states have now become sanctuaries for abortion tourism hhs should use every available tool including the cutting of funds to ensure that every state reports exactly how many abortions take place within its borders at what gestational age of the child for what reason the mother rsquo s state of residence and by what method rdquo so the cdc won rsquo t deal with genuine public health crises but it will use its data collection expertise to collect abortion data please remember people may have religious objections but abortion is safer than giving birth severino would also leave americans far more vulnerable to crass capitalism when they are seeking healthcare he wants hhs to promote private sector medicare advantage plans which mdash take it from me i did my homework mdash may give healthy ldquo young rdquo seniors decent benefits at lower costs but which get more expensive and more restrictive as seniors age and need more care he recommends making medicare advantage the ldquo default option rdquo once a person qualifies for the senior citizen health program at age 65 which would be a boon to private insurance companies since it essentially privatizes the wildly popular public program severino would also repeal recent legislation allowing medicare to negotiate better prices for commonly used drugs and he doesn rsquo t like medicaid any better he would weaken the aca provisions that rely on medicaid expansion and would impose work requirements on recipients hhs currently funds certain childcare and preschool programs for low income parents and severino doesn rsquo t like any of them either his plan would do away with the entire head start program for low income preschoolers it rsquo s ldquo fraught with scandal and abuse rdquo he writes and he advises that federal childcare subsidies be directed from care providers to parents themselves enabling them to stay home with their children or pay a family member to do it instead a longtime priority of the christian right finally severino would cancel the ldquo woke policies rdquo of the nih abolishing its diversity equity and inclusion office and halting its efforts to understand gender diversity ldquo instead it should fund studies into the short term and long term negative effects of cross sex interventions rdquo he huffs in fact in every agency and activity under hhs rsquo s auspices severino and his allies would root out any support for lgbt people including research on their health needs so that rsquo s what hhs will do under trump ban abortion police marriage force women to give birth even if they don rsquo t want to force women to marry men and vice versa even if they don rsquo t want to privatize medicare tighten restrictions on medicaid and if you feel like you rsquo d rather not live this way severino wants to criminalize ldquo euthanasia rdquo too
