1978: Steve Dahl comes to Chicago as a host on WDAI 94.7-FM and makes a rowdy first impression with comical, often scatological talk and song parodies. But a format change to disco at the end of the year takes him off the air.
1979: Dahl joins WLUP 97.9-FM and teams up with Garry Meier. Records the Rod Stewart song parody "Do Ya Think I’m Disco?" with his group, Teenage Radiation. Dahl and Meier’s Disco Demolition Night at Comiskey Park between games of a doubleheader results in the field being trashed and the second game being forfeited by the White Sox, but gains Dahl national attention, as does a later John Wayne Gacy song parody, taken off the air when parents of the victims complain.
1981: Dahl and Meier are fired by the Loop and move to WLS-FM. Howard Stern is later said to be a fan of their early material.
1984: Dahl and Meier move to WLS 890-AM.
1986: They return to the Loop.
1989: Dahl undergoes a vasectomy — on the air.
1993: Dahl and Meier split after Dahl insults Meier’s new wife on the air. Dahl moves on to become a host on WMVP 1000-AM.
1996: Dahl moves on to WCKG 105.9-FM, where he’s united as afternoon host with Stern’s syndicated morning show.
2005: Stern leaves CBS Radio for Sirius Satellite Radio.
2007: Another format change prompts Dahl to move to WJMK 104.3-FM as morning host as the only live show on the otherwise automated "we play anything" music station.
2008: Dahl goes off the air with 2 1/2 years left on his contract.
