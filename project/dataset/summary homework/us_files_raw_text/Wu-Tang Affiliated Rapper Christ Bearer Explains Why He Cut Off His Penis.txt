 Wu-Tang Affiliated Rapper Christ Bearer Explains Why He Cut Off His Penis Posted by Larry Csonka[1] on 05.10.2014 And an update on the reattachment surgery…
According to TMZ[2], the Wu-Tang affiliated rapper Christ Bearer has explained why he cut off his penis before jumping out of a window.
Christ Bearer, who is part of the Wu-Tang affiliate Killa Beez, explained that he was depressed because he was alone, and unable to see his two daughter because of restraining orders and a third child on the way. He further explained that he was smoking marijuana, and read a book about monks and vasectomies. He felt that his world was collapsing around him, and since he had thoughts of kids and vasectomies, he proceeded to cut off his penis.
The good news for Christ Bearer is that plastic surgeons were able to reattach his penis and he has regained full functionality; although it is not known if he will be able to have more children.
