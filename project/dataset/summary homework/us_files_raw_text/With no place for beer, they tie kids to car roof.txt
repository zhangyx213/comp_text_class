Ahhhh, summertime is officially here … a slower pace, a time for leisure, more calm, relaxation, really awful boredom …  
OK, scratch all that. 
- In Fort Wayne, Ind., a 29-year-old man was charged with drunken driving after he and his wife had gone shopping at a liquor store, needed the back seat for their purchases and, for the three-block ride home, strapped their four children - ages 4, 5, 6 and 7 - to the hood of the car. 
- At West Hall High and West Hall Middle School in Gainesville, Ga., officials placed both schools on lockdown only two days before summer release when a teacher texted to the office - "gunna be at west hall today" - but her phone auto-corrected the message to "gunman be at west hall today." 
- In Sandwich, Mass., because its recovery period requires men to sit on a couch and rest for a few days, a urologist began offering a free 16-inch pizza to each man who came in seeking a vasectomy during his office’s Vasectomy-And-Pizza Days Special! 
- At Busch Stadium in St. Louis, after losing a bet, a 22-year-old took off his clothes, jumped onto the field and ran naked across the field before being tackled by guards. "He was never a security risk to players," said Cardinals’ third baseman David Freese. "He was naked and didn’t have any place to carry anything. That relaxes that aspect of the drama." 
- In Nederland, Colo., where in 1993 the son of an 89-year-old Norwegian man brought his father’s frozen body in hopes of building a cryonics center, the body remains on dry ice and the facility has not been built. But in honor of such, the town still had its 11th Annual Frozen Dead Guy Days Festival, culminated by The Pink Socks edging The Donner Party to capture its third straight World Coffin Race Championships. 
- At a Radio Shack store in Chicago, a 20-year-old burglar armed with a gun tied up the clerks and made off with $17,000 worth of merchandise but apparently forgot one of the items he stole was a GPS tracking device. That’s when investigators simply activated the device, went to the indicated location and arrested the burglar within two hours of the crime. 
- In Austin, Texas, University of Texas officials apologized for "an egregious typo" in the graduation program that unfortunately listed 3,000 students as graduates of its "Lyndon Baines Johnson School of Pubic Affairs." 
- At a bank in Beavercreek, Ohio, a 39-year-old man approached a teller and asked her to call for paramedics because he thought he was having a heart attack. He then also handed her a note revealing why he was so stressed - he was robbing the  
bank. Paramedics arrived just as police did and, after medics checked over the man to find him fine, police arrested him. 
- In New York City, a man who climbed the side of the New York Times Building and was arrested when he reached–the fifth floor explained later to police he was simply looking for a copy of the newspaper. 
- At the intersection of Pennsylvania 28 and 85 near Kittanning, Pa., traffic was tied up for nearly an hour when a bull and a cow walked onto the road at 9 a.m. and began copulating, spawning a situation that, according to state police, was heightened when officers tried to "move the bull off the cow" but "that only infuriated him" and caused him to "escalate lovemaking procedures." Finally, officers were able to roust the two into a trailer.
