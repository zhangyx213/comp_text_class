The author of several other well-received Facts On File encyclopedias on specialized health topics (most recently, The Encyclopedia of Alzheimer's Disease ), Turkington has produced another winner. With Pound, a urologic oncologist, she has written a clear, comprehensive, and thoroughly researched compendium of the issues related to men's health and male reproductive cancers, including prostate and testicular cancer. The more than 400 alphabetically arranged entries cover such topics as risk factors, treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation, vasectomy and cancer, and more. The volume also includes up-to-date resources and extensive appendixes that list helpful organizations and web sites, cancer centers, drugs used to treat men's cancers, and clinical trials. Bottom LineThis unique reference is a valuable resource on a wide range of subjects concerning men's health and cancer. Highly recommended for consumer health and patient education collections.—James Swanton, Harlem Hosp. Lib., New York
