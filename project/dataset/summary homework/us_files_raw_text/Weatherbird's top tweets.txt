Besides gracing the front page of the newspaper since 1901, I also spend time watching Twitter.
What a week! I know the election stirred a lot of emotions, whether you voted for Donald Trump or not, so I asked Twitter: "Seeking thoughts for my top Twitter column: election tweets? If not, then what topic?"
"A petition to bring back Uncle Tupelo with you and me in the front row at the show???" Andy Kravetz, @andykravetz
"ANYTHING ELSE. But really. (smiley face emoji)" Megan Harris, @MHarrisEditor
@VolunTeenNation, a must-follow account for teens or their parents, posted about a Veterans Day volunteer event.
"Webster Kirkwood rivalry coming to a head on turkey day!" Todd, @BrewMaster314
This one will clearly be easier to do after turkey day!
"How hard 2016 has been in terms of the death of great musicians and great athletes." Geneviève Steidtmann, @gsteidtmann
Sigh. Nope, also too emotional.
Luckily, news broke about a lion that, despite two vasectomies, sired eight cubs. That's some lion!
"This? This I needed today :) LOL" Meg, @megkwall
"Viva la humping!!!!" Kat, @kathro55
"Who gives a lion a vasectomy, much less two?? And why?? #poorfella #whoheldthefrozenveggies" Kathy Garazin, @kgbrowniz
Not sure I can top that last hashtag.
