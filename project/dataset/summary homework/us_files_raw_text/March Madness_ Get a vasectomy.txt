SPRINGFIELD, Ore. (AP) - For guys who park in front of the TV during college basketball's March Madness, the Oregon Urology Institute has a suggestion: Why not use that time to recover from a vasectomy?
"When March Madness approaches you need an excuse ... to stay at home in front of the big screen," the clinic's radio ad says. "Get your vasectomy at Oregon Urology Institute the day before the tournament starts. It's snip city."
Institute Administrator Terry FitzPatrick said men need two to four days to recover from the procedure - but not all take the time.
He's reserved a dozen appointment slots for March 19, the day before the first tipoffs of the NCAA Tournament, and another dozen for March 26, before the tournament's second week.
He reported filling 15 slots by Thursday afternoon and expects to fill all 24.
The sports radio station broadcasting the clinic's ads promises to send each patient a recovery kit of sports magazines, free pizza delivery and a bag of frozen peas.
Peas?
"The frozen peas are malleable enough that you can get them right in there and get the swelling down," FitzPatrick said.
