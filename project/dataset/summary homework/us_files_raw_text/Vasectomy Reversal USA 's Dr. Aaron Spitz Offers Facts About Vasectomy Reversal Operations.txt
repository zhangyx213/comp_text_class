Apr 11, 2016( ReleaseWire: / Delivered by Newstex) Laguna Hills, CA -- (SBWIRE[1]) -- 04/11/2016 -- A common cause of male infertility is a previous vasectomy, but many men change their minds, deciding that they want to increase their family or find themselves desiring to start a new family. Dr. Aaron Spitz and his team, who operate a premier vasectomy reversal practice to patients in the Thousand Oaks, CA[2] area understand the frustrations that come along with failed attempts to start families. Dr. Spitz promises to help couples enhance their abilities to conceive, by providing men with vasectomy reversals.In order to help inform those who do not know much about the vasectomy reversal process, Dr. Spitz, the head of Vasectomy Reversal USA, provided some important information. 
One thing that many couples do not know is that vasectomy reversals are minimally invasive outpatient operations. They take roughly three hours, and the stitches involved are mircosurgical as are the tools used to perform the surgeries. Patients are able to go home the same day as the surgery. Furthermore, conception can occur not long after the surgery takes place. The average pregnancy may occur after several months but some couples conceive within weeks. Every case is individual, so timeframes occur on a patient by patient basis.Dr. Spitz finally debunked the myth that if a man waits longer than 10 years he cannot reverse his vasectomy successfully. Although success rates decline gradually with time since the vasectomy, there is not time that is too long. For those interested in a vasectomy reversal around Pasadena, CA[3] and surrounding areas, they can visit Vasectomy Reversal USA's website, or call 800-352-2956 to schedule a consultation.
