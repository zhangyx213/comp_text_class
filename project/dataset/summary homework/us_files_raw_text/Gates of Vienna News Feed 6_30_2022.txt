With inflation at a 40-year high, another round of stimulus checks might be the last thing economists would recommend right now.

Newsom and legislative leaders are casting the inflationary stimulus checks as 'inflation relief':

Biden responded that Americans, who have been paying nearly $5 a gallon for gas for months, should shell out the extra cash for 'as long as it takes' because Americans paying more helps Ukraine fight Russia.

Breaking: Supreme Court Rules Against EPA's Authority to Limit Emissions by Remaking Energy Sector[78] 
The Supreme Court on Thursday issued a ruling in the case of West Virginia v. Environmental Protection Agency. The 6-3 ruling sides with West Virginia, which sought to limit the Clean Air Act. 
At issue were the EPA's plans to use regulation to 'reduce carbon pollution mostly by moving production to cleaner sources.' Once the EPA determined this course of action, they began to limit allowable emissions from fossil fuel production. They enacted goals that they viewed as a '#8216;reasonable' amount of shift which it based on modeling how much more electricity both natural gas and renewable sources could supply without causing undue cost increases or reducing the overall power supply.'

Suspect Arrested in Deadly Delco Road Rage Shooting, Sources Say[88] 
Law enforcement sources told NBC10 on Thursday night that a suspect has been arrested for a road rage shooting that left a driver dead in Delaware County, Pennsylvania 
A suspect who allegedly shot and killed a driver in Delaware County in a road rage attack was arrested Thursday night, law enforcement sources told NBC10. 
The shooting during rush hour Wednesday morning was reportedly prompted by the suspect's anger at the victim apparently driving too slowly, police said previously. Police have not yet identified the suspect. 
The shooting happened on State Road (Route 1) near Meetinghouse Lane in Springfield, Pennsylvania, around 9 a.m. Wednesday. The Springfield Police Department said on Facebook that the victim was a 54-year-old man who was in his car with his wife. 
Springfield Township Police Department Chief Joe Daly identified the victim as King Hua, a resident of Springfield. Delaware County District Attorney Jack Stollsteimer said Hua and his wife immigrated to the U.S. from Vietnam and were apparently 'living the American dream' before Hua was gunned down. 
Witnesses told investigators that the pair were in the curb lane traveling southbound on State Road when another car being driven by a woman passed them on the shoulder of the road and stopped. That's when a man partially exited the second car and fire shots toward the victim's car, penetrating the windshield, the SPD said. 
Hua, who was in the driver's seat, was struck, and his car hit a van after the shooting, Daly said. The DA's office said the victim was taken to the hospital, where he later died

EU Chief Can't Find Pfizer CEO Texts[102]

France's Energy Sector: 'Soaring Energy Prices Threaten Our Social and Political Cohesion'[105] 
In 2020, Russian gas accounted for 17 percent of gas imports into France, compared with 65 percent in Germany and 43 percent in Italy. In addition, the share of gas in France's electricity production is only 7 percent, thanks to the massive use of nuclear power plants (56 of the 106 nuclear power plants in the EU are in France), which provide about 70 percent of electricity production, compared with 10.5 percent for hydro, 6.5 percent for wind, and 2 percent for solar, according to EDF figures for 2019. 
After a few years of hesitation at the beginning of his first term, following a moratorium on new nuclear power plants, President Emmanuel Macron has decided that it is necessary to invest again in that sector and build new reactors. 
In Germany, gas accounts for more than 15 percent of electricity production, due to Angela Merkel's disastrous 2011 decision to phase out nuclear power and the gradual abandonment of coal, of which Germany remains the largest European user, ahead of Poland.

UK: Killer Son Stabbed Parents 184 Times Then Booked Getaway Flight From Manchester Airport[112] 
A son has been convicted of a brutal double murder of his parents — stabbing them 184 times in a frenzied attack. After killing them at their home in Lancashire, Lee Tipping fled the scene of the crime and later tried to make a getaway from Manchester Airport but lost his nerve.

'We Are Effectively at War With Russia,' Says Polish Energy Security Minister[113] 
The West is 'at war with Russia,' warned Poland's state secretary in charge of energy infrastructure security, Piotr Naimski, while speaking to participants of the EU-US Defense & Future Forum organized by the Atlantic Council. He explained that politicians are often in denial about this, wanting a return to the period preceding the war, but they should be getting ready for Russian attempts at sabotage of energy infrastructure. 
He painted a picture of an extraordinary situation. 'We are discussing taking decisions with regard to sanctions, limiting imports and exports, price caps for certain products, and even rationing energy. These are decisions that do not normally have to be taken in a market economy, but we are being forced to explore them because we are in an abnormal situation caused by war.'

Russia-Ukraine War: What Happened Today (June 30)[115] 
As Thursday draws to a close in Kyiv and in Moscow, here are the key developments of the day: 
Ukraine won back control over Snake Island, which Russia occupied in February. Ukrainian officials said Russian troops evacuated after Ukraine's overnight bombardment. Russia said it left the island as a 'goodwill gesture' for Ukraine's grain exports. The strategic outpost in the Black Sea is where Ukrainian soldiers famously refused to surrender to the Russian warship Moskva. 
President Biden said the U.S. would provide $800 million more in security assistance for Ukraine. Speaking at the close of a NATO summit, Biden said the war 'will not end with Russia defeating Ukraine' and that allies would support Ukraine 'as long as it takes.' Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier said his country had no 'problem' with Finland and Sweden joining NATO but would have to respond if the alliance built up a military presence along its northern borders. 
Amnesty International said the Mariupol theater bombing was a clear war crime. A new report by the human rights organization concluded that the attack 'was almost certainly carried out by Russian fighter aircraft.' Hundreds of civilians sheltered in the building during the March siege of the southern port city that Russian troops now occupy. 
The European Court of Human Rights told Russia to ensure two British captives don't get the death penalty. In early June, a court in a Russian-backed separatist part of Ukraine sentenced Shaun Pinner and Aiden Aslin to death. Russia's government, which pulled out of the European rights jurisdiction after invading Ukraine, said it no longer complies with the European court's orders. 
Ukraine said it broke ties with Syria for recognizing the independence of eastern Ukraine's Luhansk and Donetsk regions at Russia's request. Ukraine's foreign ministry said in recent years it had already ordered the closure of its and Syria's embassies over crimes of the Syrian regime, which is friendly with the Kremlin. Kyiv said it will now also impose a trade embargo and other sanctions against Syria.

Leaked Documents Reveal Wide Scope of China's Human Rights Violations in Xinjiang[117] 
Documents and photos of thousands of ethnic Uighurs arrested by Chinese authorities, made public in late May, lend additional indisputable evidence to the Communist regime's massive human rights violations in Xinjiang. Many of the leaked documents are official Chinese Ministry of Interior dossiers of incarcerated individuals just from Shufu, one among 61 counties in Xinjiang Province. The Shufu County in the Kashgar Prefecture is the site of several large internment camps. 
One of the leaked documents, which contains 'a shoot to kill order' for guards in the camp's watchtowers, confirms that these camps are indeed prisons. Another leaked report stipulates how detainees are to be transported from one site to an alternate location: ankle shackles, handcuffs and hoods.

Globally the G7 Are a Minority[137] 
It is repeatedly claimed that the G7 are the 'most important industrialized countries' and thus generally the most important countries in the world. However, on closer inspection this contention is wrong. 
Two misconceptions are very popular in the Western mainstream when it comes to the current G7 summit. On the one hand, it is repeatedly claimed that the G7 are the 'most important industrialized countries' and thus generally the most important countries in the world. However, that is wishful thinking at best. To ascribe greater economic importance to countries like Italy or Canada than China or India is untenable. 
On the other hand, regarding the topic of the Ukraine war and the sanctions policy, the entire world is not on the side of Ukraine as is often claimed. Not a single South American or African country and, with the exception of Japan and South Korea, not a single Asian country has signed up for sanctions. States in which the US actually has a great deal of influence, such as Israel, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Colombia and Pakistan, are also not on board.
