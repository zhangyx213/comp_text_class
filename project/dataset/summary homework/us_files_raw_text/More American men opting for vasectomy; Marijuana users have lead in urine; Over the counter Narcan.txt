More American men opting for vasectomy
Vasectomy rates in the United States rose by 26% between 2014 and 2021, according to a new survey. The highest increases were in men without children (61%), men with an older wife (41%), and single men (41%). Doctors expect these rates to increase following the abolishment of Roe v. Wade. 
Marijuana users have lead in urine 
Marijuana users were found to have 27% higher lead levels in their blood and urine in a new survey. The users also had 22% higher levels of cadmium in their blood. Researchers say that marijuana plants absorb heavy metals from the soil which are then transferred through the leaves and flowers.
