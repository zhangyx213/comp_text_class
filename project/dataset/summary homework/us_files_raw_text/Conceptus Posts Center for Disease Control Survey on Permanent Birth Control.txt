According to the recently released 2006-08 National Survey of Family Growth by the Center for Disease Control, one in four women choose permanent birth control, said Conceptus in a release.
Female permanent birth control is used by 16.7 percent, or 10.3 million women, and male sterilization (vasectomy) is used by the partners of 6.1 percent, or 3.7 million women.
Conceptus said its Essure permanent birth control procedure is a safe and effective solution.
"From the CDC data, we can infer that when combined, permanent birth control for both men and women is the single most prevalent form of birth control used today," said Mark Sieczkarek, CEO of Conceptus.
The company said the Essure procedure is 99.80 percent effective with zero pregnancies reported in four years of clinical trials.
The Essure procedure is a hormone-free permanent birth control procedure that can be performed without surgery, burning, anesthesia or the risks associated with tubal ligation. Small, flexible inserts are placed in a woman's fallopian tubes through the cervix without incisions. Over the next three months, the body forms a natural barrier around the micro-inserts to prevent sperm from reaching the egg. The procedure is covered by most insurance plans, and when it is performed in a doctor's office the cost may be as low as a simple co-pay.
Three months after the Essure procedure, a doctor performs an Essure Confirmation Test to confirm both that the inserts are in place and the fallopian tubes are fully blocked, and that the patient can rely on Essure for permanent birth control.
Conceptus is a provider of design, development and marketing of solutions in women's healthcare.
