Funnyman Seth Rogen does not think that there is anything funny about the recent Hobby Lobby ruling, and took to Twitter to voice his opinions.
The comedian tweeted Tuesday, one day after the Supreme Court ruled in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby that closely held for-profit companies can be exempt from covering birth control under the Affordable Care Act for employees and their families based on religious beliefs.
"The people at Hobby Lobby are a--holes and those who voted to let them be a--holes are also a--holes," Rogen tweeted, with an article from The Huffington Post that explained that the company will still cover vasectomies and Viagra.
