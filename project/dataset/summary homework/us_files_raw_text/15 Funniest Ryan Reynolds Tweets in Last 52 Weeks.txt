Mar 06, 2017( The Wrap: / Delivered by Newstex)  You want a good laugh? Try following Ryan Reynolds[1] of Twitter. TheWrap has kept tabs on him over the last 12 months to see just how funny this Sexiest Man Alive is. 
Our ruling — he is off the charts. Check it out. 'Airplane toilets are aggressive. It wasn't until I got back to my seat that I noticed my pants and testicles were missing.' 'Went to Disneyland because my daughter's obsessed with Mickey Mouse. She was so excited when I got home and told her.' 'People in LA are deathly afraid of gluten. I swear to god, you could rob a liquor store in this city with a bagel.' 'Amazing day Weird how they write the name in ALL CAPS. Like I'm yelling at all the nice people walking by. For eternity.' In response to Hugh Jackman[2] saying Reynolds was 'lurking in my shadow': 'I'm not lurking in your shadow. I'm caressing its soft, shadowy fur.' Referencing 'The Notebook' parody that had Reynolds locking lips with Conan O'Brien: 'We're not kissing. We're feeding each other like baby birds.' 'I sometimes confuse watching political coverage with swan-diving into a swimming pool filled with liquid rabies.' 'So what if I like drawing little hearts around @RealHughJackman's name. I can't be gangsta every second of the day.' 'I'm gonna bang the whole country by turning the White House into a giant condom made of wood and concrete. - rejected campaign slogan.' 'Someone should bottle the unspeakable emotional terrorism between Brides and Maids of Honor. Then pour it on our enemies.' 'It's difficult but not impossible to make love while singing MMMbop. I'm sorry for this tweet.' 'At some point, you'll rest in an unvisited grave of twigs and spit.— rejected fortune cookie.' 'Put the baby down in her crib tonight. She scrunched her nose so cute, giggled, then turned into thousands of bats.' 'No matter which kids book I read to my screaming baby on an airplane, the moral of the story is always something about a vasectomy.' 'After this morning's diaper, my daughter finally earned the teardrop tattoo on her face.'Related stories from TheWrap: Ryan Reynolds Introduces 'Logan' With 'Deadpool 2' Teaser[3]Watch Aliens Shut Ryan Reynolds' Mouth in 'Life' Trailer (Video)[4]Ryan Reynolds Offers Oscar Congrats Despite 'Deadpool' Snub[5]Ryan Reynolds Pitches 'Deadpool' to Oscar Voters (Video)[6]Golden Globes: Ryan Reynolds Shared a Kiss With Andrew Garfield[7]Ryan Reynolds Roasted by Hugh Jackman as 'Deadpool' Actor Receives Walk of Fame Star[8] [ 1]:  [ 2]:             [ 3]:            / [ 4]:            / [ 5]:            / [ 6]:            / [ 7]:            / [ 8]:            /
