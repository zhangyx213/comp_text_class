NEW DELHI: Get yourself tested for AIDS, it's in fashion, says a recent AIDS campaign endorsed by Miss Universe 2005 Natalie Glebova in the city. And the youth seem to be listening.
As volunteers at the AIDS counter in National Rural Health Mission pavilion would tell you, at least 50 visitors, in the age group of 15-30, come to them daily for information on sex-related topics.
"We were not expecting a good response but the reception has been surprising. Most teenagers who visit us have already had sex and want to know the dangers involved," says Lata, a counsellor at the stall.
"The visitors are mostly male as they are not shy to ask questions. About 65% of their queries are sex related," she adds.
The counter is conducting on-the-spot HIV tests, where at least 10 to 12 people have their blood tested every day. A free no-scalpel vasectomy operation is being offered as well and 28 people in the past four days have opted for sterilisation.
Volunteers claim more than half their stock of condoms, which they are distributing, has been exhausted. Hindustan Latex Limited has displayed its condom vending machine that it has just introduced in Chandigarh. The distributors are hoping to launch the product in Delhi.
Says an 18-year-old:"I just got into a relationship and had a lot of questions in my mind about sex. The counsellors here have cleared lot of my doubts."
The Mission is also offering eye check-ups, blood tests and emergency contraceptive pills. "We cater to 200-300 people everyday, the number doubles in the weekend," says a volunteer.
