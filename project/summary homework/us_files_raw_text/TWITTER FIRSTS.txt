Mike Massimino ("Astro_Mike") became the first astronaut to Twitter from space. Here are a few St. Louis firsts we'd like to see.
First doctor • Local surgeon Twitters while performing vasectomy. Tweet cut short.
First Cardinal • Chris Duncan Twitters while dropping fly ball. Redbird replaced by Twitterbird.
First wrongly accused • Man jailed for secretly following Chief Daniel Isom on Twitter. Cops plead ignorance.
First colonel • Officer's retweet command misunderstood at Fort Leonard Wood. Soldiers run to rear.
First Ram • Alex Barron nudges and blocks fans during game. Marc Bulger injured when pocket collapses.
