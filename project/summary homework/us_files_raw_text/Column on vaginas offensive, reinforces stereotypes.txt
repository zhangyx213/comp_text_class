I am terribly offended by Bryan Wilson's column, "Enhanced vaginas a revolutionary idea."
An article fueled by the upcoming election, Wilson obviously has no interest in women's reproductive rights. His opinion on women's bodies is arrogant and incredibly sexist.
In his article, Wilson speaks only to men, basically saying that men are in no way responsible for unexpected pregnancies resulting from "unprotected sex with some girl" while the man is drunk.
Here's an idea: if you don't want to get "some girl" pregnant, why don't you stop with the ridiculous claim that men who have promiscuous sex are more accepted by society than women.
It is shameful that men are allowed to run around having sex with anything that moves while women are supposed to be pure and innocent and refrain from promiscuity.
If men like Wilson are so concerned about getting girls pregnant, they should do the human race a favor and get a vasectomy.
It is impossible for a woman's body to shut down a pregnancy at will, but one quick little doctor's appointment will fix everything for these misogynistic men.
