HELENA, Mont. - The Montana House endorsed a bill Friday that would require health insurance companies to offer coverage plans that do not include elective abortions.
Representatives voted 55-44 to endorse Senate Bill 349. It was carried by Republican Rep. Vince Ricci of Laurel for sponsor Sen. Cary Smith, R-Billings.
The measure would require insurers offering plans that cover elective abortions to also offer at least one plan that doesn't do so. The bill doesn't include abortion coverage for cases such as incest, rape or when the life of the mother is at risk.
"Many people in Montana do not want to participate in group policies that offer elective abortion," Ricci said.
Democratic Rep. Ellie Hill of Missoula spoke against the measure, saying no insurance companies support the bill and no other conditions such as vasectomies are put on insurance policies in this manner.
"The abortion bills continue to get more creative," she said. "If you believe in less government and if you believe in individual privacy, you should vote no on this bill."
At least 21 states have passed legislation to restrict abortion coverage in their insurance exchanges since the Affordable Care Act was enacted in 2010, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The law allows states to pass legislation prohibiting abortion coverage in qualified health plans offered through an exchange.
If the bill passes third reading in the House, it will go to the governor for consideration.
