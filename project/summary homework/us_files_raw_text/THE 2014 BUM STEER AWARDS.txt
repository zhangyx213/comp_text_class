HOUSTON -- According to the astonishing new results of an exhaustive twelve-month study published for the first time in Bum Steer News and jointly conducted by NASA, the Centers for Disease Control, the West Abilene Psychic Certification Center, and the Corpus Christi Metal Detecting Club, last year was the fourth-bum-steeriest year in Texas history. The only steerier years have been 1982 (#3), 1845 (#2), and 1957 (#1 on the basis of the Amarillo Zombie Outbreak and subsequent alien invasion that installed Price Daniel as governor). Causes of the 2013 steer surge are still unknown but may include contamination of the drinking water in certain parts of the state by a mutant steer virus, as well as the curse of an ancient bum steer mummy. ¶ NASA steertistician Dr. Elwin Harlock, lead researcher on the project, noted a preponderance of bad behavior in the Dallas area, explaining, "Historically, we have found that an individual known as Jerry Jones is likely to boost the results for the Metroplex. But 2013 was a relatively quiet year for him, and Dallas still exceeded our expectations." ¶ However, the epicenter of the steerpocalypse, as many are calling it, appears to have been Houston. In 2013 the metro area produced an unfathomably horrible baseball team, a phenomenally bad football team, a lieutenant governor prone to embarrassing moments on the telephone, and a U.S. senator prone to shutting down the federal government while reading nursery rhymes from the dais. Then, to top it all off, the city's voters declined to save the Eighth Wonder of the World. 
In fact, the three largest sources of steerishness identified by Dr. Harlock are all located in the Bayou City. That would be the Houston Astros, the Houston Texans, and Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst. Research shows a steertistical dead heat among these contenders, making them our joint Bum Steers of the Year!
AT LEAST THE SNAKE DIED LAUGHING!
TEXARKANA-A woman and her son were doing yard work when they encountered a snake. They decided to kill the snake by dousing it with gasoline and setting it on fire, but the burning serpent slithered into a nearby brush pile, igniting it, and the fire then spread to the woman's home, which was completely destroyed.
"NO, TIMMY, YOU'RE NOT ON THE HORNY HOUSEWIVES 6 BUS, YOU'RE ON THE NAUGHTY NURSES 3 BUS"
Parents of elementary school students in the Birdville ISD sued charter bus company Executive Coach Inc., alleging that as their children were boarding a charter for a class field trip, a pornographic film was playing on the bus's TV monitors.
THE TIMES REGRETS THE ERA
During the special session for SB 5, a New York Times correction said, "The proposed legislation that State Senator Wendy Davis helped to block in the Texas Legislature would restrict abortion after 20 weeks, not 20 years."

THANKS TO THIS JURY, HE DID EVENTUALLY GET OFF
A Bexar County jury acquitted Ezekiel Gilbert of murder in a shooting that eventually caused the death of Lenora Ivie Frago. The jury accepted Gilbert's argument that because Frago--a Craigslist-advertised "escort"--took Gilbert's $150 payment but didn't have sex with him, he was justified by Texas law "to use deadly force to recover property during a nighttime theft."
"OSHIFFER, I DRANK THE FIFTH ... HIC! ... I MEAN, I TAKE THE FIFTH"

LIKE A ROCK

"Sir, I Said Slide Out of the Car, Now!"
Following a lengthy car chase in Williamson County, Scott MacFarland refused officers' commands to exit his vehicle, forcing them to physically remove him, a difficult task since he was naked and covered in a "greasy substance."
"YOU SAY IT'S A LARGE YELLOW THING WITH HUGE TIRES AND A BIG METAL SCOOP IN FRONT? GEE, I'M NOT SEEING IT ON MY DESK"
COUPLAND -- Workers sent by Safeguard Properties to clean out a house in foreclosure went to an unrelated property nearby instead, where they forced open and emptied a barn used for storage. Efforts by the property owner to recover his belongings, which included irreplaceable family keepsakes and a backhoe, were unsuccessful.
"Fine--Round It Down to Infinity Billion Dollars An Hour And We'll Put It Behind Us"

SIEVE FREE OR DIE!
Texas Tech student Eddie Castillo spent months trying to get permission from the DPS to wear a colander on his head while posing for his state ID photo, arguing that doing so was a protected expression of his belief in Pastafarianism, a satirical faith whose adherents disdain organized religion and revere a deity known as the Flying Spaghetti Monster. The ID card he ultimately received did not feature his sacred headgear.
Dude, No One Got in to See Kanye At South-By. Get Over It.

SHOCKING DEWHURST PHONE CALL!
Still smarting from the whupping Ted Cruz gave him in the 2012 Republican primary for the U.S. Senate, David Dewhurst kicked off 2013 with the unpleasant news that his longtime adviser Buddy Barfield had allegedly embezzled as much as $2.3 million from his campaign coffers. He made it through the Eighty-third Legislature without incurring much ridicule, but at the end of the first special session, his poor clock management let Wendy Davis filibuster herself onto the national stage, a blunder that earned him harsh Republican criticism. So one can understand why, as the summer drew to a close, the lieutenant governor felt the need to flex his muscles. How else to explain the ill-advised call he placed on August 3 to the Allen Police Department, in a fruitless attempt to spring a relative who'd been jailed on a shoplifting charge? A recording of the call was released several weeks later, giving Texans a cringe-worthy glimpse of their lite guv trying in vain to throw his diminishing weight around.
Many commentators expressed surprise that a veteran politician would make such a boneheaded mistake, but not us. Earlier in the year, Bum Steer News obtained a recording of another instance of the Dew trying awkwardly to use his clout. Out of respect, we sat on the story. But now the truth can be revealed.
DOMINO'S PIZZA: Hello, Domino's Capitol area. May I take your order?
DAVID DEWHURST: This is David Dewhurst, the lieutenant governor of the state of Texas, but you may simply call me Lieutenant Governor Dewhurst.
DOMINO'S: Mmmkay. Will this be for pickup or delivery?
DEWHURST: No, I want to speak with the top man in charge there.
DOMINO'S: You got 'im.
DEWHURST: Your name?
DOMINO'S: Reggie. I'm the shift manager.
DEWHURST: Thank you, Mr. Reggie. Yesterday I spoke with a young lady named Cassandra.
DOMINO'S: Was there a problem?
DEWHURST: Reggie, you don't know me, but I am the number one pick every year of the Franchise Restaurant Operators of Texas. So I'm a big supporter of what you all do down there.
DOMINO'S: Great. So you won't mind if I put you on hold, then?
DEWHURST: No, do not put me on--
[Two minutes of hold music]
DOMINO'S: Domino's Capitol area, this is Reggie. How can I help you?
DEWHURST: Reggie, this is Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst. I need you to terminate your employee Cassandra.
DOMINO'S: You want me to murder my own employee?
DEWHURST: I did not say "murder." You are taking my words and twisting them. Is this call being recorded?
DOMINO'S: No! Well, I mean, yes, for customer service purposes.
DEWHURST: That's fine! Because I'm not asking you to give me, the lieutenant governor of the state of Texas, special treatment.
DOMINO'S: But why Cassie? She's one of my best workers.
DEWHURST: Mr. Reggie, are you familiar with the Dominator?
DOMINO'S: The Dominator? You mean that specialty pie we had back in the nineties?
DEWHURST: That is correct. Yesterday I tried to order one from Cassandra. Do you know what happened?
DOMINO'S: She said she couldn't do it?
DEWHURST: I'm going to ask you a question, Reggie. Do you all make your pizzas with dough, sauce, and cheese?
DOMINO'S: Yessir.
DEWHURST: And the Dominator, it was made from the same ingredients?
DOMINO'S: Well, yeah, but--
DEWHURST: I want a Dominator, and you are going to make me one.
DOMINO'S: But it's not on our menu. I don't even have a button for it.
DEWHURST: Unbelievable. Reggie, are you familiar with the Republican principles of self-reliance?
DOMINO'S: Is that a band?
DEWHURST: You have all the basic ingredients of a Dominator. I am simply asking you to put them together--not as one of the most powerful men in Texas but rather as an ordinary citizen who simply wants a thirty-inch-long pizza pie.
DOMINO'S: Well, I guess I could take the dough from five Crunchy Thin Crusts and mash them together, and then if we lay it on one of the bread pans ...
DEWHURST: You see? Now you are using the kind of up-by-the-boot-straps initiative that I prize as a very conservative tea party Republican. Or pretend to.
DOMINO'S: Where would you like it delivered?
DEWHURST: My ranch. Write this down: it's the Snaffle Bit Ranch.
DOMINO'S: We don't serve Snapple, sir. How about a Nestea?
DEWHURST: No, it's the name of my ranch. The Snaffle Bit Ranch.
DOMINO'S: Uh, I'm kinda thinking that's gonna be outside our delivery area.
DEWHURST: Reggie, I'm going to have Colonel Steve McCraw, who is the director of the DPS, call you personally in about ten minutes to discuss the transport of my pizza pie. He has the power to arrest every one of your drivers, impound their cars, suspend their licenses, and even take away their thermal pizza sleeves. But hopefully this will be a friendly call. Will you let Director McCraw help you find your way to the Snaffle Bit Ranch with my Dominator?
DOMINO'S: Um, yes.
DEWHURST: Good. My Dominator is important, Reggie. And you aren't just doing this because you're afraid of what I might do if you don't, right?
DOMINO'S: No! Well, I mean, yes.
HOUSTON AFFLICTED WITH MUTANT BUM STEER VIRUS!!!!
By Dr. Ronald Berger, Bum Steer News Special Correspondent
Houston is a great city, known as a hub of innovation, diversity, and first-class arts and culture. But last year it was plagued with Bum Steers. Experts now believe that a mutant virus may have contaminated the water supply. Or at least the brains of these dopes!
