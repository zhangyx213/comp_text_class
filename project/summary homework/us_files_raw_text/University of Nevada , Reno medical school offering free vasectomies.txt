RENO, NEV. —
A medical school at a Nevada university is offering free vasectomies, the Reno Gazette Journal reported.
 The University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine will be offering the no-cost procedure. Previously, the school has offered free vaccinations, flu shots and cold treatments, but the school decided to branch out, according to the newspaper.
 Patients will be required to schedule a consultation, complete paperwork and take a physical a month before the minor surgery, KTVN reported.
 The surgery, which takes between 15 to 45 minutes to complete, usually costs between $500 and $3,000, the Gazette Journal reported. The surgery will be performed by a doctor, and medical students will observe and assist in the procedure, the newspaper reported.
 "It's a great educational opportunity," Tessa Bowen, communications manager for UNR's Medical School, told the Gazette Journal.
 Vasectomies offer a highly effective contraceptive option and allow men the opportunity to take on a greater role in their contraceptive responsibility." Nevada Reno professor Daniel Spogen, chairman of the school's family and community medicine department, told KTVN in a statement.
