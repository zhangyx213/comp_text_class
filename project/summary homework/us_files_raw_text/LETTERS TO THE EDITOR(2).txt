<b>LEVY IS WORTH IT</b>
  While the economy of our country and state run through cycles of ups and downs, politicians win and lose elections, and leadership for organizations and businesses change, one constant remains: every fall students and dedicated educators return to the classroom, support sites and behind the scenes to prepare our youth for the future.
  And while it's a difficult economic time right now, the Spokane Public Schools replacement levy election is essential to protect and sustain our children's education. This replacement levy asks voters to continue a three-year levy approved in 2009. The measure is not asking for money to fill pockets or propose anything new; major program and personnel cuts have been made during this time of economic downturn.
 This levy would protect existing resources and provide for many essential aspects of our students' education. Without the support of this levy, our students will be directly and negatively impacted. Students deserve the opportunity to have a well-rounded educational experience that takes into consideration the unique and wonderful strengths of each individual.
  Without levy funding, their education will be severely impacted. Every student is not the same, and all 29,275 in Spokane schools deserve the best we can offer.

 <b>PUSH FOR GUN CONTROL</b>
  The Jan. 16 letter from J. M. Lyons ("Rainier shooting unrelated to law") used the extremely tragic murder of the Mt. Rainier National Park ranger for the purpose of, once again, justifying the National Rifle Association, and the right to bear arms. Hopefully, her grieving family will not see this letter.
 The very overused cliche, "Guns don't kill people, people kill people" is not always accurate, especially when there are AK-47s (only purpose: to kill people) right here in Spokane, in closets, under beds, in auto trunks, etc.
  Why doesn't the National Rifle Association power a long and hard campaign to keep weapons out of the hands of the wrong people? And eliminate their availability? This would truly justify its existence!

 <b>HAVING A CHOICE IS CRITICAL</b>
  In response to the Jan. 20 piece, "Bill links maternity, abortion coverage": As a female, feminist and American, I strongly support HB 2330, which requires any health care plan that covers maternity care also cover abortion procedures. It is essential that women have this choice offered to them as an option within their health care coverage.
  It is an incredibly difficult decision for women, who must decide whether or not to have a child. Not being able to afford an abortion, or having a baby because insurance will cover it, should not be factors in that decision.
  What would really level the playing field is if every insurance company offering both maternity care and abortion procedures would also offer vasectomies. In my humble opinion, for those who do not support abortion, the choice should be simple: don't have one.

 <b>CHOICE IS THE DIFFERENCE</b>
  To even suggest that same-sex couples have more rights than heterosexual couples is absolutely ridiculous. However, it seems to be what Kat Fiessinger ("Same-sex couples favored," Jan. 20) believes. Kat, it would seem to you that same-sex couples are more privileged because they are able to add each other to their health insurance plans and get other benefits of marriage without having to get married.
  However, what you don't seem to get is that same-sex couples aren't withholding from marriage because of a personal choice, like you and your partner, they are withholding because the law requires them to. There is no reason for there to be domestic partnerships for heterosexual couples. They have the ability to get married and enjoy all of the rights, and more, of this domestic partnership that is so desirable to you.
