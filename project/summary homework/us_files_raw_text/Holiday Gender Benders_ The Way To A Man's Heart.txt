Father's Day isn't exactly a time in which we Americans embrace out-of-the-box thinking. A few years ago, when a minor league baseball team in South Carolina tried to shake things up with a proposed "Vasectomy Night" in honor of dear not-so-old dad, the public outrage was immediate and the event was, yes, nipped in the bud.
Our collective creativity is even worse when it comes to gift-giving. If one accepts the old axiom that "It's easier to buy for a woman," no comfort will be found from a keyword search of "Father's Day" on FindGift.com, which reveals such dubious items as an embossed golf ball, a paperweight engraved with The Five Simple Rules to happiness, a personalized "I'm the boss" cartoon/print and a business card sculpture in the form of a golfer underneath a glass dome (sans "snow").

Consumers looking to break out of the mold, literally, might turn to Chocolate Bar, a specialty store in Greenwich Village, New York. Prepping for the June 19 holiday, the retailer is offering its Dapper Dad collection, an assortment of bon bons served in its signature brown box wrapped in an orange tie. Honorary flavors include Chocolate Boy Muskadine (southern grape infused in dark chocolate) and Love Potion #9 (a dark manjari truffle decorated with Xs and Os). The store is also featuring gifts such as Papa Rocks, a Chocolate Bar rock 'n' roll
T-shirt and two chocolate bars; and the Big Daddy Set, with a 12-piece truffle assortment and a set of eight Retro chocolate bars.
There's a lot of love to be bought here. Consumers spend an average of $80 on Father's Day gifts, according to a 2004 survey by Unity Marketing. That would get dad a 48-piece box of Chocolate Bar truffles and still leave enough for a Sea Monkey office pet on DiscoverThis.com.
