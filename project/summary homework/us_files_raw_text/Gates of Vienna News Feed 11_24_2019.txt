Officials say the 42 people were charged with disorderly conduct for the protest, according to The Associated Press.[59]  As School District Implements Busing Over Near-Unanimous Opposition, Chinese Immigrants See Communism[60] The Howard County, Maryland, school board voted to implement a massive, 1970s-style busing program Thursday, despite overwhelming opposition. After one vote failed, members went into a back room, and when they came out, one of the members who voted 'no' was crying. They did a do-over and she changed her vote. Board member Jennifer Mallo lectured to constituents who voiced displeasure, saying it was a 'privilege' that they got to witness the meeting, admonishing them not criticize her on social media, and complaining about her salary. Immigrants from China and the former Soviet Union said that what they were witnessing reminded them of the totalitarian regimes where they grew up.[61]  Bannon: 'Shift' In Disapproval Over Democrats' Impeachment Circus 'Pretty Amazing'[62] Support for impeachment collapses among key independent voters.[63]  Black Support for President Donald Trump Hits 34% in Both Emerson and Rasmussen Polls![64] Don't expect to see this reported in the liberal mainstream media! The Total black approval for President Donald Trump hit 33-4% in BOTH the Emerson and Rasumussen polls this weekend! Our Twitter Follower Roee spotted this from the Emerson College poll just out.[65]  Christian Leader Franklin Graham Says There is 'Demonic Origin' To Resistance to President Trump[66] Christian leader Fraklin Graham joined talk show host Eric Metaxas on Thursday to discuss the most recent coup attempt by the Democrats to remove President Trump from office. During their discussion Franklin Graham pointed to the obvious, that there is a 'demonic origin' to the Democrat resistance to President Donald Trump. It's been obvious for a long time, Pastor Graham. Have you seen Schiff lately?[67]  Climate Freaks Arrested in Pelosi's Office[68] Nine activists with Extinction Rebellion Washington DC were immediately arrested this afternoon after barging into a back section of Nancy Pelosi's office to demand a meeting to discuss climate change. 'We entered into the back part of her office which was off limits,' said Russell Gray, an Extinction Rebellion DC organizer. 'We were there for about 30 seconds and we didn't see her, and we tried to walk out.' [Comment: Apparently this occurred a few day ago.][69]  Cops Held Mentally Ill Man Down on Scorching Asphalt Until His Skin Literally Melted Off[70] A California man is suing the city of Citrus Heights and several of its police officers for the horrific injuries — skin literally melting off — when police forced him onto the ground of a restaurant parking lot when the temperature was more than 100 degrees outside. The city finally settled this lawsuit, but it was just learned that police and officials forced the victim's attorney and the victim to stay silent about it. Luckily, the press is not subject to the same terms.[71]  'Delete WhatsApp Unless You'Re OK With Surveillance, ' Founder of Rival Telegram Messenger Warns[72] WhatsApp is a 'Trojan horse' exploited to snoop on millions of users naive enough to believe that the Facebook-owned messenger differs from its parent company, long beset by privacy scandals, Telegram founder Pavel Durov said. In a lengthy post on his Telegram channel on Wednesday, Durov took aim at one of his brainchild's biggest rivals — WhatsApp, the world's leading messaging app, which became a Facebook subsidiary in 2014 and boasts some 1.5 billion monthly active users. 'Regardless of the underlying intentions of WhatsApp's parent company, the advice for their end-users is the same: Unless you are cool with all your photos and messages becoming public one day, you should delete WhatsApp from your phone.' The Russian-born entrepreneur pulled no punches, citing a long record of privacy-related violations by Facebook to back up his case. 'WhatsApp doesn't only fail to protect your WhatsApp messages — this app is being consistently used as a Trojan horse to spy on your non-WhatsApp photos and messages. Why would they do it? Facebook has been part of surveillance programs long before it acquired WhatsApp.' In his stinging attack on the messenger, Durov also recounted a recent discovery of yet another system vulnerability in WhatsApp, which allowed hackers to send a specially crafted MP3 file to Android and iOS users and thereby obtain access to all their data.[73]  Eddie Gallagher Controversy: Esper Fires Navy Secretary, Seal Will Keep Trident Pin, Pentagon Says[74] Defense Secretary Mark Esper fired Navy Secretary Richard Spencer Sunday over his handling of the case of a Navy SEAL who posed for a photo next to an Islamic State terrorist's corpse in Iraq, and the SEAL will be able to keep his Trident pin, a Pentagon spokesman said Sunday.[75]  Far-Left Guardian, Julia Wong Deliberately Omit Key Facts in Piece Smearing Breitbart[76] In a breach of journalistic ethics, the far-left British newspaper Guardian deliberately omitted key facts in a recently published smear job of Breitbart News and is refusing to come clean about the article, including the decision to allow the discredited Southern Poverty Law Center to make disparaging claims while leaving out Breitbart's responses. When reached by phone for comment, senior technology reporter Julia Carrie Wong refused to answer questions about the inaccuracies in her Guardian story, referring all queries to her editor. She then hung up the phone on a Breitbart News reporter. Later, she rushed to portray herself as a victim by posting screenshots of Breitbart's questions to her on Twitter.[77]  He's in: Bloomberg Launches Candidacy for President[78] Michael Bloomberg has entered the already-crowded Democratic presidential field. Bloomberg, 77, had earlier in November filed a statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission and filed to appear on some state Democratic primary ballots that had early deadlines, but aides said at the time that the moves were formalities while he decided on launching a full campaign.[79]  Islam is Not Compatible With Civilized Society[80] One of the most ridiculous things I see in the form of a bumper sticker is the one using religious symbols spelling out Coexist. I don't know why but I don't think I've ever seen a man driving a car with that sticker. I'm not trying to be sexist, just truthful. It is obvious that the people that have that sticker don't have the ability to think for themselves. I'm not being rude, I'm pointing out the obvious. If one takes the time to even lightly research the history of islam, they would scrape that sticker off of their car because there is no historical evidence that islam can co-exist with other religions. The only time they do is when there are so few islamists that they have no ability to be the force they want to be. People say that they are 'co-existing' in America now so they can co-exist. Looking at the statistics they are one of the smallest minorities in America. Recent political debates over Muslim immigration and related issues have prompted many people to ask how many Muslims actually live in the United States. But coming up with an answer is not easy, in part because the U.S. Census Bureau does not ask questions about religion, meaning there is no official government count of the U.S. Muslim population. Still, based on our own survey and demographic research, as well as outside sources, Pew Research Center estimates that there were about 3.45 million Muslims of all ages living in the U.S. in 2017, and that Muslims made up about 1.1% of the total U.S. population. Even though they are a very small minority it hasn't stopped them from flexing their muscle here. Keep in mind that muslims immigrate for only one reason and that is to begin the take over of the government where they immigrate. A document was found in Falls Church, Virginia in 2004 that explains, in part, their overall plan: The following is the official document from a 1991 meeting which outlines the Muslim Brotherhood's strategic goals for North America. The document was entered as evidence in the 2008 Holy Land Terror Funding Trial. Federal investigators found the document in the home of Ismael Elbarasse, a founder of the Dar Al-Hijrah mosque in Falls Church, Virginia, during a 2004 search. Elbarasse was a member of the Palestine Committee, which the Muslim Brotherhood had created to support Hamas in the United States.[81]  Islam is Not Compatible With Civilized Society, Part 2[82] Taking a closer look at islam we have to question any sane person that converts from Christianity to islam. We hear that it is a 'religion of peace' but in reality, it is an ideology of hate and debauchery and blood. In the book, Tears of Jihad, it is estimated that islam has massacred about 270 million people in its demand that all peoples follow their so-called prophet.[83]  Not a Single Team Has Called Colin Kaepernick Since Workout[84] Colin Kaepernick showcased his skills for NFL teams just over a week ago at a workout at a local Atlanta high school.[85]  Rep. Devin Nunes: We Are Taking CNN and Daily Beast Into Federal Court After Thanksgiving! (Video)[86] Nunes announced on Friday that he was thinking about suing CNN and The Daily Beast after they ran with fake hit pieces on him meeting former Ukrainian Prosecutor Victor Shokin in Vienna. On Sunday Nunes told Maria Bartiromo that he intends to file charges after Thanksgiving in federal court. Rep. Nunes: I'm the last guy who wants to go to into the court. But the media has become totally corrupt that now they're willing to actually engage and help with criminals, indicted criminals. These people are sick and the only way they're going to be held accountable is through the courts.[87]  Rudy Giuliani Reveals He Has a Kill Switch to Release Biden Family Crime Docs 'If He Disappears' (Video)[88] President Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani in on fire and put the DC swamp and their liberal media stenographers on notice on Saturday. Giuliani reminded the DC swamp that he previously cleaned up mafia in New York and asked them, 'Do you honestly think I'm intimidated?' Giuliani appeared on Fox News and told host Ed Henry that because he's the messenger exposing the Biden-Ukraine corruption that the liberal DC press suppressed, 'they're going to kill him.' 'Are you afraid, Mr. Mayor that you could be indicted?' Ed Henry asked Giuliani. 'Oh, wow, how long have you known me, Ed?' Giuliani asked, adding, 'Do you think I'm afraid? Do you think I get afraid? I did the right thing. I represented my client in a very very effective way. I was so effective that I've discovered a pattern of corruption that the Washington press has been covering up for three or four years.' 'You should have jumped all over this in 2015 when this awful conflict was mentioned and it was hidden and suppressed by the Washington press,' Giuliani added. 'But you know that the reality is, I'm embarrassing you because you didn't do your job and I'm also going to bring out a pay-for-play scheme in the Obama administration that will be devastating to the Democrat Party.' 'I expected the moment I heard Biden's name, I told my colleagues they're going to try to kill me,' he said. 'Because they're going to kill the messenger. But damn it, the mafia couldn't kill me, your colleagues are not going to kill me.' This was an explosive exchange between Giuliani and Ed Henry![89]  The .223 Solution[90] How Do You Engage With Someone Who Says You Need to be Killed? The violence against anyone to the Right of Stalin is ongoing . The other day I wore my RJC Trump kippa I was actually worried.

Kennedy on November 22, 1963, is a seminal occurrence in recent American history. Probably with the exception of the 9/11 events, nothing has affected the American mind and soul more than the JFK assassination. Despite the concerted efforts of the U.S. Government, the media and the academia to promote the 'lone nut' narrative, ever since Kennedy was assassinated many Americans have suspected foul play. Moreover, they suspect that their President was the victim of a huge conspiracy involving people at the highest levels in the U.S. Government. In the spring of 1964, less than a year after the assassination, one third of the people interviewed by pollsters believed that Lee Harvey Oswald, the alleged 'lone assassin,' actually acted in complicity with others. Within two years that number doubled. Since then, every poll taken has shown between 60% to 80% of Americans believe that President Kennedy was killed as a result of a conspiracy. They are not wrong. In 1978 the House Select Committee on Assassinations confirmed the suspicion that JFK was assassinated as the result of conspiracy. According to the Committee Summary of Findings, 'The committee believes, on the basis of the evidence available to it, that President John F. Kennedy was probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy.' Nevertheless, most 'serious' investigators who have studied the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and whose books have been published by 'prestigious' publishing houses not only have denied the possibility of a conspiracy but have also avoided focusing on the three obvious suspects of the crime: the Central Intelligence Agency, Fidel Castro and David Rockefeller. The CIA had a strong motive to kill President Kennedy. He not only openly showed his lack of appreciation for the Agency's work, but also because, after the Bay of Pigs debacle, he fired CIA Director Allen Dulles and Deputy Director for Plans Richard Bissell, both of them trusted CFR members in charge of covert operations on behalf of the Rockefellers and their fellow members of the military-industrial-banking-complex. Even worse, he threatened to disband the Agency. Castro had also enough reasons to want to get rid of Kennedy, if only because he discovered that Kennedy was trying to assassinate him. Even more important, Castro was the only one among the main suspects who had publicly threatened both John and Robert Kennedy with assassination. Last, but not least, David Rockefeller's visceral hatred for JFK was evidenced in his strong opposition to the President, personally and through his agents in the U.S. Government and the mainstream press. It is known that he orchestrated a political campaign against the young President. Moreover, three of Kennedy's major crises during his term as President, the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion, the confrontation with the steel magnates and the Cuban missile crisis were artificially created by David's CFR agents. Even more important, the CIA, Fidel Castro and David Rockefeller not only had the motive, the means and the opportunity, but also the expertise and the propensity to commit such a crime — the three of them were in the assassination business — and David Rockefeller controlled both Castro and the CIA. Actually, David had created both the CIA and Castro.[93]  Trump-Hating Liberal Gets Vasectomy to 'Fight Climate Change'[94] A man from Montana has gone to the extreme lengths of getting a vasectomy in order to 'fight climate change.'[95]  Tyrannical Rise of Google: Information Theft, Search Engine Manipulation, And the Complete Destruction of Free Thought[96] From Zero Hedge: 'First, we learned Google is in the process of secretly sucking up the personalized healthcare data of up to 50 million Americans without the permission of patients or doctors. This was followed by a detailed report in the Wall Street Journal outlining how the search giant is meddling with its algorithms far more aggressively than executives lead people to believe.' So crime does pay after all — after these revelations, Alphabet the parent company of Google, — saw their stock value increase. 'It's important to note that while much of the recent focus on tech giants revolves around market dominance and anti-competitiveness, the real danger posed is far more extensive. Particularly since the post-election 'panic of 2016,' these companies have begun to more earnestly morph into digital information gatekeepers in the name of empire and the national security state. Day by day, tweaked algorithm by tweaked algorithm, and with each new thought-criminal banished from major digital platforms, we've seen not only dissident views marginalized, but we've also lost a capacity to access information we're looking for should tech company CEOs or their national security state partners deem it inappropriate. The powers that be have determined the internet [sic] permitted too much freedom of thought and opinion, so the tech giants stand ready to bluntly throw the hammer down in order to reverse that trend and regain narrative control. The algorithm will be used to get you in line, and if you don't comply, the algorithm will destroy you.' Websites that Google deems as anti-liberal, anti-establishment are buried in the search results or even blacklisted. [Comment: Soon Google will do same to 'Islamaphobia' sites.

According to a report by the Los Angeles Times, UC Berkeley Chancellor Carol Christ announced this week that the university is investigating whether or not they should drop the SAT and ACT exams as requirements for admission.[99]  US Universities in the 'Crosshairs' of a Chinese-Backed Recruitment Operation, Bipartisan Senate Report Finds[100] [] 'Launched in 2008, the Thousand Talents Plan incentivizes individuals engaged in research and development in the United States to transmit the knowledge and research they gain here to China in exchange for monetary payments China unfairly uses the American research and expertise it obtains for its own economic and military gain,' it said. By 2017, China had recruited more than 7,000 professionals, including Nobel laureates, said the 100-page report by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, led by Republican Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio and Democratic Sen. Tom Carper of Delaware.  The report said that the 'U.S. academic community is in the crosshairs of foreign nation states that seek to steal intellectual property.' It noted that in China, military and civilian life are interwoven, making it difficult to detect when U.S.-sponsored research is directly helping the Chinese military. 'The irony is that the U.S. is essentially funding [China's] economic resurgence,' FBI director Christopher Wray told Congress, faulting colleges' 'naivete.'[101]  Virginia Sheriff Will Not Enforce Unconstitutional Gun Laws[102] Amelia County, Virginia, Sheriff Ricky L.

The Tories have made a number of pledges going into the December 12th general election, including extra funding for the NHS, with 50 million more GP surgery appointments every year and 50,000 more nurses. In terms of law and order, the party will continue with its drive to hire 20,000 new police officers and introduce 'tougher sentencing for criminals'.[109]  ESM Reform 'Not a Problem for Italy' — Moscovici[110] Automatic debt restructuring averted says econ commissioner (ANSA) — Rome, November 22 — A planned reform of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) bailout fund is not a problem for Italy, European Economic Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said Friday. He said an 'automatic' mechanism on restructuring debt had been avoided in the reform. Under the reform, Moscovici said, Italy would not end up under the 'tutelage' of the EU. Moscovici added that he had discussed ESM reform with Premier Giuseppe Conte and Economy Miniuster Roberto Gualtieri. The EU is set to sign off next month on a reform that would make the ESM more akin to the IMF, with support for States in financial difficulty made conditional on debt restructuring. Italy is considered by experts to be vulnerable to market turbulence due to its huge public debt of over 2,000 billion euros. The reform was agreed by European finance ministers in June. Premier Conte is said to be thinking about trying to postpone the reform at an EU summit next month. The proposed reform sparked a bad-tempered clash between Conte and opposition leader Matteo Salvini this week. Conte on Wednesday accused rightwing nationalist League leader Salvini of being in a state of delirium after the latter said the former had agreed to the ESM reform in secret. The reform of the eurozone's safety net was negotiated in June, when Salvini was interior minister and deputy premier in Conte's first government. Conte said Salvini had OK'd the reform 'unbeknownst to him', echoing a jibe made years ago about then interior minister Claudio Scajola's denial of the purchase of a flat overlooking the Colosseum. 'Today we have discovered that negotiations have been taking place for a year — there is collective delirium about the ESM that has led the leader of the opposition, the same one who took part in talks on the ESM, and has not realised that he was at the (talks) table without knowing it,' Conte said. Salvini responded by calling Conte a 'liar' and saying that the League had 'always been against the ESM reform'. Plans to reform the ESM are causing turmoil within Conte's government with Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio saying Wednesday that an overhaul of the eurozone's bailout fund that punishes Italy must be averted. 'A reform of the ESM that crushes Italy is not feasible,' 5-Star Movement (M5S) leader Di Maio told Wednesday's Corriere della Sera. In June, when the finance ministers OK'd the reform, Giovanni Tria was Italy's economy minister under Conte's first government, which was backed by the 5-Star Movement (M5S) and the League. Since then Gualtieri of the centre-left Democratic Party (PD) has replaced Tria after a new coalition was formed following League leader Salvini's decision to pull the plug on the first Conte government in August. Conte is reportedly aiming to postpone the overhaul, sources said earlier this week. A reassessment of the sustainability of Italy's debt is 'already envisaged', the Bank of Italy said Wednesday on the proposed reform of the ESM. It said a reform of the ESM's charter 'does not envisage nor announce a mechanism for restructuring sovereign debts'. Gualtieri said Wednesday that 'the reform of the ESM does not in any way introduce the need to preventively restructure the debt to accede to financial support'. He said 'Italy has not needed, does not need, and will not need ESM loans' since its debt 'is sustainable and has a dynamic that is under control, also thanks to the prudent fiscal policy and supporting growth which the country is implementing.[111]  Europe is Falling to Islam. Will America?[112] [] Charles Gave, an economist who published an article on 'The Demographic Suicide of Europe,' wrote that within thirty years, France will submit to Islam. In response, the mainstream press denounced him as 'Islamophobic.' Likewise, when journalist Eric Zemmour wrote that he fears that the fight for the survival of France is 'a battle already lost,' he, too, was accused of 'Islamophobia.' While anti-Muslim attacks are much fewer than anti-Christian or anti-Jewish attacks, and while only a few journalists dare to criticize Islam, French leftists have managed to create the perception that the nation is endangered by a wave of Islamophobia. On November 10, a coalition of left-wing groups organized a 13,000-strong march in Paris against Islamophobia.  During President Obama's eight-year tenure, he developed close ties with the Muslim Brotherhood—an organization that has been labeled as the 'mother of all terrorist groups'—and he actively facilitated the Muslim Brotherhood takeover of Egypt under Mohamed Morsi. Meanwhile, his Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, worked closely with the Organization of the Islamic Cooperation (OIC) on plans to criminalize criticism of Islam. At around the same time, it was revealed that Mrs. Clinton's top aide and close confidant, Huma Abedin, had family members who were deeply enmeshed in Muslim Brotherhood organizations. As it turned out, Ms. Abedin herself worked for several years as a managing editor for a Muslim Brotherhood journal. No matter. When five members of Congress asked for an investigation of Ms. Abedin, they were treated like pariahs. The Obama administration also channeled huge sums of money to Iran's Islamist regime—money which not only advanced Iran's nuclear program, but also enabled it to supply weapons to terrorist groups across the world. Back on the home front, Islamic activist groups such as CAIR, ISNA, and MAS made a great deal of headway under the Obama administration. At the behest of Muslim pressure groups, John Brennan ordered the FBI (then headed by Robert Mueller), the Department of Defense, and other agencies to purge their training programs of any materials that might suggest that Islam was anything other than a model cultural-religious system. At the same time, many Muslim activists were placed in influential and sensitive government positions, including some in Homeland Security. And many are still embedded in the Deep State.[113]  Famous British Comedian Calls Tech Giants 'Greatest Propaganda Machine in History for Hate Groups'[114] British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen, during a recent speech in front of the Anti-Defemation League (ADL), referred to Silicon Valley tech giants — Google Google, Facebook, and Twitter — as 'the greatest propaganda machine in history' for so-called 'hate groups'. During address given to the ADL award ceremony last week, British comedian, lead actor in Borat, the Dictator, and others, blamed leading tech companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter for amplifying the voices of 'hate groups' and helping to spread 'fake news', CNBC reports.[115]  Farage Says UK Needs 'Political Reform' To Drain the Westminster 'Swamp'[116] Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage has suggested that his party may be one day be rebranded the 'Reform Party', saying his colleagues and the British people want an overhaul of the British political system. Speaking to the Daily Express, Mr Farage said: 'We might need to rebrand as the Reform Party. Definitely, our appetite is for political reform. This country wants political reform. It's sick of the whole bloody system. Sick of the whole lot.[117]  Fourteen Years After Cartoon Crisis, Norway Again Knuckles Under to Islam[118] [] On November 16, a group called Stop the Islamization of Norway (Stopp Islamiseringen av Norge — SIAN) had publicly set fire to a copy of the Koran in a garbage can in the city of Kristiansand. The event was attended by more than thirty police officers, who were under secret orders from the chief of the Norwegian police, Marie Benedicte Bjørnland, to try to prevent the burning before it could take place; in fact SIAN managed to set the book alight and it took a few seconds for the police to put out the flames. Bjørnland later defended her directive by citing the so-called 'racism clause' of Norway's criminal law, even though, as legal experts pointed out, that clause does not cover such actions, and the blasphemy law that might conceivably have been used to justify Bjørnland's edict was repealed several years ago. Nonetheless, politicians, commentators, and other public figures directed their criticism not at Bjørnland but at SIAN. On November 23, it was reported that Norway's Minister of Justice, Jøran Kallmyr, was giving Bjørnland his full support. 'Prosecutors,' he explained, 'have determined that burning the Koran can become a crime.' 'Can become a crime'? 'Become', let me interject, is my own translation of the relatively rare expression that Kallmyr used, 'skli over i.' Although his way of expressing his reasoning is frankly somewhat baffling, he definitely did not say that Koran burning is a crime, but rather that it could somehow become a crime. He makes it sound like some kind of alchemical process.[119]  French Policeman Faces Trial for Throwing Stone During Yellow Vest Rally[120] A French policeman appeared in court Thursday for hurling a paving stone at protesters during a Yellow Vest rally, the first member of the security forces to face trial after numerous allegations of police brutality during the weekly protests. The case comes just days after the first anniversary of the anti-government rallies, which were again marked by rioting and vandalism last Saturday. It is the first arising from 212 cases of alleged police brutality being investigated by the IGPN police oversight body.[121]  Gang of 100 Africans Storm Cinema in UK With Machetes, Attacking Everyone, Even Cops[122] A shocking photograph showing a young gang armed with a machete outside a cinema complex has been circulated on social media after a brawl broke out and police officers were attacked. Pockets of fighting erupted in a 100-strong crowd at Star City cinema in Birmingham this afternoon after a 'group of people arrived with machetes'. Several arrests were made and police officers were assaulted as they descended on the scene armed with guard dogs at 5.30pm. It has also been alleged that they were carrying tasers. Families and young children were at the cinema to see Frozen 2. Pictures from the scene show police cars blocking access to the area as a policeman is seen standing with a guard dog. Shocking footage shows young women appearing to push each other as officers try to get control of the situation. Flashing blue lights are also seen as a group of at least eight officers stands on the pavement outside in front of a large crowd. The cucked British media has reported the attackers as 'youths' and 'youngsters'. Not one single British outlet mentioned they were all black Africans.[123]  In a First, Suspected Woman ISIS Member Returned to Germany[124] A woman believed to have belonged to Islamic State (Isis) has arrived back in her home country Germany with her three children, police said on Sunday. The woman is the first adult female Isis member to have been returned through official channels to Germany from Syria. Named only as Laura H, the 30-year-old from Hesse state arrived at Frankfurt airport late on Saturday on a flight from Erbil in Iraq. While Laura H was not immediately arrested on arrival, she remains the subject of an investigation on suspicion of membership of a terrorist organisation as well as failure to properly care for her children, news weekly Der Spiegel reported, citing security sources.[125]  Italy: A. Mittal: Penal Shield Pretext for Pullout — Prosecutors[126] 'Real reason' was 'business crisis' (ANSA) — Milan, November 22 — The lifting of a 'penal shield' protecting managers from legal action over an environmental clean up at the huge ex-ILVA Taranto steelworks is just a 'pretext' for ArcelorMittal's pullout, prosecutors say in a filing in the civil suit between the the Franco-Indian giant and ex-ILVA commissioners. The 'real reason' why ArcelorMittal decided to pull out of a deal to take over the Italian steel group was the 'business crisis' of the Franco-Indian group and their 'consequent desire to disinvest', the filing says, according to a copy seen by ANSA Friday. Premier Giuseppe Conte is set to meet ArcelorMittal owners and managers at 18:30 Friday to try to persuade the group to keep the former ILVA group, which also has smaller plants in Genoa and Novi Ligure and employs a total of nearly 12,000 workers. Testimony from an unidentified ArcelorMittal manager published in the suit on Friday said 'the foreign managers claimed that for the current rate of the works, that is an output of six million tonnes of steel, the quality of raw materials was too high, and we needed to use material of lower quality to bring the costs down'. The managers also said, 'in September they said the money had run out'. If it is persuaded to stay on, ArcelorMittal wants to shed 5,000 jobs in the group. Conte is determined to reduce or cancel that number of job losses. The Taranto works, the biggest in Europe with almost 11,000 workers, has had to have a clean-up aftre its emissions were linked to higher than usual rates of some cancers in the Taranto area. ArcelorMittal has been gradually shutting down production at Taranto over the past week and aims to have all output stopped by December 4. Conte is said to be considering offering the Franco-Indians government help in keeping up production and saving jobs.[127]  Supporters of European Populist Parties Stand Out on Key Issues, From EU to Putin[128] Europe's political environment has been rocked in recent years by the emergence of populist parties, many of which sit on the far right of the political spectrum and question the fundamental value of European integration. These parties generally receive relatively low favorability marks in national surveys, but their supporters stand out on a range of important issues. Below is a look at how supporters of Europe's populist parties compare with nonsupporters on key issues, based on Pew Research Center's 2019 Global Attitudes Survey.[129]  Sweden Checks Over 5,000 Vehicles in New Anti-Gang Border Operation[130] Swedish authorities have stopped and inspected over 5,000 vehicles in 36 hours at the ports of Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Trelleborg as part of a new operation to tackle gang crime networks. The initiative, labelled operation Trident, is set to last a week but has already led to 22 individuals being excluded from the country, broadcaster Sveriges Radio reports.[131]  UK: Prince Andrew Tossed From Buckingham Palace[132] Prince Andrew's relationship with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein has cost him sponsors, his royal duties and is now costing him his digs at Buckingham Palace.[133]  UK: Prince Andrew is to Step Back From All His Charity Patronages as Sources Suggest Prince Charles and Prince William Want Him to Stay Away From Royal Duties Forever[134] Prince Andrew is to 'stand back' from his charity patronages in a sign of his deepening humiliation over the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, it was revealed yesterday. Aides to the Duke of York said he would step aside temporarily, but sources suggested his older brother Prince Charles and nephew Prince William would oppose any future return to royal duties. Charles is expected to fly home to Britain today after a tour of New Zealand, raising the prospect of a showdown between the brothers over Andrew's disastrous decision to speak publicly about his relationship with convicted paedophile Epstein.[135]  UK: Polls Show Tories Could Win 64-Seat Majority, Has 19-Point Lead Over Labour[136] Polling suggests that the Conservative Party could win a 64-seat majority in the House of Commons in the December 12th General Election. The poll of polls conducted by Electoral Calculus and published in The Telegraph has Mr Johnson's party polling at 42.8 per cent, giving him 357 seats in the 650-seat lower house while Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is polling at 30 per cent and is currently predicted to lose 55 seats.[137]  UK: Riot Police Clash With Protesters[138] Riot police gathered outside the Oxford University Union tonight ahead of a speech and Q...ession with French far-right activist Marion Marchal — the niece of National Front leader Marine Le Pen. Tensions grew as approximately 100 protesters shouted and chanted at police, as blockades and officers guarded the entrances to the Union. Police vans lined the entrances outside as officers on horseback patrolled the streets surrounding the prestigious union. Protestors chanted 'Who protects the Nazis? Police protect the Nazis!', and 'Oxford Union shame on you, Le Pen is a Nazi too!', through megaphones and many wore masks and bandanas, as the atmosphere outside grew increasingly threatening.[139]  As Internet Restored, Online Iran Protest Videos Show Chaos[140] DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Machine gun fire answers rock-throwing protesters. Motorcycle-riding Revolutionary Guard volunteers chase after demonstrators. Plainclothes security forces grab, beat and drag a man off the street to an uncertain fate. As Iran restores the internet after a weeklong government-imposed shutdown, new videos purport to show the demonstrations over gasoline prices rising and the security-force crackdown that followed.[141]  Iraq Shaken by One of Its 'Worst' Days of Protests; At Least 13 Killed[142] At least 13 anti-government protesters were killed Sunday by Iraqi security forces in one of the 'worst' days of violence in the country's south amid widespread ongoing demonstrations against corruption, officials said. Since the anti-government protests broke out in early October, at least 342 people have been killed and thousands more wounded in Baghdad and various southern provinces.[143]  Leaked Email Shows Syria Chemical Incident Omitted ...srepresented Key Facts[144] Undermines justification for show of force conducted by US, Britain and France in response to alleged attack in 2018.[145]  Lebanese Protesters Clash With Supporters of Hezbollah, Amal in Beirut[146] BEIRUT (Reuters) — Clashes broke out between anti-government demonstrators and supporters of the Shi'ite groups Hezbollah and Amal in the Lebanese capital, Beirut, early on Monday, as tensions escalated when demonstrators blocked a main bridge.[147]  New Sexed-Up Dossier Furore: Explosive Leaked Email Claims That UN Watchdog's Report Into Alleged Poison Gas Attack by Assad Was Doctored — So Was it to Justify British and American Missile Strikes on Syria?[148] A leaked email last night dramatically indicated that the UN's poison gas watchdog had butchered and censored a critical report on an alleged chemical attack in Syria. If substantiated, the revelations will be severely embarrassing for Britain, France and America, which launched a massive military strike in retaliation without waiting for proof that chemical weapons had actually been used. Unconfirmed reports and videos, showing the corpses of adults and children foaming at the mouth in Douma, a suburb of Damascus, shocked the world in April 2018 and led to a joint Western attack on the supposed culprit, Syria, in which more than 100 missiles, including nearly 70 Tomahawk cruise missiles, were fired. Although the reports and films could not be independently verified, as the alleged events took place in a war zone then under the control of brutal Islamist militants, Western governments, and many Western media, took them at face value.[149]  Bokhari: Microsoft Has a Massive China Problem[150] [] It also has taken steps into politics and news. Through its partnership with NewsGuard, it sought to influence the news site choices of its Mobile Edge browser users. More boldly, Microsoft hopes to be the guarantor of election integrity in the United States — it is developing software called 'ElectionGuard,' which it hopes will be used in ballot booths around the United States. The first ElectionGuard systems will go into action in 2020. Which makes it perplexing that Microsoft is so friendly to China, the United States' most dangerous global rival. Did you know that Bing, Microsoft's search engine, is active in China and censors itself to keep the ruling regime happy? Try searching for terms like 'Dalai Lama' and 'Falun Gong' on Bing's Chinese search engine — you can't. This is, of course, precisely the sort of thing that threw Google into turmoil over 'Project Dragonfly' last year. But it didn't attract nearly as much attention, because, well, it's Bing. And then there's Microsoft-owned LinkedIn, the social network for professionals. More prominent social networks like Facebook and Twitter have largely abandoned attempts to access the Chinese market, aware that it's a political hot potato. But not LinkedIn. Unlike other western social networks, it is not banned in China, and has 41 million users in the country. And, as you'd expect, it censors its Chinese users heavily to enjoy that privilege. Interestingly enough, China also likes to use LinkedIn to recruit spies in America. Two birds with one stone!  This seems like a very specific area of concern — until you realize that Microsoft's AI division is working with a Chinese military university. The work includes matters related to facial recognition.  In another interview last year, Crozier made some more admissions that sound even more startling today — for example, that the viral Chinese-owned app TikTok — which is reportedly facing a national security review by U.S. officials — was hatched in Microsoft's China-based Research ...velopment facility.[151]  Hong Kong Democrats Romp to Local Election Landslide After Months of Protests[152] HONG KONG (Reuters) — Hong Kong's democrats romped to a landslide and symbolic majority in district council elections after residents turned out in record numbers on Sunday to vote following six months of anti-government protests in the embattled city. In a rare weekend lull in the unrest that has rocked the financial hub, democratic candidates across the city of 7.4 million people secured more than half of the 452 district council seats for the first time against a strongly resourced and mobilized pro-establishment opposition.[153]  My Socialist Hell: Mourning the Victims of Venezuela's Healthcare 'Miracle'[154] [] Still, despite all the shortcomings that the public sector has had, it always functioned as best as possible in my youth. That is not the case anymore. Our health crisis has claimed the lives of so many. I will always have the utmost respect for our doctors and health professionals because, despite all of the hardships they face — even having to perform surgery without power — they still work tirelessly and save lives. The continued collapse of the country has affected the private sector as well. You have to bring your own supplies to surgeries, from gauze to bandages or antiseptic products — that's how bad it's gotten. In 2015, a word changed our lives forever: Leiomyosarcoma. My mother was diagnosed with this rare form of cancer in her liver after months of misdiagnosis. What followed was a long two-and-a-half-year fight against this atypical cancer with the country's collapse stacking all odds against her. She fought as hard as she could but, without access to proper chemotherapy and treatment, she passed away on March 31st, 2018.[155]  France: Afghan Migrant to be Tried for Sex Crimes Against 5-Year-Old Girl[156] An adult male Afghan migrant is facing as a two-year prison sentence for allegedly luring a five-year-old girl into his bed and sexually abusing her. The abuse is said to have occurred during April of 2018 when the five-year-old girl and her mother were staying at an apartment shared with three other migrants, two Afghans and a Sudanese national, in the commune of Avranches in Normandy, French newspaper La Manche Libre reports.[157]  Hundreds Protest ICE, Multiple Arrests in Alamance County[158] GRAHAM, N.C. — Hundreds of protesters converged in Alamance County on Sunday to protest the way law enforcement works with ICE officials. As part of an agreement between the Alamance County Sheriff's Office and ICE, undocumented immigrants being detained by ICE are held in the jail. Multiple people were arrested during the protests, but no injuries were reported, according to the Graham Police Department.[159]  Italy Grants Access to Spanish Migrant Rescue Ship[160] ON BOARD THE OPEN ARMS, OFF SICILY (Reuters) — Italian authorities have agreed to grant the Open Arms ship access to a port to disembark 62 African migrants it has been carrying since Wednesday, the founder of the Spanish rescue mission said on Sunday. Oscar Camps said the vessel is set to dock at the southern Italian port of Taranto on Tuesday afternoon, although the eventual destination may change.[161]  Men Arrested for Halloween Gang Rape of 14-Year-Old German Girl Identified as Iraqi, Afghan, And Iranian[162] Authorities in Germany have released the nationalities of the three migrants who were arrested earlier this week for gang-raping a 14-year-old native German girl on Halloween night in the city Ulm. The cowardly rapists, three 'asylum seekers' from Iraq, Afghanistan, and Iran, aged 15, 16, and 26, are currently in police custody. Two additional suspects said to have been involved in the sexual assault remain at large, German Bavarian daily newspaper Münchner Merkur reports. When Voice of Europe initially reported on the gang rape earlier this week, authorities were refusing to release the nationalities of the rapists, claiming that the information is of 'no relevance to the process'. They've since changed their minds. Police spokesperson Wolfgang Jürgens has told the German press that despite there being only five suspects in the case, it cannot be ruled out there may have been additional men involved in the crime.[163]  Over 800 Migrants Set Sail for Italy in One Week as Numbers Rise[164] In the past week, around 800 migrants have attempted to reach Italy from North Africa as migrant transport NGO activity has resumed the flow of migrants in the Mediterranean. The NGO ships account for facilitating 367 of the 800, many of whom were intercepted by coastguards. The France-based NGO Sos Mediterrane and its ship the Ocean Viking currently has 215 migrants aboard her, Il Giornale reports.[165]  Somali Migrant Attacks Swiss Bus Driver, Attempts to Hijack the Vehicle[166] Police arrested an intoxicated Somali migrant in St. Gallen, Switzerland, after he attacked a female bus driver and attempted to steal her vehicle. The 29-year-old Somali was reportedly arguing with another individual at the bus stop, and the altercation continued after both had boarded. Police said that the bus driver attempted to calm the two men, leading to the attack by the Somalian migrant.[167]  San Diego State 'Pronouns 101' Event: Misgendering a Person is Like Stabbing Them[168] San Diego State University is encouraging students to use gender-neutral terms like 'folks' instead of terms like 'guys' as part of a larger effort to eradicate gendered language on campus. One presenter told students that being misgendered is 'like being stabbed.' According to a report by The College Fix, administrators at San Diego State University are encouraging students to do away with gendered terms like 'guys' in favor of gender-neutral alternatives like 'folks.'[169]  Life in Cosmos May Depend on 4 Key Ingredients[170] In 1992, astronomers Aleksander Wolszczan and Dale Frail were observing a pulsar star located some 2,300 lightyears away when they noticed something strange. The usually regular rhythm of its pulsating light seemed to be skipping a beat. The reason behind its off-beat pulse led to a discovery that would change the course of astronomical exploration: The star had two planets orbiting around it. These were the first planets ever observed outside of our Solar System. And so, the study of exoplanets — and the search for those that may support life like that found on Earth — was born. So what essential ingredients do you need for life? Inverse spoke to the experts to find out what they think are the key factors for habitability elsewhere in the universe.[171] [ 1]: #378008 [ 2]: #378016 [ 3]: #377983 [ 4]: #377961 [ 5]: #377967 [ 6]: #378030 [ 7]: #377991 [ 8]: #377975 [ 9]: #378010 [ 10]: #377981 [ 11]: #378032 [ 12]: #377936 [ 13]: #377938 [ 14]: #377977 [ 15]: #377963 [ 16]: #377965 [ 17]: #377957 [ 18]: #377942 [ 19]: #377973 [ 20]: #377940 [ 21]: #378028 [ 22]: #377947 [ 23]: #377979 [ 24]: #377985 [ 25]: #377994 [ 26]: #378044 [ 27]: #377959 [ 28]: #377951 [ 29]: #377998 [ 30]: #378042 [ 31]: #377955 [ 32]: #378014 [ 33]: #377971 [ 34]: #378022 [ 35]: #377958 [ 36]: #378048 [ 37]: #378036 [ 38]: #377989 [ 39]: #378020 [ 40]: #378040 [ 41]: #378046 [ 42]: #378006 [ 43]: #378000 [ 44]: #377987 [ 45]: #378002 [ 46]: #378018 [ 47]: #377945 [ 48]: #378004 [ 49]: #377953 [ 50]: #377996 [ 51]: #378012 [ 52]: #378024 [ 53]: #377969 [ 54]: #378034 [ 55]: #378038 [ 56]: #378026 [ 57]: #378050 [ 58]:  [ 59]: #topheadline [ 60]:             [ 61]: #topheadline [ 62]:            / [ 63]: #topheadline [ 64]:             [ 65]: #topheadline [ 66]:             [ 67]: #topheadline [ 68]:             [ 69]: #topheadline [ 70]:             [ 71]: #topheadline [ 72]:             [ 73]: #topheadline [ 74]:             [ 75]: #topheadline [ 76]:             [ 77]: #topheadline [ 78]:             [ 79]: #topheadline [ 80]:            / [ 81]: #topheadline [ 82]:            / [ 83]: #topheadline [ 84]:             [ 85]: #topheadline [ 86]:             [ 87]: #topheadline [ 88]:             [ 89]: #topheadline [ 90]:             [ 91]: #topheadline [ 92]:            / [ 93]: #topheadline [ 94]:             [ 95]: #topheadline [ 96]:            / [ 97]: #topheadline [ 98]:             [ 99]: #topheadline [ 100]:             [ 101]: #topheadline [ 102]:             [ 103]: #topheadline [ 104]:            / [ 105]: #topheadline [ 106]:            / [ 107]: #topheadline [ 108]:             [ 109]: #topheadline [ 110]:             [ 111]: #topheadline [ 112]:             [ 113]: #topheadline [ 114]:             [ 115]: #topheadline [ 116]:             [ 117]: #topheadline [ 118]:             [ 119]: #topheadline [ 120]:             [ 121]: #topheadline [ 122]:             [ 123]: #topheadline [ 124]:             [ 125]: #topheadline [ 126]:             [ 127]: #topheadline [ 128]:             [ 129]: #topheadline [ 130]:             [ 131]: #topheadline [ 132]:             [ 133]: #topheadline [ 134]:             [ 135]: #topheadline [ 136]:             [ 137]: #topheadline [ 138]:             [ 139]: #topheadline [ 140]:             [ 141]: #topheadline [ 142]:             [ 143]: #topheadline [ 144]:            / [ 145]: #topheadline [ 146]:             [ 147]: #topheadline [ 148]:             [ 149]: #topheadline [ 150]:             [ 151]: #topheadline [ 152]:             [ 153]: #topheadline [ 154]:             [ 155]: #topheadline [ 156]:             [ 157]: #topheadline [ 158]:             [ 159]: #topheadline [ 160]:             [ 161]: #topheadline [ 162]:             [ 163]: #topheadline [ 164]:             [ 165]: #topheadline [ 166]:             [ 167]: #topheadline [ 168]:             [ 169]: #topheadline [ 170]:             [ 171]: #topheadline
