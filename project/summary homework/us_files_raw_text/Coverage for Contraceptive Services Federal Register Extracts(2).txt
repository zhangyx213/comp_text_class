I. Background
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Pub. L. 111-148) was enacted on March 23, 2010. The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Pub. L. 111-152) was enacted on March 30, 2010. These statutes are collectively known as the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act reorganizes, amends, and adds to the provisions of part A of title XXVII of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) relating to group health plans and health insurance issuers in the group and individual markets. The Affordable Care Act adds section 715(a)(1) to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and section 9815(a)(1) to the Internal Revenue Code (Code) to incorporate the provisions of part A of title XXVII of the PHS Act into ERISA and the Code, and to make those provisions applicable to group health plans and health insurance issuers providing health insurance coverage in connection with group health plans. The sections of the PHS Act incorporated into ERISA and the Code are sections 2701 through 2728.
Section 2713 of the PHS Act, as added by the Affordable Care Act and incorporated into ERISA and the Code, requires that non-grandfathered group health plans and health insurance issuers offering non-grandfathered group or individual health insurance coverage provide coverage of certain specified preventive services without cost sharing. These preventive services include preventive care and screenings for women provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). On August 1, 2011, the Departments amended regulations to cover women's preventive services provided for in HRSA guidelines, /1/ and HRSA adopted and released such guidelines, which were based on recommendations of the independent organization, the National Academy of Medicine (formerly Institute of Medicine). The preventive services identified in the HRSA guidelines include all Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved contraceptives, sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling for women with reproductive capacity, as prescribed by a health care provider (collectively, contraceptive services). /2/

FOOTNOTE 2 The HRSA guidelines exclude services relating to a man's reproductive capacity, such as vasectomies and condoms. END FOOTNOTE
The Departments issued regulations that provide an accommodation for eligible organizations that object on religious grounds to providing coverage for contraceptive services. /3/ Under the accommodation, an eligible organization does not have to contract, arrange, pay, or provide a referral for contraceptive coverage. At the same time, the accommodation generally ensures that women enrolled in the health plan established by the eligible organization, like women enrolled in health plans maintained by other employers, receive contraceptive coverage seamlessly--that is, through the same issuers or third party administrators that provide or administer the rest of their health coverage, and without financial, logistical, or administrative obstacles. /4/ Minimizing such obstacles is essential to achieving the purpose of the Affordable Care Act's preventive services provision, which seeks to remove barriers to the use of preventive services and to ensure that women receive full and equal health coverage appropriate to their medical needs.
FOOTNOTE 3 26 CFR 54.9815-2713A, 29 CFR 2590.715-2713A, 45 CFR 147.131. END FOOTNOTE
FOOTNOTE 4 An accommodation is also available with respect to student health insurance coverage arranged by eligible organizations that are institutions of higher education. 45 CFR 147.131(f). For ease of use, this RFI refers only to "employers" with religious objections to the contraceptive-coverage requirement, but references to employers with respect to insured group health plans should also be considered to include institutions of higher education that are eligible organizations with respect to student health insurance coverage.
