The study objectives are to present the Sperm Bank development in United States, Europe and China.Sperm bank can be defined as an establishment where the semen is stored in cold conditions for artificial insemination at a later stage. It makes use of cryopreservation freezers to freeze the semen samples. 
A large number of couples take up artificial insemination to start a family using sperm banks. These institutions also aid individuals with reproductive problems. The sperm banks support the notion of raising awareness among men regarding the reduction in fertility potential and exposure to reproductive hazards from the environment leading to the option of semen storage. It is a practice followed quite often for individuals facing orchiectomy, chemotherapy, vasectomy, and radiation therapy.During 2017, the semen analysis segment accounted for the major shares of the sperm bank market. Factors such as the increasing demand for insemination procedures around the world and the availability of numerous semen analysis tests, will contribute to the growth of this industry segment in the coming years.This market study estimates that in terms of geographic regions, the Americas will be the major revenue contributor to the sperm bank market throughout the forecast period.
