Good Tuesday morning.

Happy Primary Day!
First, please take a moment to look at 'The County Election' by George Bingham.
George Caleb Bingham painted a series of canvasses celebrating elections in newly created states along the western frontier.

Here, gathered around the polling place, is a crowd of characters, including the happy drunk whose vote has been bought with liquor and the downcast loyalist whose candidate has lost and who bows his head with more than a hangover. The sole African American - excluded from the voting process - stands at the left edge of the canvas, serving hard cider. Women are notably absent from the scene.

With every Primary (or any election, for that matter), there are clear winners and losers; others prove more elusive to pin down.
Once again, Florida Politics is assembling an (arguably) comprehensive look at the 2024 Florida Primaries' winners and losers-who was up, down or somewhere between.
That said, we ask you - our loyal Sunburn readers - for input.

From candidates and campaigns to staff, issues - and maybe a reporter or two: Which person, group, or topic earned a coveted spot on the list of 'Winners and Losers from the 2024 Florida Primary?'
We'll cover the obvious ones, like the losing candidates. We are looking for a few off-the-beaten-path choices or out-of-the-box suggestions.
Please send suggestions to  for consideration.
- SITUATIONAL AWARENESS -
-@TrumpWarRoom: In the just released Democrat Party platform, 'Biden's second term' appears a grand total of 19 times. It's hilarious incompetence, but it's also the truth. Kamala's presidency would be a Biden second term. A continuation of his broken economy, broken border and broken world.

- TOP STORY -
' 
Local races, including School Board seats, will be the main motivators for voters to go to the polls as Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis pushes for conservatives to win seats in several districts.

While Scott technically has a Primary, he is expected to win easily over two minor candidates with little name identification or money. He has the power of incumbency along with the backing of his party and has already spent about $27 million on his re-election, including millions of his personal money.
The leading candidate in the Democratic Primary is former U.S. Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell. In 2018, she became the first Ecuadorian American and first South American-born woman elected to Congress. She lost her seat after one term.
Mucarsel-Powell has the backing of party leaders and has raised $12 million for the race. Scott is already campaigning as if she will be his opponent, but she first faces Navy veteran and businessperson Stanley Campbell, Army veteran and businessman Rod Joseph and Brian Rush, a former four-term Florida State Representative.
Incumbents are running for 27 of the state's 28 House seats, and all should be safe in the Primary, barring any surprises. Republican Bill Posey now holds the one open seat in a conservative district along Florida's central Atlantic coast.
Posey announced his retirement hours after former Senate President Mike Haridopolos qualified for the race. He immediately backed Haridopolos, who now faces tech businessman John Hearton. The winner of the GOP Primary will be the favorite to win in November. Democrats Sandy Kennedy and Daniel McDow are seeking the Democratic nomination.

But not this time.
There are moments in history when citizens of a great nation choose which path to take and, in doing so, embrace their destiny.
Our choice is progress.
Our choice is looking to the future and continuing the never-ending pursuit of 'forming a more perfect union.' Building a better, more prosperous and fairer nation for all Americans, for every man, every woman, every child, every family and every small-business owner who remains dedicated to the proposition that if you work hard, you should have a fair shot at the American Dream.
