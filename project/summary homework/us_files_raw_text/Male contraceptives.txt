This site popped up with a bold mission statement: "We believe that men can, and should, have access to contraceptive options beyond condoms and vasectomy." The site proclaims a man's right to participate in family planning.
Much of the material is advocacy, especially the button on "myths and facts." Among the myths the site says it wants to dispel: Men want minimal involvement in birth control, and male contraceptive pills or injections are more difficult to develop than birth-control methods for women. Nevertheless, the site still must admit that abstinence, condoms and vasectomy are the only reliable forms of male birth control. It presents a number of links and information on the state of research for male pills and injections.
