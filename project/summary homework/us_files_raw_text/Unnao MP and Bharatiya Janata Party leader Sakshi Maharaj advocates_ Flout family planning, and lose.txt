Bharatiya Janata Party leader and Unnao MP Sakshi Maharaj demanded a strong law for population control and family planning and suggested that voting rights of those flouting the law be revoked. He then waded into controversy by stating that while Hindus opted for vasectomy and tubectomy, Muslims avoided it. "This is wrong as law should be same for everyone," he said.
When asked about Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut's article in party mouthpiece 'Samana' that suggested revocation of Muslims' voting rights if they do not participate in family planning, the Unnao MP said, "Family planning is a Government of India initiative to check population growth. But Muslims do not adhere to it. At the time of independence, country's population was only 30 crore. Today we are 130 crores. Who is responsible for it?"
Lamenting that politics of Muslim appeasement had ruined the country, the Unnao MP said that there was no scope of appeasement in Modi era."If a Hindu goes to a temple he has to pay tax whereas a particular community is offered subsidy to travel outside the country," he said.
On reservation, he said governments would have to rethink on reservation as it cannot continue for long. 2015 Legal Monitor Worldwide.
