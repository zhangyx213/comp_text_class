THE FATE OF a Brooklyn federal jail officer accused of raping an inmate is in the hands of a jury.
Carlos Martinez is accused of forcing a woman to have sex with him while he was a lieutenant at Sunset Park's Metropolitan Detention Center, prosecutor's said.
Martinez allegedly took the inmate into an office without a surveillance cameras and kept her quiet with threats of shipping her to solitary confinement.
The 48-year-old also bought the woman a morning-after pill, even though he had a vasectomy, prosecutors said.
A jury of eight men and four women started deliberating Wednesday afternoon.
The key witness in the week-long trial was Martinez's alleged victim, a woman the prosecution and defense called "Maria."
In their closing arguments, both sides focused on the three days of testimony from Maria, who was in custody on drug-related convictions.
Martinez's lawyer, Anthony Ricco, said prosecutors couldn't prove his client used force and fear.
"Giving an abortion-type pill doesn't prove you raped her," Ricco argued, adding that Maria "came before you with a sophisticated lie."
Martinez's status inside the prison made him think he could get away with rape, Assistant U.S. Attorney Nadia Shihata said. Maria might be a felon, Shihata said, but "she's also a human being, a woman."
He faces up to life in prison if convicted.
