* I bet all the people without health insurance and those who can barely afford it are happy to know that doctors and drug salesmen are eating at L'Auberge.
* I am wondering why the "good neighbor" from West Carrollton who was willing to let the Dayton City Schools have its new superintendent (Jan. 18) chose the "Speak Up" column to offer his generosity. Why not a letter to the editor? Maybe because a letter requires a signature?
* Re Elian Gonzalez: From my understanding, the law regarding refugees is that if they make it to land, they can stay, but if they are found in the water, they go back. Why are we having all this hoopla? Didn't they find Elian in the water?
* Prison inmates have privileges because they are human and they have rights like those of us who are free. Prison inmates' suits can be filed when prisoners' rights are violated. A Feb. 6 caller on this topic needs a demonstration of human rights.
* Re Catholic Schools Week: The reason most of these schools have school of excellence awards is because they do not cater to physically or mentally handicapped children. They told several of my ADD children not to take proficiency tests and bring the school's average down. They promise help for these children over and over again, but help is never given.
* Shame on the Dayton Daily News! In its first installment of the Erica Baker series ('Little girl lost: The search for Erica Baker), it got way too personal about the Baker family. Personal matters such as drug problems, the vasectomy and their living arrangements are really none of our business. All we want to read about is Erica's disappearance and what is being done to return her safely home.
* When Dayton City Commissioner Mary Wiseman was voted in, I knew it would be a matter of time until she would be pushing her lifestyle down our throats. There would have been no flip-flopping if the commissioners would have used their brains to realize what Wiseman was really pushing.
* I got my small piece of Dayton Daily News and thought: Is this all I get for my 50 cents? It doesn't even have all of the local news, let alone outside news. I'm thinking of changing to USA Today twice a week to keep up with what's going on in the world. 
* If a tax cut stimulates the economy and the economy is red hot, who would want to have a tax cut at this time? I don't know what the Republicans are thinking about. Obviously, its's not the economy.
