Since the snow melted, I've counted 17,216 rabbits in the area, give or take a few dozen. I've never seen so many.
They're everywhere, all sizes, eating everything that grows. Rabbit holes appear every 4 feet. You can hardly take a walk or bike ride without them underfoot.
Now I like the cotton-tailed fuzzies - even had one as a pet. But the swelling bunny battalions have become a menace. So lettuce work toward what I consider a non-lethal, humane 24-carrot solution: Bunny Birth Control.
I know birth control can be a controversial subject. But there comes a time when overpopulation threatens our way of life.
So, for the good of Dane County, here's how I propose we resolve this dilemma. Convince the bunnies to restrict their numbers of offspring by such foolproof methods as tubal ligation, vasectomies, use of bunny condoms or the ever popular abstinence - just say "no."
How do they get the message? Set up a Warren Commission of volunteers. Bring in the big name persuaders who speak their language. Persuaders such as Bugs Bunny, the Easter Bunny, Little Bunny Foo Foo, Flopsy, Mopsy, Cottontail and Peter.
We love our long-eared, short-tailed lagomorph mammals with the long hind legs. But there are just too many. We must take action.
You betcha.
