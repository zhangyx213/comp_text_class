Epstein, Randi Hutter. Aroused: The History of Hormones and How They Control Just About Everything. Norton. Jun. 2018. 272p. photos. notes. index. ISBN 9780393239607. $26.95; ebk. ISBN 9780393651119. HEALTH
Hormones regulate most of the body's physiological processes. Metabolism, immunity, sleep, mood, sexual development and desire, and the ability to fight and flee from danger all depend on them. Epstein, a physician at Yale and Columbia, presents a history of the scientific discoveries that led to knowledge of the existence of these powerful substances. The author introduces the colorful researchers who performed experiments that would never be permitted with current ethical regulations: William Bayliss and Ernest Starling, who discovered the role of the pancreas in digestion and angered anti-vivisectionists in the process; Louis Berman, who thought that hormones caused criminal behavior; and Eugen Steinach, who touted vasectomies to preserve male strength. Readers learn of snake oil cures and the important therapeutic roles that hormones play. Transplanting goat testicles led to disaster, but using insulin for diabetes and replacing thyroid and adrenal hormones when they are deficient saves lives. VERDICT An engaging book of medical history that teaches readers about important aspects of physiology.—Barbara Bibel, formerly Oakland P.L.
