A GOOD DAY FOR A VASECTOMY?
A trusted reader indicated that a couple months back he called to schedule a vasectomy appointment for the morning of April 5 - today, of course - thinking he was clever and would get to spend recovery time watching the Masters.
The woman booking his appointment - without hearing his reason for picking that day - replied, "Golf fan?" He was stunned. She went on to tell him that the days surrounding the Masters often book up months in advance, and that he was hardly the first person to have that idea.
Calls on Wednesday to several local clinics that perform the procedure produced no concrete corroborating evidence; instead, either laughter (in a couple of cases) or uncomfortable and brief conversations (in several others) were the norm. One kind voice said, "It sounds logical." We'll have to leave it at that.
KIND OF CHANGES THE MEANING
The April issue of "Referee" magazine features a funny quote from MLB umpire Wally Bell which originally ran in the Canton (Ohio) Repository. The only problem? The original version we found at cantonrep.com reads like this: "If I'm working a series where one of the managers is easy to get along with - Lou Piniella, Ron Gardenhire, Eric Wedge, Mike Hargrove - I'll walk over to the bench and sit down," Bell said. "I'll look at them and say, `Yep, I can see really good from here. It's a great place to call balls and strikes.' "
In "Referee" magazine? The quote is exactly the same, except "is easy to get along with" is changed to "is not easy to get along with."
