 Data:Generation Lab;Chart: Simran Parwani/Axios Over half of young women aged 18-29 say they would get an abortion if they had an unwanted or unplanned pregnancy — even if it was illegal, according to a new Generation Lab flash poll first provided to Axios. 
Why it matters: Last week's news that the Supreme Court is prepared to overturn Roe v. Wade[1] has raised questions on what access would look like without a federal right to an abortion. Even in states where they remain legal[2], abortions could be harder to access because those clinics could be flooded with patients from states that have cracked down. Women in their 20s accounted for the majority of abortions[3] between 2010 and 2019. By the numbers: 56% of respondents who identified as women said they would seek out an abortion provider even if it was illegal and they had an unwanted or unplanned pregnancy. 34% said they would have the baby in the event abortion was illegal, while 10% said they'd attempt to end the pregnancy at home.45% of respondents who identified as men said they would take additional precautions like using physical contraceptives more often if abortion were illegal, while 43% said they would not change anything and 11% said they would be more likely to get a vasectomy.49% of all respondents said abortion should be legal in all cases, 27% said it should be legal in most cases, 16% said it should be illegal in most cases and 8% said it should be illegal in all cases.46% of respondents said they have a "mostly unfavorable" opinion of the Supreme Court, while 22% said their opinion was "very unfavorable." 28% said it was "mostly favorable," and only 4% said they had a "very favorable" opinion. The big picture: Approximately six in 10 U.S. adults believe abortion should be legal in "all or most cases," according to a recent Pew Research Center survey[4]. Abortion clinics are already preparing to shift people and resources away[5] from red states, while blue states are taking steps to plan for a potential influx in patients if Roe falls. Methodology: This poll surveyed 813 people ranging from ages 18 to 29 between May 5 and 8. 460 people self-identified as women and 353 self-identified as men.
