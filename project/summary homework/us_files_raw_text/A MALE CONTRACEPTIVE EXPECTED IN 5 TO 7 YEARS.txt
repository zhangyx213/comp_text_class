Pharmaceutical companies Schering and Organon said Thursday they plan to develop a marketable hormone contraceptive for men.
Trials for the product -- a long-term implant accompanied by an injection every three months -- will start next year.
The goal is to have a product ready for the U.S. and European markets in five to seven years.
The implant would release the hormone progestin to stop production of both sperm and the male hormone testosterone. Injections of a testosterone derivative would replace natural levels of the hormone, necessary for normal sexual functioning.
University and non-profit researchers have been testing similar methods in Australia, Britain and the United States, but the two companies would be the first commercial entities with a salable product.
Melissa May, a spokeswoman for the non-profit Population Council in New York, which has carried out research into male hormonal contraception, said the development was "long overdue."
Condoms and vasectomy have drawbacks, and a male contraceptive might appeal to couples in which the woman couldn't use birth control pills.
Organon, which has bases in Westland, N.J., and Ostend, the Netherlands, would make the implant -- a version of its already existing Implanon female birth control implant.
Schering, of Berlin, would produce the injected testosterone derivative, called testosterone undecanoate.
Development of a male contraceptive has faced a biological hurdle: It's easier to stop one egg a month in women than the millions of sperm produced every day in men.
