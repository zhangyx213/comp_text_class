SUMMARY: This document proposes amendments to rules regarding coverage for certain preventive services under section 2713 of the Public Health Service Act, as added by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended, and incorporated into the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code. Section 2713 of the Public Health Service Act requires coverage without cost sharing of certain preventive health services, including certain contraceptive services, in non-exempt, non-grandfathered group health plans and health insurance coverage. The proposed rules would amend the authorization to exempt group health plans established or maintained by certain religious employers (and group health insurance coverage provided in connection with such plans) with respect to the requirement to cover contraceptive services. The proposed rules would also establish accommodations for group health plans established or maintained by eligible organizations (and group health insurance coverage offered in connection with such plans), including student health insurance coverage arranged by eligible organizations that are religious institutions of higher education. This document also proposes related amendments to regulations concerning excepted benefits and Affordable Insurance Exchanges.

I. Background
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Pub. L. 111-148) was enacted on March 23, 2010, and amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Pub. L. 111-152) on March 30, 2010. These statutes are referred to collectively as the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act reorganizes, amends, and adds to the provisions of part A of title XXVII of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) relating to group health plans and health insurance issuers in the group and individual markets. The Affordable Care Act adds section 715(a)(1) to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and section 9815(a)(1) to the Internal Revenue Code (Code) to incorporate the provisions of part A of title XXVII of the PHS Act into ERISA and the Code, and to make them applicable to group health plans. The PHS Act sections incorporated by these references are sections 2701 through 2728.
Section 2713 of the PHS Act, as added by the Affordable Care Act and incorporated into ERISA and the Code, requires that non-grandfathered group health plans and health insurance issuers offering non-grandfathered group or individual health insurance coverage provide benefits for certain preventive health services without the imposition of cost sharing. These preventive health services include, with respect to women, preventive care and screenings as provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA).
The Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS), Labor, and the Treasury (collectively, the Departments) published interim final rules with a request for comments implementing section 2713 of the PHS Act in the July 19, 2010 Federal Register (75 FR 41726) (2010 interim final rules). Among other things, the 2010 interim final rules provide that a plan or issuer must provide coverage, without cost sharing, for certain newly recommended preventive health services starting with the first plan year (or, in the individual market, policy year) that begins on or after the date that is one year after the date on which the recommendation or guideline is issued. /1/
FOOTNOTE 1 26 CFR 54.9815-2713T(b)(1); 29 CFR 2590.715-2713(b)(1); 45 CFR 147.130(b)(1). END FOOTNOTE
On August 1, 2011, HRSA adopted and released guidelines for women's preventive services based on recommendations of the independent Institute of Medicine, which had undertaken a review of the scientific and medical evidence on women's preventive services (Women's Preventive Services: Required Health Plan Coverage Guidelines, or HRSA Guidelines). /2/ As relevant here, the HRSA Guidelines include all Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling for all women with reproductive capacity, as prescribed by a health care provider (collectively, contraceptive services). /3/ Accordingly, under section 2713 of the PHS Act and the 2010 interim final rules, non-grandfathered group health plans and health insurance issuers offering non-grandfathered group or individual health insurance coverage are required to provide coverage without cost sharing of women's preventive health services, including contraceptive services, consistent with the HRSA Guidelines in plan years (or, in the individual market, policy years) beginning on or after August 1, 2012, except as discussed later in this section.

FOOTNOTE 3 This excludes services relating to a man's reproductive capacity, such as vasectomies and condoms. END FOOTNOTE
