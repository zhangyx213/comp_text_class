AMERICAN EXPRESS has reached its limit with Tori Spelling.
The credit card company sued the reality TV regular in Los Angeles this month, claiming she owes $37,982 and has failed to make a payment in months.
The daughter of TV mogul Aaron Spelling reportedly inherited only $800,000 of her dad's $500 million fortune when he died in 2006. She and husband Dean McDermott said in 2013 they were too broke to afford a vasectomy after the birth of their fourth child.
In its lawsuit, Amex says Spelling (inset) failed to make a payment of $1,477 on Aug. 18. The company wants full payment of the balance and legal costs. Attempts to reach Spelling, 42, were not immediately successful Tuesday.
