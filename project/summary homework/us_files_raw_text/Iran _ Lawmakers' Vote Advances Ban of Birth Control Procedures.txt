Iran moved toward criminalizing vasectomies and tubal ligations on Tuesday as lawmakers approved a bill meant to counter a drop in the country's population, the semiofficial Iranian Students' News Agency reported. The measure, which would still require ratification by a constitutional watchdog, would imprison those convicted of performing vasectomies and tubal ligations for two to five years. Having successfully curbed birthrates for two decades, Iran is now promoting a baby boom to help make up for its graying population.
