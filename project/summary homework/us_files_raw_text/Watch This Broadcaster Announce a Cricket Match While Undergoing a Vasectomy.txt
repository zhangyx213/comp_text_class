Feb 01, 2017( Mediaite: / Delivered by Newstex)  When last we posted about cricket[1], we shared a video of a player getting hit in the family jewels. Once again, it seems, the only way the sport of cricket can get any love on this site is, unfortunately, by someone experiencing pain in the groin. This time, we call your attention to cricket commentator Mike Lane, who is not on the pitch, but rather, in the operating room. Lane broadcasted a match for the Alternative Commentary Collective straight from the operating roomjust as he was undergoing a vasectomy. 
[2] Lane looked really, really uncomfortable at certain points. But remarkably, he kept on broadcasting. Here's hoping that next time we feature the sport of cricket, we do so for a less painful reason. Watch above, via Facebook.
