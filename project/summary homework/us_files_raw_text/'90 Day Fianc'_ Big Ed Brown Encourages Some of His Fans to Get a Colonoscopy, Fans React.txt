 Big Ed[4] was dating Rose onBefore the 90 Days. They met on Facebook, and Ed was 54 at the time, and Rose was 23. He traveled to the Philippines, where she's from, and there were problems from the start, as well as complaints from Ed. Plus, he lied about his height. He even asked Rose to take an STD test, and he made comments about her shaving her legs and brushing her teeth. 

Despite all of that, Rose was still hopeful for a proposal, but things changed drastically when Big Ed revealed that he didn't want any more children. Rose wanted more kids, and Ed wanted to get a vasectomy. After that major issue, Rose broke up with Ed.  

Since that memorable appearance, Big Ed has been in a variety of spinoffs in the franchise, including 90 Day: The Single Life.

'What up my peeps?' Ed says. He goes on to say, 'Listen. When you're over 50, you gotta get the colon camera up your butt. And it's important because staying healthy is essential, for you and for the people around you. So, my dudes, if you're over 50 years old, get your colonoscopy when recommended. And, it can save your life. So, I'm all prepped. They put in my IV. It's kind of cool.' He also adds, 'But they're super nice. And I will see you guys on the other side. Have a great day. Love yourself, love yourself always. And yeah, you guys have a wonderful day. Take care.' 

Big Ed captioned the post on Instagram: 'Get the Colonoscopy once over 50 dudes..! #colonoscopy #biged #biged90dayfiance.' Over 83,000 people liked the post, and over 300 commented on it.
