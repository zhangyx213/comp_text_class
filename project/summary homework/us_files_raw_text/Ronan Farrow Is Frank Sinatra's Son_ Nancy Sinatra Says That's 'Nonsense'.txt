Back in 2013, Mia Farrow that Ronan Farrow -- her son long-believed to be fathered by her ex, Woody Allen -- was "possibly" the son of            . Although Farrow and Sinatra divorced in 1968, she admitted they maintained a relationship long after that (Ronan was born in 1987).

Now, Sinatra's undisputed biological children are weighing in on the subject. When asked about Ronan possibly being Frank's son on CBS Sunday Morning, responded, "Mia's son? Oh, nonsense." Nancy said Frank would have "laughed it off" if he were still alive. "I was kind of cranky at Mia for even saying 'possibly' because she knew better."
Similarly, Tina Sinatra recently spoke to and said it "couldn't be" true. "Frank had a vasectomy before that. I don't know whose son Ronan is."

Either way, Ronan Farrow seems intent on not following in either potential father's footsteps. He's avoided the worlds of music and film, focusing his attention on politics, journalism and activism (much like his mother, a longtime human-rights activist).
