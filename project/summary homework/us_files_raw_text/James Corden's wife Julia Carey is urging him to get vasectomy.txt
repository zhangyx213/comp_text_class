James Corden's wife is drawing the line at three children.
The 'Into The Woods' star - who has Max, six, Carey, three, and a third child, a little girl, with his wife Julia Carey - says that his spouse has been making "not very subtle hints" about a medical procedure he can have to stop the chance of them getting pregnant again.
He told The Sun newspaper: "My wife has started making not very subtle hints at medical procedures for me ... After the birth of my son, I felt it just couldn't get better. Then Carey came along, I have reached peak happiness, it can't go further."
Meanwhile, James previously admitted he feels "so lovely" after welcoming his third child.
He shared: "I just feel so lovely. It's such a wonderful thing to be a parent. You realise how indifferent you were before you had children. People used to show you a photo and you'd go, 'Yea, that's a kid.' Now I go, 'Oh my God, look at that!' ... It's so far beyond anything that we ever thought really. I also don't know if my wife and I would've gone for a third if we didn't live in California because you don't have any space in London. I feel so lucky that we have three healthy children. I just feel really blessed with all of it."
James really "can't bear being away" from his family.
The 39-year-old actor and television personality said: "I sort of can't bear being away from everybody. We just had a daughter and it feels a little soon to try and travel as a family. So unfortunately they will be in Los Angeles and I will be in New York. I think there will be a lot of FaceTiming before the show, with my wife saying, 'Breathe, shut up, get over yourself, it's not about you.' She's an incredible sort of calming presence for me."
