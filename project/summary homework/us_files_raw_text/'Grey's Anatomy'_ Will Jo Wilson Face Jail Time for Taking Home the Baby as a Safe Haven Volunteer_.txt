Fans are left wondering if she is going to keep the baby and if what she did is legal. Fans debate whether or not Jo is going to face trouble with the authorities for taking the baby  After the events of the mid-season finale wrapped up, fans have so many questions. They want to know if Jo and Alex are going to adopt this baby. Some viewers believe Jo is in danger of going to jail for taking the baby home.'Technically, she is kidnapping the child from the custody of the state of Washington when she deliberately failed to turn him into the receiving authority,' wroteone Instagram user[8]. She's going to be in big trouble if she doesn't hand him over immediately.'

Then there are a few viewers who believe she is still just doing her job as a Safe Haven volunteer.'[Jo] didn't kidnap the baby,' argued another fan. 'She spoke to Ben and the others at Station 19. They definitely knew. She was panicked because of the magnitude of what she took on, as in the job to care for a baby, and [Jo] didn't tell Karen about it before doing it, but she did nothing illegal.' What are the laws regarding the Safe Haven Program?  'In 1999, an overwhelming number of infant abandonments took place,' according toBaby Safe Haven[11]. 'Never before in a single year had so many mothers decided that they couldn't care for their children—and then disposed of their newborn infants in an unsafe and tragic way.''In response, a group of dedicated people worked together to create a law that would guarantee no mother ever had to secretly dispose of her newborn infant,' the website continues. 'This law would protect the mother and assure her that she would not be prosecuted for relinquishing her baby. So long as the baby was safe and given to a responsible adult at a designated location, the mother would be free to go anonymously.'There are laws in place to protect the mothers of the infants that leave their newborns at designated safe areas.'A hospital or fire station, its employees, volunteers, and medical staff are immune from any criminal or civil liability for accepting or receiving a newborn under this section,' according to theWashington Safe Haven Law[12].
