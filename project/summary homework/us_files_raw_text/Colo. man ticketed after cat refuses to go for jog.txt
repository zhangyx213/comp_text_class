Want pizza with that?
Get a vasectomy, eat some pizza and watch some basketball.
That's the idea behind a promotion by a Massachusetts urologists group that's offering a free pizza to vasectomy patients during March Madness.
An administrator with Urology Associates of Cape Cod said it's a lighthearted way to raise awareness about the procedure and drum up business.
Evan Cohen said that getting a vasectomy during the NCAA basketball tournament is the perfect time because typically a day or two of recovery is needed following the operation, so it gives patients an excuse to lie on the couch and watch hoops.
Dr. Evangelos Geraniotis, a urologist at the practice with offices in Hyannis, Sandwich and Nantucket, called a vasectomy an "easy and less stressful" form of birth control.

Cat refuses to go for jog
Police in Lafayette, Colo., have ticketed a man who is accused of tying his cat to a rock after the feline refused to go jogging.
Sgt. Fred Palmer said 19-year-old Seth Franco brought his cat on a leash to the path around Waneka Lake Park on Wednesday, but the cat was unable to keep up.
Witnesses told police that Franco secured the cat's leash to a rock while he finished his run. A passer-by called police.
Franco was ticketed on suspicion of "domestic animal cruel treatment," a municipal offense.
Palmer said an ordinance in the city, about 20 miles north of Denver, "prohibits that kind of tethering."
The cat wasn't injured, so it was released to its owner.
Franco could not immediately be reached for comment.
