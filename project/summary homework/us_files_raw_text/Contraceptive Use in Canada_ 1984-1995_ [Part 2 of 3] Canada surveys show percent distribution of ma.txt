Highlight: According to information on women in Canada during the years 1984-1995, tubal ligation was most popular form of contraception among married and cohabiting women [Part 2 of 3]
Body


In this section, we focus our attention on contraceptive users, examining which methods are used and whether the choice of method varies according to particular socioeconomic and demographic variables. To conserve space and avoid the problem of small cell sizes, we examine the five most popular methods (tubal ligation, vasectomy, oral contraceptives, condom and IUD) and combine all other methods (rhythm, diaphragm, foam and withdrawal) into one category. With few exceptions, observed differences in contraceptive use between social groups are statistically significant, based on chi-square tests.
Women in 1984--1995
* Demographic variations. In both survey years, rates of tubal ligation increased with women's age (Table 4). At almost every age, this method of contraception is more common among women than (their partner's) vasectomy. This was expected, as data on sterilization were retained only for the respondent's own sterilization procedure and not for his or her partner's. In both survey years, fewer than 3% of women had a tubal ligation by age 24. The percentage of women with a tubal ligation rose to more than 65% among women age 45 or older. Between 1984 and 1995, the rate of tubal ligation declined in all age-groups, particularly among women 30 or older, while the rate of vasectomy increased after age 30. Oral contraceptives were the preferred method among women younger than 30 in both surveys. Between 1984 and 1995, pill use increased for women aged 25-40, particularly those aged 30-34. Condom use also rose among women younger than 45. During this period, the use of the IUD declined among all women younger than age 45.
Tubal ligation was the most common contraceptive choice among married and cohabiting and previously married women in both surveys, while oral contraceptives were the preferred method of single women. For married and cohabiting women, the rate of tubal ligation declined from 39% to 31% between the two surveys, whereas the rate of (their partner's) vasectomy rose from 16% to 24%. For single women, pill use declined somewhat between 1984 and 1995, while condom use tripled.
As expected, the pill was the method most often used by childless women. Among women with two or more children, tubal ligation and (a partner's) vasectomy became predominant. A similar pattern was observed by desire for children: Women who desired additional children relied primarily on oral contraceptives, while those wanting no (or no more) children largely were protected from pregnancy by sterilization. Further, a decline in tubal ligation and an increase in (a partner's) vasectomy were observed among women of all parities except childless women. Condom use also increased for women at all parities.
* Socioeconomic variations. Tubal ligation and oral contraceptives were the main contraceptive methods used by women at all educational levels. Despite the overall decline in tubal ligation, reliance on this method actually increased among women with a high school education between 1984 and 1995. In both years, tubal ligation was the most popular method among women with an elementary education, while the pill remained most popular among those with some college or university education. Despite the overall increase in vasectomy, a decline was observed in levels of (a partner's) vasectomy among women of the lowest educational status. Pill use fell most notably among women with a high school education. Condom use increased at all educational levels, while IUD use declined at all levels.
Female sterilization and the pill also were the most popular methods among women at all income levels. Oral contraceptive use was most common among women with a lower income. While rates of tubal ligation did not vary according to income, a partner's vasectomy was more common among women with higher family income. Again, as with education, condom use increased but IUD use decreased in all income levels between 1984 and 1995. In 1984, reliance on other methods was highest among women with a higher education, while in 1995, use of other methods was highest among women with an elementary education and those with some college or university education.
* Cultural variations. Religious affiliation did not have much influence on contraceptive choice. While there was little difference in contraceptive preferences between Catholic and Protestant women in both years, there were some differences between these two affiliations and women of other religious faiths. Tubal ligation and oral contraceptives were the predominant contraceptive methods used by women of all religious faiths. Except among women of "other" religious affiliations, female sterilization declined in all religious groups between 1984 and 1995, while rates of a partner's vasectomy increased in all groups. Condom use also increased in all groups except those of other religious orientations, while IUD use declined in all groups.
The same two contraceptives were the main methods used by women at all levels of church attendance, but the incidence of tubal ligation appeared to be greater among those who attended religious services more regularly, while the reverse was true for pill use. Further, between 1984 and 1995, rates of tubal ligation declined and rates of partner's vasectomy increased at all levels of church attendance. While reliance on the pill remained stable, condom use increased and IUD use decreased among all groups. Those who attended church regularly were most likely to have had a tubal ligation, but were least likely to use oral contraceptives.
Immigrant women were less likely to use the pill than were Canadian-born women, but the reverse was true for the condom. A decrease in rates of tubal ligation and an increase in rates of vasectomy and condom use were observed in both groups. Finally, regional differences in contraceptive choices were generally small and nonsignificant in 1984.
Men in 1995
* Demographic variations. In contrast to the situation among women, condom use predominated until age 35 among men and peaked in the early 20s (Table 5). However, as with women, vasectomy and a partner's tubal ligation became more prevalent after the late 30s. Vasectomy was more common than tubal ligation, which is consistent with the reported rates of tubal ligation among women. As expected, partner's pill use was more prevalent among younger men than among older men.
The pattern of contraceptive choices according to marital status among men was comparable to that among women. Sterilization was less common among single men than among men of other marital status. Condom use predominated among single and previously married men, whereas reliance on the pill and sterilization was more common among married and cohabiting men. Among the previously married, only 36% of men were sterilized (compared with 63% of previously married women). Also, 86% of single men were condom users, while 65% of single women used oral contraceptives. This pattern of findings suggests that among single people who practice contraception, women are more concerned with fertility control, while men are more concerned with STD prevention.
Childless men were primarily condom users (71%), while 64% of childless women used the pill. Among men with one child, the proportion using condoms was reduced to 42%, while the proportion relying on sterilization increased to 24%. At higher parities, the corresponding figures were 16% and 69%, respectively. Moreover, men who desired more children were more likely to rely on condoms and (their partners') oral contraceptive use than were men who did not want any (or any additional) children.
* Socioeconomic variations. The effect of education was more evident in rates of tubal ligation than in rates of vasectomy. As was seen among women, the rate of partner's tubal ligation decreased as education increased, and condom use rose along with education. At all levels of education and at most levels of family income, the condom was the preferred method. However, condom use declined with rising income; this may reflect an aging effect, as family income generally rises with age, at least until partners reach middle age.[15] Further, rates of both tubal ligation and vasectomy generally increase as family income rises. Finally, while work status was not associated with contraceptive choice for women, the same cannot be said for men: Employed men tended to report higher rates of sterilization and partner's pill use, but a lower rate of condom use.
* Cultural variations. The effect of religion on contraceptive choice was similar for men and women. Sterilization was more common among Catholics and Protestants than among others. Condom use predominated among all religious groups, particularly among men of non-Christian background. Church attendance also had some influence on contraceptive use and method choice: The rate of vasectomy increased with church attendance, while the reverse was true for condom use. These findings were generally consistent with those reported for women.
There was little gender difference in the effect of immigration status. Vasectomy was less common among immigrants than among nonimmigrants, and the opposite was true for rates of condom use. There were few variations by immigrant status in rates of tubal ligation and pill use. Finally, differences between the Quebecois and the rest of Canadians in contraceptive choice were small and statistically nonsignificant.
