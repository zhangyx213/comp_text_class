The Montana House endorsed a bill Friday that would require health insurance companies to offer coverage plans that do not include elective abortions.
 Representatives voted 55-44 to endorse Senate Bill 349.
 The measure would require insurers offering plans that cover elective abortions to also offer at least one plan that doesn't. The bill doesn't include abortion coverage for cases such as incest, rape or when the life of the mother is at risk.
 "Many people in Montana do not want to participate in group policies that offer elective abortion," said Republican Rep. Vince Ricci.
 Democratic Rep. Ellie Hill of Missoula spoke against the measure, saying no insurance companies support the bill and no other conditions such as vasectomies are put on policies in this manner.
 "If you believe in less government and if you believe in individual privacy, you should vote no on this bill," she said.
