Minor surgeries will resume next month at the Veterans Affairs hospital in Southern Illinois where operations were stopped after a spike in post-surgical deaths.
After a review of the Marion VA Medical Center, Dr. Ralph DePalma, the VA's national director of surgery, recommended allowing certain surgeries. Minor outpatient procedures for low-risk patients will resume on May 8, officials said Tuesday.
Approved procedures include knee arthroscopies, prostate biopsies, vasectomies and hernia repairs.
"We will continue to do our best to rebuild the confidence and meet the high standards of care veterans, their families, and the community expect of us," said the center's acting director, Warren Hill, who added he is pleased with the progress the facility has made.
The VA halted all surgeries at the Marion center last August after it found at least nine deaths between October 2006 and March 2007 were "directly attributable" to substandard care. 
Of an additional 34 cases the VA investigated, 10 patients died after receiving questionable care that complicated their health, officials said. Investigators could not determine if the actual care caused those deaths.
Interim administrators have been in place since September, shortly after the site's director, chief of staff, chief of surgery and an anesthesiologist were moved to other positions or placed on leave. The anesthesiologist has since quit.
Last month, Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin expressed frustration that the Marion hospital still has no permanent leadership or surgical unit.
No timetable has been set for inpatient procedures.
