A vasectomy is typically uncomplicated and inexpensive. But it pays to be a methodical consumer-patient.
  FIND A DOCTOR ON YOUR PLAN. Even if the doctor takes your insurance, ask in advance, ''What will my share of the cost be?'' 
  Some doctor's offices will call your insurer and determine your out-of-pocket costs. If the doctor can't or won't do that, then ask your insurance company if vasectomies are covered and to what extent. 
  YOU'RE PAYING? NEGOTIATE. If the procedure will not be covered because you have not met your insurance policy's annual deductible, or you do not have insurance, explain your situation to your doctor and ask ''What is your best rate?'' suggests Dr. Charles L. Wilson, founder of the Vasectomy Clinic, in Seattle.  
  BEWARE THAT PRICES VARY. Well-known specialists may charge as much as $3,000, while some Planned Parenthood clinics do vasectomies for $350 to $500. To find a local Planned Parenthood clinic, go to plannedparenthood.org, type in your ZIP code and look for a center that lists men's health services. LESLEY ALDERMAN
