Big Ed and Rose Vega of 90 Day Fianc | thisisbiged via Instagram; rose_vega_official via InstagramWhat happened with Big Ed and Rose? Brown and Vega's relationship caused problems from the moment it began. Brown's daughter refused to speak to him once he began dating Vega due to the age difference and fact that she didn't believe Vega's feelings were genuine. Brown lied about a lot of things before meeting Vega, including his height and appearance.Once he got to the Philipines, Brown was immediately inconsiderate of Vega. He asked her to get an STD test to prove that she was 'clean.' He also requested that she shave her legs. Later on in his trip, he told Vega that her breath stank and bought her a toothbrush and mouthwash.Vega endured all of Brown's criticism. She didn't even really argue with him at all until he admitted that he was planning on getting a vasectomy.'I should have been more truthful,' he told her. 'I apologize. I should've said I don't want more kids, but I wanted to get to know ou. I wanted [you] to get to know me to make sure we are compatible.'

I think,' she said to him. 'First [you] lied to me about [your] height. Right? Then, you want to give me an STD test right? Andabout mouthwash, why you tell me? You know I [am] sick, I have [an] ulcer. I'm disappointed because you always embarrassed me. I think [you] don't love me. I'm done.' What do Rose and Ed find funny? When viewers were first introduced to Brown, he said that he had to do a few odd things to keep up his appearance. In order to look young for Vega, Brown would dye his hair black. The dye would make his hair itchy so he would lather his tresses with mayonnaise to help with the dryness and make his hair soft.While  appearing on the new show B90 Strikes Back! Brown discussed his infamous mayonnaise scene.'I've never gotten more sh*t in my life for anything I've ever done in my life than the mayo scene,' Brown said. 'My biggest fear after watching this scene is that my face will be on a jar of mayo. Oh god.'During the mayonnaise scene, Brown donned a blue kimono.
