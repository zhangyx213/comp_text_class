January 15, 1950: Mora Roaring flames and flying embers driven by a 40-mile-an-hour wind Saturday threatened the town of Mora. Volunteer firemen summoned fire fighters from Las Vegas, and they succeeded in putting out the blaze.
The fire began in Walter's garbage and spread to a nearby lumber pile which burned fiercely. The wind began to scatter embers, threatening the entire business section. It was then the call for help was made.
Archbishop Edwin V. Byrne said Saturday that the number of liquor establishments in Santa Fe is enough to give the city 'cause to be ashamed.'
January 15, 1975: An agreement last summer to sell the sprawling J.W. Eaves Ranch south of Santa Fe to a land holding firm has fallen through, parties to the deal acknowledged today. The ranch, known as an established movie production site, covers 1,600 acres about 19 miles south of Santa Fe near the main road to Cerrillos. Presently there are four movie sets on it.
Until New Mexico welfare officials design an administrative procedure which meets federal requirements, the Health and Social Services Department will not approve payment of voluntary sterilizations for welfare clients. New federal rules require that persons on welfare who request sterilization be informed to the last detail what the operation involves. There is also a possibility that the age at which persons on welfare can be sterilized will be raised in New Mexico from 18 to 21. For men, sterilization is carried out through a vasectomy; for women, the operation is a tubal ligation.
