 07 Aug 2023 (Philippines News Agency) The Commission on Population and Development (CPD) is calling for more medical doctors in Northern Mindanao to specialize in non-scalpel vasectomy.
Fe Sumagpao, family planning program manager of the CPD-Northern Mindanao (CPD-10) said on Monday they need doctors in different provinces and local government units (LGUs) to undergo specialized training for vasectomy inclusion in their program "because there are still few who specialize in it here (in the region)."
Currently, CPD-10 only has one doctor specializing in non-scalpel vasectomy working at the J.R. Borja General Hospital, a city-government-run facility.
Neil Aldrin Omega, CPD-10 director, said clients for vasectomy from different provinces will be provided with transportation through coordination with the agency's satellite and provincial offices.
"We have to admit that acceptance of men undergoing vasectomy is still a challenge, in the previous months, we only have two, but we are consistent with our call on this (family planning) method," he said.
Omega said if more doctors in the region train and become accredited to perform a vasectomy, it will help in reducing travel time, as well as expand the promotion of the family planning method.
CPD is observing Family Planning Month every August of the year, together with other health-related observances including National Lung Month and National Breastfeeding Month which is led by the Department of Health.
