I congratulate the Supreme Court under Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno for seemingly upholding, 11-4, the non-unconstitutionality of the Reproductive Health Law (Republic Act 8344) even while burning the bedrock foundation of what should have been the sole legacy of President BS Aquino's six-year presidency-an aggressive population control program. 
On April 10, the high court declared the RH Law and its implementing rules and regulations "not unconstitutional", meaning they are basically constitutional as it is the right of government to adopt reproductive health measures as long as they are not coercive. 
But the high court, voting overwhelmingly against (either 10-5 or 11-4), emasculated the law by declaring as unconstitutional eight major provisions that would have made a government-mandated and sponsored family planning program effective and mandatory with penalties or sanctions against the violators or objectors. 
How can the government now ensure compliance with the RH Law and its implementing rules and regulations (IRR) when it cannot force hospitals run by religious groups or any group for that matter, to refer family planning patients to another health facility; when it cannot punish a health worker, whether private or government employed, who refuses to disseminate family planning materials by invoking their religious beliefs; when it cannot require a spouse from using contraceptives or vasectomy or tubal ligation without the consent of the other spouse; when it cannot secure for patients free reproductive health service if the health worker invokes religious beliefs or conscientious objection; and when minors cannot obtain birth control drugs or services without the consent of a parent or a guardian? 
Because the eight provisions have been declared unconstitutional, the battle on the RH Law in effect is a defeat for President BS Aquino.  
Aquino had deployed the full panoply of presidential power in an attempt to bludgeon the Supreme Court into submission and for it to uphold the constitutionality of the law, including the eight provisions declared unconstitutional.  To its credit, the court held its ground on the basic constitutional issues in the RH Law, namely: 
The right to life (of the unborn); the right to health (contraceptives could be hazardous to one's health); freedom of religion (public funds are used to procure contraceptives); and the family (the right of spouses to found a family "is shared by both spouses";).  These are bedrock universal constitutional principles and are difficult to subvert.
