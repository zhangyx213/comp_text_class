Apr 07, 2015( ReleaseWire: / Delivered by Newstex) <nl/> Laguna Hills, CA -- (ReleaseWire) -- 04/07/2015 -- Dr. Aaron Spitz[1] is a renowned fertility physician in Orange County, California, as well as a partner at Orange County Urology Associates. He also leads Vasectomy Reversal USA, the male fertility division of Orange County Urology Associates. Recently, Dr. Spitz was featured on the popular CBS television program, "The Doctors," where he performed a live no-needle, no-scalpel vasectomy in order to educate America on how easy and minimally invasive this form of contraception can be. 
This procedure will air the last week of April during "sweeps weeks." <nl/><nl/>Dr. Aaron Spitz is widely known for vasectomies and vasectomy reversals in San Diego[2] and the surrounding regions. People come to Dr. Spitz nationwide for minimally-invasive vasectomies with nominal pain. Dr. Aaron Spitz explains that a needle is no longer used to deliver anesthetics to the vas deferens. He tells the audience on The Doctors, "We've eliminated the fear and pain of the needle in order to numb the area," while displaying the new air-jet device used to "shoot" the anesthetic into the vas deferens without a needle. <nl/><nl/>Dr. Spitz also educates viewers in his past videos, telling them that the incision used to perform the procedure is extremely small. He notes that, "The opening is so small…it's just a few millimeters, and in many cases it doesn't require a suture to close it." Typically, patients of Dr. Spitz are in and out of the office in under an hour. Dr. Spitz may lessen the anxiety by sharing some humor with his patients, which clearly comes through in his past live vasectomy videos, featured on Vasectomy Reversal USA's website as well as their YouTube.com channel. <nl/><nl/>Throughout the year, Dr. Aaron Spitz[3] provides a wide variety of fertility consultation, ranging from consultation and diagnosis, to full, comprehensive treatment of disorders affecting individuals and couples nationwide. He has performed some of San Diego's most successful vasectomy reversals. Dr. Spitz coordinates care with top in-vitro fertility specialists for those couples who require or desire IVF.
