ABSTRACT
Background
Medically assisted reproduction (MAR) is a challenging application area for health economic evaluations, entailing a broad range of costs and outcomes, stretching out long-term and accruing to several parties.
Purpose
To systematically review which costs and outcomes are included in published economic evaluations of MAR and to compare these with health technology assessment (HTA) prescriptions about which cost and outcomes should be considered for different evaluation objectives.
Data Sources
HTA guidelines and systematic searches of PubMed Central, Embase, WOS CC, CINAHL, Cochrane (CENTRAL), HTA, and NHS EED.
Study Selection
All economic evaluations of MAR published from 2010 to 2022.
Data Extraction
A predetermined data collection form summarized study characteristics. Essential costs and outcomes of MAR were listed based on HTA and treatment guidelines for different evaluation objectives. For each study, included costs and outcomes were reviewed.
Data Synthesis
The review identified 93 cost-effectiveness estimates, of which 57% were expressed as cost-per-(healthy)-live-birth, 19% as cost-per-pregnancy, and 47% adopted a clinic perspective. Few adopted societal perspectives and only 2% used quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Broader evaluations omitted various relevant costs and outcomes related to MAR. There are several cost and outcome categories for which available HTA guidelines do not provide conclusive directions regarding inclusion or exclusion.
Limitations
Studies published before 2010 and of interventions not clearly labeled as MAR were excluded. We focus on methods rather than which MAR treatments are cost-effective.
Conclusions
Economic evaluations of MAR typically calculate a short-term cost-per-live-birth from a clinic perspective. Broader analyses, using cost-per-QALY or BCRs from societal perspectives, considering the full scope of reproduction-related costs and outcomes, are scarce and often incomplete. We provide a summary of costs and outcomes for future research guidance and identify areas requiring HTA methodological development.
Highlights
The cost-effectiveness of MAR procedures can be exceptionally complex to estimate as there is a broad range of costs and outcomes involved, in principle stretching out over multiple generations and over many stakeholders.
We list 21 key areas of costs and outcomes of MAR. Which of these needs to be accounted for alters for different evaluation objectives (determined by the type of economic evaluation, time horizon considered, and perspective).
Published studies mostly investigate cost-effectiveness in the very short-term, from a clinic perspective, expressed as cost-per-live-birth. There is a lack of comprehensive economic evaluations that adopt a broader perspective with a longer time horizon. The broader the evaluation objective, the more relevant costs and outcomes were excluded.
For several costs and outcomes, particularly those relevant for broader, societal evaluations of MAR, the inclusion or exclusion is theoretically ambiguous, and HTA guidelines do not offer sufficient guidance.
FULL TEXT
About 1 in 6 couples experience problems of sub- or infertility, that is, they are unable to conceive pregnancy after 1 y of regular, unprotected sexual intercourse.1 A wide range of effective, but often costly, medically assisted reproduction (MAR) treatments is available to help these couples in realizing their child wish. This includes reproductive surgery, artificial insemination, and assisted reproductive technology (ART; e.g., in vitro fertilization [IVF]).2,3 Globally, all MAR treatments are increasingly being used, with ART being the most frequently performed procedure.4 Today, for ART alone, about 2.6 million cycles are performed each year, worldwide, resulting in an estimated 500,000 “test tube babies” being born each year.4,5 Since the birth of Louise Brown, the first IVF baby born in 1978, more than 10 million children globally have been born after ART treatment.5–7
Countries widely diverge in their reimbursement policy for MAR. Countries with generous public funding policies such as Belgium, Italy, Japan, and Croatia (partly) reimburse up to 6 consecutive ART cycles and Israel even an unlimited number of cycles, whereas other countries refer all ART to private insurance or private funding, such as Switzerland and Ireland.8,9 In all of these countries, budget pressures force decision makers to set funding priorities across health care interventions. Evidence of cost-effectiveness increasingly becomes a standard (and at times even a legally required) input for reimbursement decisions.10
However, the concept of cost-effectiveness is more layered and complex in the context of MAR than in most other health care areas,11–14 because of the particular nature of infertility, the multiple generations involved, and the broad range of costs and outcomes that are potentially relevant. Several researchers have highlighted the difficulties with applying standard health technology assessment (HTA) approaches to MAR.11,13–18 For instance, the ESHRE Capri Workshop group on the economic aspects of infertility care concluded that performing economic analyses of MAR is difficult as these treatments “pose a number of unique challenges.”15 The group concluded that “if management of infertility is to become an integral part of publicly or privately funded health care systems worldwide, better quality data and a shared vision about the costs and benefits of infertility treatments are needed.”19
The objective of this study is to present an overview of how researchers have approached the cost-effectiveness of MAR and which costs and outcomes they deemed relevant to include in their study. We categorize costs and outcomes associated with MAR and use HTA guidelines to disentangle which costs and outcomes should (theoretically) be considered for different evaluation objectives to estimate its cost-effectiveness. We then use this table to systematically review all economic evaluations of MAR published since 2010. We conclude with suggestions for improving the quality of further studies, and we point at the need for further conceptual research regarding the ambiguous status of certain costs and outcomes.
Methods
Overview of Costs and Outcomes Related to MAR
We used handbooks in reproductive health care20–22 as well as expert opinion (from 1 of the authors [T.D.]) to summarize the most relevant types of costs and outcomes to be considered in the MAR pathway (see Table 1).

ADHD, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder; ART, assisted reproductive technology; FSH, follicle stimulating hormone; IUI, intrauterine insemination; LH, luteinizing hormone; MAR, medically assisted reproduction; PCOS, polycystic ovary syndrome; QoL, quality-of-life; SHBG, sex hormone binding globulin.
In terms of costs associated with MAR, directly or indirectly, we first identified the costs of MAR treatment itself (laboratory work, consultations, test tubes, cryopreservation, hormone treatments, etc.) including the costs of making an infertility diagnosis, given that a correct diagnosis is often crucial to choose the appropriate MAR treatment,24–27 as well as non–health care–related out-of-pocket payments incurred by patients themselves (e.g., transport costs). Next, there can be costs of (treating) complications due to MAR treatment (e.g., ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome).28 In case of successful MAR treatment leading to pregnancy, there are the costs of pregnancy and prenatal care, including costs of obstetric and perinatal complications.29 Similarly, there are costs of delivery (costs of normal and complicated childbirth, cesarean sections, etc.) and postnatal follow-up care (costs of postpartum, neonatal and postnatal care),30 all originating from the MAR treatment. In addition, at all stages, there are productivity losses that need to be accounted for—at least from societal perspectives—because of absenteeism and presenteeism during treatment, pregnancy, delivery, and so forth. Much further downstream, but important to understand the long-term societal value of MAR, there are also various broader social impacts of raising a child: related to basic and complicated childcare, related to health care and education, and so on. Of course, these societal “costs” can become “gains,” for instance, when a new community member enters the labor force and takes up various roles in society (e.g., becoming a tax payer).
All of these can, in principle, be relevant costs, as they can be caused by MAR treatment and hence differ between intervention and comparator groups. This is evident in a comparison of a MAR treatment with a “no treatment” scenario. But, as MAR treatments differ in terms of their effectiveness rate and their risk of various complications, they can also be incremental in a comparison between 2 or more MAR treatments.
In terms of outcomes, as indicated by the “core outcome set for infertility,”31 relevant outcomes of MAR treatment to consider are viable intrauterine pregnancy confirmed by ultrasound (accounting for singleton, twin, and higher multiple pregnancy), pregnancy loss (accounting for ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage, stillbirth, and termination of pregnancy), live birth, gestational age at delivery, birth weight, neonatal mortality, and major congenital anomaly. However, for economic evaluations, pregnancy and (healthy) live birth are the main objectives and are therefore key effectiveness measures.13 But a pregnancy or a live birth says little about the many health and well-being outcomes that are associated with that event, to parents and the future child itself. For instance, some MAR treatments have a higher risk of producing multiple pregnancies than others (e.g., ART treatment compared with intrauterine insemination treatment if more than 1 embryo is transferred per cycle32). Multiple pregnancies imply a higher risk of preterm birth, which is associated with higher risks of fetal and neonatal oxygen deprivation, bleeding, infections, developmental problems, learning disabilities, impaired stimulus processing, and risk of symptoms of ADHD and autism.33–36 To fully understand the cost-effectiveness of MAR, and to correctly understand differences between competing MAR treatments, these outcomes should be properly considered.
In terms of health and well-being of parents (or even grandparents), a focus on live births only would ignore immediate quality-of-life (QoL) impacts (e.g., waiting times or the burden of treatment37) as well as longer-term impacts related to infertility when access to MAR treatment is not available or when MAR treatment was unsuccessful. Studies show that being (involuntarily) childless can have an impact on many aspects of physical and mental health and well-being,38,39 including depression, relational tension, distress, anxiety, and social isolation,40–43 although it is not always clear whether the relationship is causal or merely an association. These outcomes can also be (in)directly associated with an increased risk of physical health problems in the longer term (e.g., cardiovascular disease, cancer, or diabetes).38,44–47 On the other hand, studies also show that having children itself can negatively affect the health and well-being of adults, for instance, through postpartum depression, distress due to living with minor children, complexities of finding a good work-parenting balance, and the so-called “empty nest syndrome” when children become independent.48 There is no consensus in the literature regarding whether having children leads to better, worse, or similar health and well-being, all things considered.49–52
Determining the Relevance of Costs and Outcomes for Different Evaluation Objectives
Which consequences to consider in an economic evaluation depends on the study objective and the information it aims to provide for whom. We distinguish between studies that calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) expressed as cost-per-treatment-cycle, cost-per-pregnancy, cost-per-(healthy)-live-birth, cost-per-QALY, and benefit-cost ratio (BCR) as outcome measures, adopting a clinic (C), health care payer (H), patient (P), or societal (S) perspective.53 All of these approaches provide different insights. More narrow analyses calculated from a specific perspective (e.g., a cost-per-live-birth analysis from a clinic perspective) are important to assess competing interventions within a clinic’s MAR supply, while broader analyses from a wider perspective (e.g., cost-per-QALY analyses from a societal perspective) are more informative regarding determining budgets sizes and allocating resources to MAR.
We used standard HTA handbooks, guidelines, and articles13,54–59 to determine the dominant view regarding which costs and outcomes are relevant to consider for each study objective (see Figure 1). Green checkmarks indicate which costs and outcomes should be included, while red crosses indicate those that should be excluded. For example, a cost-per-(healthy)-live-birth from a clinic perspective focuses on costs incurred by the clinic but excludes productivity losses and outcomes on the parents’ health and well-being.

MAR, medically assisted reproduction; C, clinic perspective; H, health care payer perspective; P, patient perspective; S, societal perspective; QoL, quality-of-life; QALY: quality-adjusted life-year. aThe outcome health child short-term is relevant only when the outcome measure is expressed as cost-per-(healthy)-live-birth given that it also considers the health of the child.
Note, however, that some costs and outcomes have an ambiguous status (indicated by orange check marks in Figure 1). For these, HTA guidelines are ambiguous whether the rule is to include or exclude them. For instance, it remains unclear whether costs and QALYs of a newborn must be considered in a cost-per-QALY analysis.11,12,14,18,60,61 Also, although guidelines advise that, in principle, strictly equal lengths of accounting for costs and outcomes must be used,54 it remains unclear whether cost-per-pregnancy requires a time horizon up to the moment of pregnancy, excluding all events after the beginning of pregnancy (i.e., costs and QoL effects related to the pregnancy itself, delivery, childbirth, etc.). Likewise, it is unclear whether costs related to childbirth should be considered in cost-per-(healthy)-live-birth.
Systematic Review
To investigate how MAR treatments are evaluated and which costs and outcomes are accounted for in these analyses, we performed a systematic review of economic evaluations of MAR published from 2010 to 2022, building on another systematic review.62
The study protocol (Prospero registered: CRD42021249068) was developed a priori and followed throughout the review, as well as the PRISMA guidelines (see PRISMA checklist in Appendix A).63 A systematic search was conducted in PubMed Central, Embase, Web of Science CC, CINAHL, Cochrane (CENTRAL), HTA, and NHS EED in May 2022. Search terms included words related to 1) economic evaluation, HTA, cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), cost-minimization analysis (CMA), cost-utility analysis (CUA), and cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and 2) the most common types of MAR treatment (see Appendix B for detailed search strategies). The PICO framework was used to identify the terms to be used to select and assess studies by identifying valid questions based on the PICO concepts.64 Included studies were full economic evaluations (CUA, CBA, CEA, and CMA) and cost analyses. The search was restricted to English language and studies published from 2010 onward. Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, effectiveness studies, evaluations of prefertility diagnostics or treatments, conference abstracts, or posters were excluded.
Studies were examined against the prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria in 3 stages: 1) title screening, 2) abstract screening, and 3) full-text screening. EndNote X9 Software and Rayyan Systems Inc were used to organize the search results from the 7 databases and to remove duplicates. Two reviewers (A.V. and J.L.) independently selected relevant documents and then combined their selections. Disagreements were resolved through discussion. A predetermined data collection form summarized the main characteristics of the studies (see Supplementary Table I).
Analysis of Studies
The outcome measure of interest in each study was the ICER or BCR, both summary measures representing the cost-effectiveness of 1 intervention compared with an alternative.54 One study with a cost-per-life-year outcome was categorized under cost-per-(healthy)-live-birth, due to its calculation based on cost-per-live-birth and life expectancy. The outcome measures of CMA and cost-saving studies were classified under one of the CEA outcome measures. The time horizon of the study was determined by the maximal length over which costs and outcomes were counted. We compared which costs and outcomes were considered in the calculation of each outcome measure to the guideline prescriptions as summarized in Figure 1. If a cost or outcome was missing from the analysis while guidelines suggest that it should be included, we searched a provided justification for the exclusion in the text (e.g., because it was a negligibly small or a larger but similar in the treatment and comparison group).
Results
Study Characteristics
We identified 76 articles for further analysis (see Appendix C for reasons for excluding full-text articles). From these, 93 ICERs or BCRs were extracted (17 articles reported more than 1 outcome; Figure 2).
Figure 2
PRISMA flow diagram of selected studies in the systematic review.
Table 2 summarizes the main characteristics of the 93 included ICERs or BCRs. Most were performed alongside a clinical trial (70%, n = 66/93) in Western Europe (45%, n = 41/93), adopted a clinic perspective (47%, n = 44/93), and compared 2 variants of IVF (73%, n = 68/93). Most results were reported as cost-per-(healthy)-live-birth (57%, n = 53/93) or as cost-per-pregnancy (19%, n = 18/93). A minority of studies reflected a societal perspective (24%, n = 22/93), and very few calculated a cost-per-QALY (2%, n = 3/93) or BCR (7%, n = 6/93). The chosen time horizon varied substantially. Most ICERs and BCRs adopted a very short time horizon of 1 treatment cycle (29%, n = 27/93), 3 treatment cycles (11%, n = 10/93), or 1 y of follow-up (9%, n = 8/93). Only 1 ICER65 (1%, n = 1/93) expressed cost-effectiveness over a lifetime of a child born through MAR, while 62 ICERs or BCRs (67%, n = 62/93) did not look further than 1 y after the start of the treatment (considering that 1 treatment cycle lasts approximately 1 mo). For 7 ICERs or BCRs (8%, n = 7/93), the time horizon was unclear and could not be inferred from the context. In addition, the adopted time horizon was generally the same for costs and outcomes; however, in the calculation of 2 ICERs66,67 (2%, n = 2/93; both calculated from a clinic perspective and expressed cost-per-live-birth), costs were counted considerably longer (18 and 20 y) than outcomes (<5 y).

Table 3 presents a summary of the included studies’ performance in terms of including relevant costs and outcomes, based on Figure 1 (see Appendix D for the results per study). Five studies calculated cost-per-treatment-cycle, of which 3 (60%, n = 3/5) were from a clinic, 1 (20%, n = 1/5) from a patient, and 1 (20%, n = 1/5) from a societal perspective. Eighteen studies calculated cost-per-pregnancy, of which 1 (6%, n = 1/18) was from a health care payer, 9 (50%, n = 9/18) from a clinic, 3 (17%, n = 3/18) from a patient, and 5 (28%, n = 5/18) from a societal perspective. Sixty studies (97%, n = 60/62) calculated cost-per-live-birth, and 230,108 (3%, n = 2/62) calculated cost-per-healthy-live-birth, considering the health of the newborn child and in which an unhealthy live birth is not counted as an outcome.141 Of these, 11 (18%, n = 11/62) represented the perspective from the health care payer, 32 (52%, n = 32/62) from the clinic, 10 (16%, n = 10/62) from the patient, and 9 (15%, n = 9/62) from society. One cost-per-QALY was calculated from a patient and 1 from a societal perspective, whereas the 6 available BCRs were all calculated from the perspective of society.

Two outcome measures from a clinic perspective were expressed as cost-per-(healthy)-live-birth,30,108 making this outcome category relevant for only 2 ICERs.
Costs Considered
Costs related to the infertility diagnosis were not included in any cost-per-treatment-cycle, cost-per-QALY, or BCR calculations. They were only limitedly included in cost-per-pregnancy analyses from a clinic72 (11%, n = 1/9) and a societal83 (20%, n = 1/5) perspective, as is the case with cost-per-(healthy)-live-birth analyses from a clinic (13%, n = 4/32), health care payer115 (9%, n = 1/11), and patient87 (10%, n = 1/10) perspective. Costs related to MAR treatment itself were always included. Pregnancy costs were mostly represented in cost-per-pregnancy (H: 100% [n = 1/1]79; C: 56% [n = 5/9]; P: 67% [n = 2/3]77,81; S: 40% [n = 2/5]79,85) and cost-per-(healthy)-live-birth (H: 46% [n = 5/11]; C: 50% [n = 16/32]; P: 40% [n = 4/10]; S: 56% [n = 5/9]) ICERs. Only the cost-per-QALY from a societal perspective66 included these costs, whereas the BCRs included these costs in 67% (n = 4/6) of the cases. Delivery costs were represented in cost-per-pregnancy (H: 100% [n = 1/1]79; S: 20% [n = 1/5]79) and cost-per-(healthy)-live-birth (H: 46% [n = 5/11]; C: 50% [n = 16/32]; P: 30% [n = 3/10]; S: 56% [n = 5/9]). Only the cost-per-QALY calculation performed from a societal perspective66 included these costs, whereas the BCRs included these costs in 67% (n = 4/6) of the cases. Postnatal follow-up care costs were represented in 1 cost-per-pregnancy calculated from the clinic perspective73 (11%, n = 1/9). Cost-per-(healthy)-live-birth included these costs in 36% (n = 4/11) of the cases from a health care payer, 28% (n = 9/32) of the cases from a clinic, 10% (n = 1/10) of the cases from a patient,108 and 11% (n = 1/9) of the cases from a societal43 perspective. Only the cost-per-QALY analyses performed from a societal perspective66 included these costs, whereas the BCRs included these costs in 33% (n = 2/6) of the cases.136,139 All these cost categories were usually based on charges by country-dependent health institutions. Basic and complicated childcare costs were included in cost-per-(healthy)-live-birth analyses from a health care payer116 (9%, n = 1/11), clinic67 (3%, n = 1/32), patient125 (10%, n = 1/10), and societal65 (11%, n = 1/9) perspective and the cost-per-QALY analysis calculated from a societal perspective66 (100%, n = 1/1). These costs are typically calculated by taking annual costs for singletons and twins and then applying annual health and social care costs based on the long-term health outcomes of children. Costs related to care for involuntary childlessness were never accounted for, although it remains open for debate whether such costs are causally related to failed reproduction. Productivity losses due to treatment were included by the cost-per-treatment-cycle calculation from a societal71 and by cost-per-pregnancy calculations in 20% (n = 1/5) of the cases from a societal perspective.84 Cost-per-(healthy)-live-birth included these costs in 44% (n = 4/9) of the cases from a societal perspective. Even though indicated as irrelevant for these perspectives, these costs were also included in 33% (n = 1/3) of the cost-per-pregnancy calculations from a patient perspective, in 27% (n = 3/11) of the cost-per-(healthy)-live-birth calculations from a health care payer, in 3% (n = 1/32) of the cases from a clinic88 and in 10% (n = 1/10) of the cases from a patient perspective.126 They were also included in 50% (n = 3/6) of the BCRs but not included in cost-per-QALY analyses. Productivity losses due to pregnancy and childcare were included in 1 cost-per-(healthy)-live-birth analysis from a clinic perspective88 (3%, n = 1/32). The productivity losses were routinely monetized based on average wage and absence from work. Broader long-term social impacts were included by 1 cost-per-(healthy)-live-birth analysis from the societal perspective65 (11%, n = 1/9). Calculations were based on the average expense paid (e.g., education) or received (through taxes) by the government per individual in society. Non–health care–related out-of-pocket payments were never accounted for in cost-per-treatment-cycle, cost-per-pregnancy or cost-per-QALY analyses. Cost-per-(healthy)-live-birth analyses included these costs in 27% (n = 3/11) of the cases from a health care payer, 10% (n = 1/10) of the cases from a patient,126 and 22% (n = 2/9) of the cases from a societal perspective.86,133 BCRs included these in 17% (n = 1/6) of the cases.136 These costs were, for example, calculated based on questionnaires that probed travel distance and mode of transportation to the hospital for patients.
Outcomes Considered
All cost-per-treatment-cycle, cost-per-pregnancy, and cost-per-(healthy)-live-birth analyses disregarded, by default, the further health and well-being of the child after its birth, in the short or long-term (except for 2 cost-per-healthy-live-birth analyses30,108 that considered the health of the child in the short-term). The health of the parents in the short-term was accounted for in all cost-per-QALY analyses and all BCR calculations. The impact on their health in the long-term was only accounted for by the cost-per-QALY study from the societal perspective66 through considering the time spent by women in different states (such as premature delivery/neonatal admission, giving birth to a child with disability, experiencing a neonatal death, no subsequent pregnancy and treatment failure, lifelong childlessness), described using utility weights, which enabled the estimation of women’s QALYs.66 Outcomes in 4 of the 6 BCRs (67%, n = 4/6) were measured as the willingness to pay (WTP) for a future child by either wish parents (reflecting the parental desire to have children) or society (reflecting the general public’s valuation of having a new society member as well as helping aspiring parents with their child wish). This WTP is then multiplied by the number of observed live births in a study and consequently compared with the total costs. The other 2 BCRs136,137 used a method by Briggs et al.,142 multiplying the cumulative live birth rates by a monetary value between €1 and €100,000 and deducting the total costs of the treatment policy. Note that while some of the consequences of MAR may not be explicitly monetized, they may be built into the WTP. In the cost-per-live-birth analyses, for instance, the WTP for a live birth might already account for some of the broader costs and outcomes of MAR.
Discussion
The objective of this review was to provide an overview of how studies evaluated the cost-effectiveness of MAR and to which extent they were complete in terms of the included costs and outcomes. Our review showed that the cost-effectiveness of MAR is predominantly calculated from a narrow, short-term perspective, focusing on direct intervention costs and counting pregnancies or live births, while excluding many of the pertinent broader costs and outcomes related to fertility and MAR treatments. The most used perspective was that of the clinic, focusing on the costs and outcomes of MAR treatments provided by the fertility clinic, including costs of equipment, personnel, and generating pregnancies or live births. This perspective is pragmatic and provides useful insights into the cost-effectiveness of individual treatments and helps fertility clinics or patients to make informed decisions about which treatments to offer or undergo. However, to answer key questions about the broader value for money of MAR, how to set limits to funding, and how to decide the appropriate budget size of MAR relative to other health care or public funding domains, analyses are needed that use a broader perspective and a longer time horizon.
In terms of quality of available studies in our systematic review, focusing on the costs and outcomes where guidelines are clear regarding inclusion or exclusion, the many narrowly defined cost-effectiveness studies did include most of the costs and outcomes deemed relevant. However, we recommend sensitivity analyses to clarify the impact of including the more ambiguous costs or outcomes. The choice of comparator and the consideration of societal impacts are also essential for providing the most relevant information to decision makers. The limited studies available that investigated broader, more long-term perspectives ignored many broader long-term costs and outcomes. For instance, costs of postnatal follow-up care, childcare, and outcomes on health and well-being of parents were routinely ignored. These costs can be substantial as they can potentially stretch out over a lifetime, can differ between treatment and intervention groups, and are therefore likely to influence cost-effectiveness conclusions. Guidelines on performing economic evaluations of health care interventions are clear in their prescription that all relevant costs and outcomes linked to the intervention should be included,54,55 at least in sensitivity analyses. For example, in their guidelines for economic evaluation, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) states that studies should “reflect all important differences in costs or outcomes between the technologies being compared.”143 On the other hand, a more complete study in terms of considered costs and outcomes can be based on less reliable data sources. Accurately estimating and valuing some of the costs and outcomes is challenging, as sound empirical evidence is lacking for some. For others, cost estimates may only be associated while evidence of causality is lacking (for example, the long-term health outcomes of parents or effects of being involuntary childless). Therefore, there may be a tradeoff between completeness and reliability of the economic evaluation when choosing between performing a broader, longer-term analysis or a narrower one with reliable estimates but neglecting potentially important information for the value for money of MAR. Opting for reliability over completeness may be justified; however, in that case, researchers should be conscious that their cost-effectiveness estimate may not represent “the bigger picture.” Our Figure 1 can stimulate reflection about potentially neglected cost and outcome areas. Future research can use it to increase the practicality of performing economic evaluations of MAR (e.g., discounting of longer-term costs and outcomes).
As indicated in Figure 1, there are several gray areas regarding which costs and outcomes must be included in economic evaluations of MAR where existing frameworks lack conclusive answers. These areas point at the need for further conceptual or methodological research to provide a conclusive answer about their inclusion. First, it is unclear for analyses performed from a clinic perspective whether only costs related to diagnosis and MAR treatment itself should be accounted for or whether fertility clinics also provide care after (un)successful treatment related to pregnancy, birth, and/or psychological counseling. Second, there may be discussion as to whether costs related to pregnancy itself should be included in a cost-per-pregnancy analysis or whether delivery and postnatal follow-up care should be included in a cost-per-(healthy)-live-birth calculation. As the goal of such analyses is to identify the most cost-effective intervention to reach the well-defined objective of pregnancy or live birth, all later costs associated with reaching that goal could potentially be ignored.13 Guidelines prescribe that costs and outcomes should be counted over an equally long time horizon, meaning that, for example, a cost-per-(healthy)-live-birth calculation requires a time horizon up to the moment of childbirth.54 In addition, including these costs might make MAR treatments with a low probability of live births more cost-effective, which is counterintuitive.13 However, one could also argue that these costs are inseparable from pregnancy and delivery, and it would therefore be illogical not to include them. Third, many of the benefits of MAR go beyond health-realted QoL, as they tap into the “well-being” of parents rather than their “health,” with the former typically being broader conceived than the latter, including life satisfaction and personal goals such as self-realization instead of only physical or mental health outcomes. In fact, even the disease status of infertility, and hence the health-improving capacity of MAR, is not universally accepted.144,145 If classified as well-being benefits rather than health improvements, they are to be excluded from the cost-per-QALY calculation, focusing on health only, but not from BCRs. However, the parental well-being effects caused by having children can, over time, have significant feedback effects on the health of parents (e.g., depression), which then might need to be reflected into QALYs (although their indirect nature may again be a source of dispute). Fourth, and perhaps most importantly, there is ongoing discussion as to whether the future costs and outcomes of a not-yet-existing child should count in resource allocation decisions. On one hand, guidelines indicate that all economic or health consequences of an intervention, for all affected parties, should be included.54,143,146 As the future, not-yet-existing child will be a real consequence of a MAR treatment, in terms of both costs and outcomes, neglecting it would underestimate the value for money of MAR treatments. However, consistently following this approach (not only for MAR but also for all other interventions that somehow affect fertility) leads to strongly counterintuitive results. Therefore, analysts have argued to exclude future children’s outcomes as part of the cost-effectiveness of a MAR treatments.13,14,61 When including them in cost-per-QALY or BCR calculation, this would arguably make a substantial difference to the cost-effectiveness of MAR, as a lifetime of costs and outcomes might need to be counted (i.e., a lifetime of the future children would generate about 70 QALYs, on top of those received by the parents11,12,60). Discussing this complex subject about the moral status of future lives would, however, be beyond the scope of this article (see Luyten et al.14 for a more elaborate discussion).
Our study has the following limitations. First, our search strategy for the systematic review may have missed economic evaluations published outside of our search period or in non-English languages. It was also centered around specific types of MAR treatments, while there are many other fertility-enhancing interventions, such as lifestyle programs, which were considered out of scope. Second, although we reviewed studies according to the best of our abilities, sometimes unavoidable assumptions had to be made. For instance, some studies did not specify the perspective adopted, and we therefore classified it in the most logical category. Furthermore, we made the assumption that all costs and outcomes are “related,” that is, they directly follow and are closely connected to the intervention. There is a debate among health economists about “unrelated” costs being justifiably excludable or not.147–149 In our analysis, we included all costs and outcomes for which evidence can be found in the literature, including those that might be labeled as potentially unrelated by some. Also, our Figure 1 encompasses all possible consequences supported by evidence that arise from undergoing MAR treatments, but for some of them (e.g., counseling costs after infertility), it is not entirely evident that the relationship with MAR is a causal one rather than one of association. Third, our categorization of costs and outcomes also identified several areas where guidelines are unclear about inclusion or exclusion. We only touched upon these subjects, and it was beyond the scope of this study to provide a more in-depth discussion about the arguments pro and contra inclusion. Future research is needed to address these issues in more detail.
In conclusion, as MAR treatments expand, policy makers need to understand their (health-)economic value to make informed reimbursement decisions. Such information is important for clinics, patients, and other involved stakeholders. Our review has shown that available cost-effectiveness evidence focuses on the narrower question of which technique provides the least costly way to a pregnancy or live birth. Broader assessments that can inform the debate about the size of MAR budgets relative to other health domains are scarce, and the studies available often neglect important costs and outcomes. MAR also highlights several gaps in the current HTA framework regarding which costs and outcomes to include, particularly those related to the future child. Our Figure 1 can assist future researchers in determining which costs and outcomes to account for in their study or to discuss to which extent their analysis has neglected relevant dimensions. In addition, it provides suggestions for further conceptual research on the development of HTA methodologies.
