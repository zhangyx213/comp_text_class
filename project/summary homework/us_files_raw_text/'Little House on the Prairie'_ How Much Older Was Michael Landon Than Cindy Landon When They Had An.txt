While many blamed his alleged mistress, he said his marital problems had nothing to do with Cindy.'Lynn and I fought a lot, about jealousy, about my being tied up with my work,' he told the press, per INSP[8]. 'I'd go into depressed moods, and then I'd go around screaming at people at home and in the studio. Nobody's perfect. Not Charles Ingalls. Not Michael Landon.'

She also said she felt torn between her dad and Noe.'Dad was involved with a woman half his age, a woman a few years younger than even I,' she wrote. 'He first saw her on the set of Little House on the Prairie, and she had her eye on him too.''Dad was depressed and confused,' Cheryl continued. 'He never stood a chance against a younger woman. She was after him, and the timing was perfect. He was only human. I didn't want to blame him; I wanted to blame the circumstances.' Did Cindy Landon get remarried after Michael Landon died?
