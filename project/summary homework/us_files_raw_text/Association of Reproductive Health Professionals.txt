This site has everything you wanted to know about contraception but were afraid to ask -- if you're female. It's a comprehensive site that addresses options for preventing pregnancy, as well as safety and health issues.
At the very least, it will help you converse with health professionals; at best, it will give you enough knowledge to make educated decisions. But there's a big gap: Thirty minutes perusing every corner of this site found one page dedicated to men. Much of that was about sexual dysfunction, and only a half-dozen paragraphs were dedicated to male options for contraception -- and they weren't very good. Considering that new methods -- such as reversible vasectomies and even a male birth control pill -- are hot topics, there's a range of areas that this site fails to address.
