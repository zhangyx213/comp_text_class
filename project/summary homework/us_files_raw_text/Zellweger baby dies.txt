Gabriel Johnson Guthrie, the infant boy who made news even before he was born, is dead. Guthrie was the third child of David and Nancy Guthrie -- and their second to die of Zellweger syndrome, a rare genetic disorder for which there is no cure. The Nashville couple made national news when Nancy Guthrie got pregnant with Gabriel, despite incredible odds against it.
The San Diego Union-Tribune carried the story last summer. The odds of two carriers meeting and having a child with this syndrome are about 1 in 100,000. So it was extremely rare that Hope, their second child, was born with Zellweger (their first child, Matt, is healthy). Hope lived less than seven months. David Guthrie got a vasectomy -- but Nancy Guthrie became pregnant despite the roughly 1 in 2,000 odds against conception after a vasectomy. Bucking further odds, prenatal tests revealed that this fetus had Zellweger.
The Guthries, devout evangelical Christians, decided to go through with the pregnancy. "If God would ask me to suffer this significantly, I think he has something significant he wants to do with it through me, if only just in my heart," Nancy Guthrie said at the time. Gabriel was born July 16 and died Jan. 15.
