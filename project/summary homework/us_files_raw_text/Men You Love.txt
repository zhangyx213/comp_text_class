Tall, dark, and handsome? Not-so-tall, blonde, and boyish? According to our online poll of 1722 Marie Claire readers, your fantasy men come in all shapes and sizes. Find out who you chose as the  man you'd most like to paint your toenails, see naked, and grab a brewski with
1. ...THE MAN YOU'D MOST LIKE TO BRING HOME  TO MOM... MATT DAMON
YOU SAY: "He's very down-to-earth and seems like he would impress any mother very well. And he's dating a noncelebrity, so  he obviously isn't into the whole Hollywood scene." -Sabrina, 25
HE SAYS: "We [my family] have to be vigilant, stay in contact, see each other as much as we can. When I'm not working,  I'm just your average, run-of-the-mill actor who goes home and hangs out."
2. ...MARRY: KEANU REEVES
YOU SAY: "He's soft-spoken, tall, dark,  and handsome-isn't  that the idea  of a perfect man?"
-Colleen, 26
HE SAYS: "It's fun  to be hopelessly in  love. It's dangerous,  but it's fun."
3. ...CLIMB A  MOUNTAIN WITH: LANCE ARMSTRONG
YOU SAY: "He's somebody who doesn't give up. He's tenacious and focused, but he has a heart of gold." -Sonia, 31
HE SAYS: "Once, someone asked me what pleasure I took in riding for  so long. 'Pleasure?' I said.   'I don't understand the question.' I didn't do it for pleasure. I did it for pain."
4. ...HAVE A BABY WITH: GEORGE CLOONEY 
YOU SAY: "Well, he has  a pet pig, so if he can manage a swine he might be good about helping with diapers." -Sara, 23
HE SAYS: "After doing One Fine Day and playing  a pediatrician on ER, I will never have children. I'm going to get a vasectomy. No, I just think they're  a huge responsibility, and I'm probably not the most responsible guy in the world, so I don't think  I want to jump into that."
5. ...GET A  MASSAGE  FROM: BRAD PITT
YOU SAY: "I'm sure he has a nice pair of hands to go with that body!"   -Jennifer, 26
HE SAYS: "The body is an amazing thing. If you tell it that it needs to perform, and you feed it the proper fuel, it will acclimate."
6. ...DISCUSS CURRENT EVENTS WITH: JON STEWART
YOU SAY: "His charisma, intelligence, and news savvy, combined with a love for comedy, would make him a great conversation partner."
-Stephanie, 24
HE SAYS: "As a fake anchorman of a fake  news show, I for one am proud to see our commitment to journalistic falsehood catching on."
7. ... CHEER  YOU UP ON  A BAD DAY: WILL SMITH
YOU SAY: "He seems like the type of guy who'd go all out to make you laugh."  -Karen, 21
HE SAYS: "For my creative mind to be engaged,  I need everybody in the vicinity to be in a good mood. So if someone's having a bad day in the room,  I feel the need to perk  that person up and try to make them laugh."
8. ...SEE NAKED: DAVID BECKHAM
YOU SAY: "Well, he looks pretty damn good with his clothes on, so  I can only imagine what's underneath." -Kate, 25
HE SAYS: "I just like  to look good. I don't  love myself, and I don't think I'm vain. Do you think I'm vain?"
9. ...PAINT YOUR TOENAILS: JOHNNY DEPP
YOU SAY: "I think it would be funny-he probably paints his own toenails!" -Karin, 22
HE SAYS: "I wouldn't say I'm  a heartthrob. I just have  a very weird job."
10. ...GRAB A  BEER WITH: COLIN FARRELL
YOU SAY: "He's definitely a party animal-it would be a memorable night."  -Dorothy, 26
HE SAYS: "I don't go to the gym or practice yoga. And the closest thing I have to a nutritionist is the Carlsberg Beer company."
