BREATHE EASY, boys - getting a vasectomy doesn't increase your risk of prostate cancer.
As if getting snipped weren't scary enough, a 2014 study had suggested a link between vasectomies and developing cancer.
But now scientists from the American Cancer Society have given that old research the shaft.
The new study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology analyzed data from almost 364,000 men in a cancer-prevention study from 1982 to 2012.
Some 42,000 of them had a vasectomy - and 7,451 died of prostate cancer, compared with the 2014 report that looked at just 800 cancer cases.
Researchers found no difference between the rates of prostate cancer diagnosis or death between patients who had vasectomies and those who didn't.
"The overall weight of all of the evidence is that vasectomy is unlikely to meaningfully increase risk of any type of prostate cancer," said Dr. Eric Jacobs, who led the study.
The experts found that more cases of prostate cancer were maybe detected in men who've had vasectomies because those guys often get more medical checkups, which would increase the likelihood of cancer detection.
