Dear Abby: I had been single a long time when I married a wonderful man, “Edgar,” who had custody of his two children. After we had dated awhile, he told me about his vasectomy. He said he and his wife had agreed not to have any more children. As our relationship progressed, Edgar told me he would have the vasectomy reversed if I wanted to have children which I said I de initely did. After two years of marriage, I inally brought up the subject.
Edgar then informed me he didn’t want to reverse the operation. He said he couldn’t handle having another child. Abby, I am crushed. I thought Edgar loved me enough to give me children out of our union and love. I love his children and wouldn’t favor our children over his. 
I would never consider leaving Edgar over this, but I don’t know if I can ever forgive him for deceiving me and leading me on. My husband has denied me the children he knew I so desperately wanted. 
Abby, I urge couples who may ind themselves in a similar situation to be honest with each other before they marry.  Childless And Heartbroken 
Dear Childless And Heartbroken: Many churches  and some states  now encourage couples who are considering marriage to go through prenuptial counseling to ensure compatibility. I’m all for it. If both parties are honest with each other, it could prevent a world of heartache down the line. 
You have my condolences for the children you and Edgar will never have together. While you would never leave him, his dishonesty is grounds for an annulment of the marriage.
