 Actor Seth Rogen waited a good 24 hours before sharing his thoughts about the Supreme Court's Hobby Lobby decision[1] on Twitter Tuesday. After discovering that Hobby Lobby has no problem covering vasectomies and Viagra for its male employees, Rogen tweeted this message:

 As of 1 p.m. ET, Rogen has only responded to one of his detractors:
 @tacjak[4] eat shit crap face.
