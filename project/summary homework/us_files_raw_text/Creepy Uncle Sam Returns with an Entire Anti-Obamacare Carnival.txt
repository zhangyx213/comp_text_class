 Because Creepy Uncle Sam was such a hit[1] (??!?!?!?!?), he's back in a new two-minute ad, traveling in a coal-rolling ice cream truck with a retinue of fire-breathers and dwarves and knife-throwers. The gag: 'They turned your health care into a freakshow.' There's a bit featuring literalizations of the terms 'dropped coverage' and 'high risk pools,' but aside from that the only time the ad and health care coincide is the word 'vasectomy,' which continues 2014 as the GOP's Year of the Groin[2].
 The ads are made by Generation Opportunity, a Koch Brothers-funded anti-Obamacare group that aims to steer youngsters away from the Affordable Care Act — not coincidentally, the same youngsters the state and federal exchanges need to balance insurance rates. The Creepy Uncle Sam ads debuted last September and promptly freaked everybody out[3]; Creepy Uncle Sam last appeared dancing to the hippity-hop[4] in May.
