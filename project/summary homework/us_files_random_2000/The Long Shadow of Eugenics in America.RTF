It's from a 1973 issue of Ebony magazine. The older of the two sisters, Minnie Lee, stares hard at the camera, her gaze direct and unsmiling but pleasant, almost quizzical. Her hair is freshly pressed, hot-curled and brushed into place, making her look older than 14. In a clean white dress with lacy zigzags, she seems ready for Sunday school. Her left arm is draped around her baby sister, Mary Alice, age 12, anchoring her in place. The younger Relf sister cracks a big, playful smile, her hair in braids -- and not the usual three unruly braids from other pictures of the sisters during this time. Instead they are pinned down, neat and tidy for the Ebony shoot. The bottom of Mary Alice's schoolgirl dress is hiked up as she reaches up to rest her right arm, the one that's not fully formed, a disability she was born with, on her sister's shoulder.}

When I knocked on the door of the Relfs' home -- a cramped single-story apartment that looks like all the others in the public-housing complex -- Mary Alice yanked it open with a big smile, the same one in that picture from 49 years ago. She pulled me into the house and said something I didn't quite understand, though after spending time with her, I would come to better comprehend what on that day was a raspy collection of sounds, resulting from a speech impediment and an intellectual disability that make communication difficult for her. }

''I'm sorry, ma'am, I can't stand up for you,'' she said politely, pointing down to her right foot. It was in a bulky gray cast. While reaching for a can of string beans in her kitchen cabinet the week before, she lost her balance and fractured it in three places.}

The Relf case would change the course of history: A lawsuit filed on their behalf, Relf v. Weinberger, helped reveal that more than 100,000 mostly Black, Latina and Indigenous women were sterilized under U.S. government programs over decades. It also officially ended this practice and forced doctors to obtain informed consent before performing sterilization procedures -- though as it would turn out, forced sterilizations by state governments would continue into the 21st century.}

Nearly all of these laws have been repealed (in Washington State, a version of the law still remains on the books). Indiana, Virginia and North Carolina have created historical markers to commemorate those who were sterilized through government-sanctioned programs. Eight states have issued official apologies.}

Vermont state legislators apologized for using forced sterilizations and other practices to reduce populations deemed unfit to have children -- including Indigenous and mixed-race people, people with disabilities and low-income families. ''For those that were directly impacted, for their descendants, and for all of the communities involved, we cannot undo the trauma that this moment has caused, but we can start by formally acknowledging this dark period in our state's history. Today, we publicly apologize for the Legislature's role in ever allowing this to occur.''}

Mary Alice, sitting on a floral-patterned chair next to her, with a poster of the Last Supper displayed in an ornate plastic frame on a nearby wall, watched intently, her glasses pushed up on her face. Her half arm rested lightly on her thigh as she leaned in to listen to her sister.

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2   By the 1930s, women became a majority of the victims, sterilized in mental hospitals and prisons and under court orders. This shifting gender pattern resulted from a rising concern about the fitness to parent, with a focus on mothering, as well as the development of a safer, standardized tubal-ligation procedure for sterilizing women. The movement was codified in 1927, when the Supreme Court upheld the right of the state of Virginia to sterilize Carrie Buck, a 20-year-old white woman. Born in 1906 to a mother living in poverty in Virginia, Buck was sent to a working-class foster home, where at age 16 she was raped by an extended-family member. Her foster parents took custody of Buck's daughter and successfully petitioned a local court to confine Buck at the Virginia State Colony for Epileptics and Feeble-Minded -- though she was neither epileptic nor intellectually disabled. There she was sterilized without her consent. Writing for the majority in the landmark Supreme Court case Buck v. Bell, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. stated, ''It is better for all the world, if instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime, or to let them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind.'' He added, ''Three generations of imbeciles are enough.''}

Germany's Law for the Prevention of Offspring and Hereditary Diseases focused on people with a high probability of having a child with a serious ''defect,'' including blindness, deafness and manic depression. The last eugenics legislation in the United States was passed in Georgia in 1937, and eventually the laws would be rolled back in a series of repeals. But that didn't stop local governments from sterilizing many more people, mostly women of color. The voting rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer was given a hysterectomy without her consent in 1961 when undergoing removal of a uterine tumor by a white physician. The practice of being sterilized, including during unrelated surgery, grew so common among poor Black women in the South that it came to be known as a ''Mississippi appendectomy.''}

Her employer, the City of St. Jude Catholic Church, was founded by a progressive Catholic priest in the 1930s to serve as a ''center for the religious, charitable, educational and industrial advancement of the Negro people.'' Bly was born and raised in Montgomery; her mother was a housekeeper and her father a gravedigger. They understood early that their seventh child was bright and engaged, and they sent her to private school. She was the only one of eight siblings to finish college.

Some former field workers went North, but others crowded into Southern cities like Montgomery, the state capital. Census data shows that in 1960, for the first time, Alabama's urban population exceeded the rural population, in a state that was nearly one-third Black. This influx of rural Black residents, most unskilled and lacking education, increased poverty in the Black communities in a number of Southern cities. But even if Lonnie Relf had been able to find a job in Montgomery, he was disabled in an accident and was unable to work.}

Bly worries, years later, that visiting the government-funded diagnostic facility put the Relf girls on the radar of the family-planning clinic that would eventually arrange the sterilizations. More likely, they were flagged by the government services they were receiving: food stamps, a $156 monthly check from the Alabama Department of Pensions and Security, medical benefits and a subsidized apartment in public housing.}

That year, President Lyndon Johnson initiated his ambitious multibillion-dollar Great Society agenda, which would lead to Medicare, Medicaid, Head Start, the distribution of food stamps and other programs in an effort to end poverty and hunger, reduce crime, abolish inequality and racial barriers and improve the environment. Also under the auspices of the O.E.O., in 1967 the U.S. government created its family-planning program, which was intended to help poor people prevent unwanted births through contraception and other reproductive-health services.}

This term, popularized by the Stanford University professor Paul Ehrlich -- and the title of his 1968 best-selling book -- referred to an exaggerated population explosion that he incorrectly predicted would lead to global famine in the 1970s and 1980s. Nixon championed the Family Planning Services and Population Research Act of 1970, also known as the Birth Curb Bill, a $382 million federal program to control population growth, which had ballooned into a national obsession.}

Though the initial O.E.O. regulations of 1967 stated that ''no project funds shall be expended for any surgical procedures intended to result in sterilization or to cause abortions,'' the prohibition on funding voluntary sterilization ended in 1971. ''The '70s and '80s were this kind of interesting moment where at the same time state sterilization laws were being repealed, America was creating the conditions for the sterilization of the Relf sisters,'' says Dr. Stern of the University of Michigan Sterilization and Social Justice Lab. ''The federal government funneled money into county family-planning programs, especially in the South,'' she continues. ''These facilities were twisted by racial and eugenic logics and pre-existing, longstanding racism and disempowerment of Black mothers and Black girls. Yet there were no checks on anything.''}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2   According to the Relf v. Weinberger lawsuit, not long after the family moved into public housing, the Relf sisters were directed to the family-planning clinic of the Montgomery Community Action Committee, which was funded and controlled by the federal O.E.O. The process began with Katie, the oldest of the three girls, who was about 16 when she was first injected with the contraceptive Depo-Provera. At that time, the drug was still in the investigational phase and not yet approved by the F.D.A. for administration to adult women, let alone minor teenagers. Between 1967 and 1978, during a clinical trial of Depo-Provera, the Grady Memorial Hospital Family Planning Clinic in Atlanta administered the drug to 11,400 mostly poor Black women despite serious side effects, including heavy or interrupted menstrual bleeding and near suicidal depression.}

Sometime later, Minnie Lee and Mary Alice were also injected with Depo-Provera. Bly remembers that a member of the staff would later explain the decision by saying that she was worried that ''boys are hanging around the house, and we don't want no more of their kind,'' though there was no evidence that any of the girls were sexually active. The Relf sisters were judged to be intellectually inferior, though only Mary Alice would be diagnosed with an actual disability. The other two girls lacked formal education and were struggling to catch up to their peers. In March 1973, Katie, then 17, was again taken to the family-planning clinic, this time for insertion of an IUD, after the Food and Drug Administration denied approval of Depo-Provera because of its link to cancer in animals. Though Katie was under the age of consent, her parents would later insist that they were not consulted about the IUD.}

Minnie's two younger girls, then 14 and 12, were driven first to a doctor's office and then to the Professional Center Hospital in downtown Montgomery. Later, when she met them at the hospital, health care providers told Minnie she needed to sign a paper. It is unclear what Minnie Relf understood, but she trusted her daughters in the hands of the staff at this clinic, sponsored by the same government that had given her family a home, food, money and an education for her children. Still, it is very clear from her later Senate testimony that she had no idea that signing the piece of paper would mean that her daughters would never be able to bear children. Because she could not read or write, Minnie signed what turned out to be a surgical consent form with an X and was then escorted out to be driven home while the younger girls remained alone in the ward.}

District Court, a Black woman from North Carolina, Nial Ruth Cox, also filed a suit against a number of people, including the doctor who had surgically sterilized her after telling her, she claimed, that the results would ''wear off.'' At the time of the sterilization in 1965, Cox was 18, unmarried and the mother of a baby girl. Cox lived with her mother, who was a recipient of government benefits. A county caseworker threatened to strike the family from the welfare rolls unless the mother agreed to have her daughter's tubes temporarily tied. Five years later, Cox would learn that the sterilization was permanent. Though Cox -- who was represented by several lawyers, including the future Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg -- lost in court, her suit revealed that her sterilization was part of a eugenics program, created under state law, that began decades earlier.}

In California, more than 17,000 were sterilized between 1920 and 1945 under a state eugenics law used to prevent reproduction of those deemed ''unfit''; a disproportionate number were women of Mexican descent. In 1976, a study by the U.S. General Accounting Office found that between 1973 and 1976, four of the 12 Indian Health Service regions sterilized 3,406 Native American women without their permission, including three dozen who were under 21. Also in 1976, H.E.W. reported that over 37 percent of Puerto Rican women of childbearing age, most in their 20s, were sterilized between the 1930s and the 1970s. The U.S. government had taken an active role in population control beginning in 1898, when it assumed governance of Puerto Rico, on the supposed grounds that overpopulation would increase poverty and other social and economic conditions.}

Many others were coerced into sterilization when health care providers threatened to cut off their benefits unless they agreed to give up their fertility. The Relfs' suit ended these practices, and H.E.W. was forced to withdraw regulations under which the government funded forced sterilizations. The federal government also instituted a requirement that health care providers obtain informed consent before performing sterilization procedures -- more than the X Minnie Relf had signed.}

In 2013, the Center for Investigative Reporting found that physicians under contract with the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation sterilized nearly 150 female inmates from 2006 to 2010 without required state approvals for the tubal ligations the women received. According to the reporting, prison staff coerced or pressured women they believed likely to return to prison. State documents and interviews pointed to some 100 more procedures dating back to the late 1990s: ''From 1997 to 2010, the state paid doctors $147,460 to perform the procedure, according to a database of contracted medical services for state prisoners,'' C.I.R. reported.}

In the fall of 2020, a nurse at a for-profit Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Georgia reported that unnecessary gynecological procedures -- including hysterectomies -- had been performed on undocumented migrant women. The women said that they had undergone the operations without fully understanding or consenting to them.

Loud and outrageous, Belli was best known for his celebrity clients: Errol Flynn, Mae West, Lana Turner, Lenny Bruce, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Muhammad Ali and the Rolling Stones. In February 1974, Belli's firm filed a $5 million damages suit on behalf of the Relfs against the former White House aides Dean and Ehrlichman and other federal officials for blocking the distribution in 1972 of federal guidelines that would have prevented the Relf sterilizations. After that suit was dismissed, Belli followed with another suit for $15 million that July.}

The organization estimated that between 1,500 and 2,000 survivors might be alive and recommended paying $50,000 to each. In 2013, the State Legislature set aside $10 million. According to Lombardo, the Georgia State University College of Law professor, nearly 800 North Carolinians filed claims, with 220 qualifying for financial restitution.

From 1909 through 1979, under state eugenics laws, thousands of people who lived in California state-run hospitals, homes and institutions were sterilized. Even after those laws were repealed in 1979, forced or coerced sterilizations continued to be performed on people in custody at state prisons or other correctional facilities. More than 20,000 people were sterilized in California, more than in any other state, and about 600 survivors are still alive today and eligible for compensation.

''These women bear a mark of being deemed less than a full person. That moral harm has to be addressed by an apology, and it must come from the state. But they are also owed material redress, some sort of financial repair. That's what is clearly acknowledged in the Virginia, North Carolina and California initiatives: that practices of truth telling, repair and reparation must come into play when formal law fails.''}

But it is hauntingly, painfully clear that she understands what she and Mary Alice lost. When I visited, I saw that each woman slept with a brown baby doll, Mary Alice's nestled in a tangle of sheets, Minnie Lee's laid across her pillow. ''I know I can't have kids, and it gets to me sometimes,'' Minnie Lee says. ''Every time I see somebody like my cousin or my niece Debbie with their child, I think about it. Seeing these little pretty babies, I wish that was me.''}
