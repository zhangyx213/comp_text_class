 The American Agent
 by Richard Holm
 Time Warner $ 310
 On paper, this Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) memoir is irresistible. It boasts more moments of gung-ho machismo than Ernest Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises.
 A superb sportsman at college in Illinois during the early 1950s, Richard Holm signs up for peacetime military service in France then, for some thrills, heads for Pamplona, in Spain, where he spots Hemingway and runs with the bulls.
Strongly motivated by patriotism, Holm joins the CIA in 1961. His career begins the following year in Laos, where he is greeted by a giant of a man who bellows: "Jesus Christ, we asked em to send us more men and they sent us a bunch of kids. They look green as grass."
 Later transferred to the Congo, Holm is injured in a plane crash. His eyelids singed shut, he half-climbs, half-stumbles out of the cockpit ("the fire was a great motivator") just before the aircraft explodes.
 After his recovery, he runs agents from Hong Kong into China between 1969 and 1981, then returns to America as chief of the Counter-Terrorist Centre and helps hunt down and arrest Carlos the Jackal who, in a deliciously absurd episode, is carted off strapped to a hospital trolley after a reverse -vasectomy operation.
 Rather wild, given that he hails from a modest, middle-class family of Swedish immigrants, Holm tempers his story with some trenchant political commentary. He chastises the CIA for cultivating "choir boys" and "boy scouts" while shunning villains who might have access to some useful information. He is also provocative on the threat of terrorism: "Our terrorist enemies … can attack us any time, anywhere and via any means they choose," he writes. His solution? Beat them to the punch.
 Yet the book fails to deliver. Holm insists on depicting the CIA like a gentleman's club guilty only of the occasional "contretemps". Where are the assassinations, the atrocities, the brainwashing? Holm goes in more for whitewashing and his story reads like a CIA advertisement, which goes: "Join the CIA, see the world, meet interesting people and treat them fairly - extreme prejudice sometimes necessary."
 Holm spins out his story with tennis anecdotes. This can be exciting as when he plays a round with Ken Rosewall in Hong Kong before the 1971 Open tournament: "It was quite a thrill for me to play with a player of his calibre who was also a true gentleman."
 However, most memorable CIA memoirs are not written by congenial hosts too discreet to mention the unpleasant necessities of their profession but by renegades. Think See No Evil by the self-styled "cowboy" Robert Baer who described "the conference tables of official Washington" as being "often as nasty as a snake pit in Lebanon's Biqa Valley". Holm, although no angel, is just too much of a good guy to blow the reader away.
