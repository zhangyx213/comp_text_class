   China allows township hospitals to   give clinical services of birth control, which was provided at         hospitals of county level or higher, if they have qualified personnel  and facilities.
    Township hospitals are allowed to do birth control operations,      including inserting and taking out Intrauterine Device (IUD),          vasectomy, tubectomy and induced abortion within 12 weeks of           pregnancy, according to a newly-amended government regulation on       birth control techniques, released by the State Council on December    26.
    The regulation also required hospitals to hire at least one         practicing doctor and equip themselves with relevant facilities,       medicines and management if they wants to do vasectomy, tubectomy and  induced abortion. Those that only conduct IUD operations must hire at  least one assistant practicing doctor.
    The country only allowed hospitals of county and higher levels to   do birth control surgeries and consultation before the regulation was  amended.
    In many places of China township hospitals are grass roots medical  service institutions while villages have individual doctors.
    Couples in rural areas will enjoy free birth control operations     funded by the government and the central government will give          subsidies to less developed regions in west China, according to the    regulation.
    Hospitals that violate this rule will be fined twice to five times  that of the charge and hospital directors will be demoted ordismissed  for a serious violation.
    The health authorities across the country are asked to check upall  township hospitals in their districts for their qualification to do    birth control surgeries in the six months after the amendment was      issued.
    Individual doctors are banned from doing any birth control          operation, the regulation said. They will be fined 5,000 to 20,000     yuan (604 to 2,418 US dollars), if earning less than 5,000 yuan from   the illegal operation, and twice to five times if the illegal income   is more than 5,000 yuan.
    The hospitals are also forbidden to hire unqualified workers        inbirth control operations and those treating sterility must have      licenses granted by provincial health authorities.
    The regulation also banned any operation to identify the gender of  unborn babies without clinical needs.
    China has adopted birth control policies for more than 20 years     encouraging one couple to have one child in a bid to slow down the     growth of its population, which now topped 1.3 billion. Enditem (?)
