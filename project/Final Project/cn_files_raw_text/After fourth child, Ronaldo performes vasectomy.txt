   Star soccer player Ronaldo  revealed on Sunday his recent vasectomy. The decision by the  athlete comes after recognition of five-year-old Alexandre as his  fourth child. 
    In 2010, Ronaldo received two additions to his family. On April  6, Maria Alice was born. Then, in December, Ronaldo learned of  Alexandre. After performing DNA tests, Ronaldo accepted young Alex  as his fourth child. The striker declared that four is enough,  causing him to  "close the factory." 
    Ronaldo's other two children are named Ronald and Maria Sophia.  According to the striker, none of the kids are jealous of  Alexandre's surprise arrival into the family. Three of Ronaldo's  four kids were born in April (Ronald, Maria Alice and Alex),  causing the athlete to announce a super-party in April of next  year to celebrate all three birthdays at once.
