A four-month-old baby girl was taken to hospital yesterday after a viral video of her living in squalor brought into question how social welfare programmes should ­handle poor families with ­children.
Tang Lu is being raised by Huang Longfei, 59, a farmer from Hunan province, and her ­mentally handicapped mother.
The family, which includes a ­five-year-old girl born to a different woman, lives in an environment surrounded by filth.
The mother is bedridden, and the family survives on the father's meagre salary.
In the video, Huang lays his daughter on a jacket amid ­rubbish. Flies flit around the baby's face. Another video shows the father ­hiding her in a rotting paper box amid pigswill in a trailer behind a motorbike.
Volunteers tried to help the family and teach the man about raising children in more sanitary conditions but said their efforts were futile. "He does not get ­better at all," said Jelly Liu, a ­children's rights activist who ­noticed the family and reported them to the local government last month.
Liu said the family lived in ­unsanitary conditions, and the father refused to change or give up custody of the baby girl ­despite his failure to care for the children.
"We tried to persuade him to have a vasectomy, but he refused and said he wanted to have sons".
The county's women's federation said a physical check-up last month showed the baby was healthy, and the government was not considering finding her ­another guardian.
The township government had given Huang a job with a ­monthly salary of 1,000 yuan (HK$1,200) and built a 70 square metre home for the family, it said.
Liu said cases similar to the Huang family were common as China lacked a proper system to protect disadvantaged children.
"I have intervened in at least seven such cases this year, where healthy men keep a sexual ­relationship with a mentally ­challenged woman and have ­children with her. In some cases, they have like nine or 10 kids," she said.
"I don't see any point in giving taxpayers' money to such men. It's the woman and children who need help," Liu said.
Huang's story generated debate on social media, with many demanding the government take over custody of the children and send the woman to a hospital.
"Poor baby. The parents are so ignorant, and the government should be blamed for their lack of education," one person on ­Weibo said.
