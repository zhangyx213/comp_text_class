SYDNEY, July 10  (Xinhua)  -- This October, bold Aussie men  will prove that courage is not skin deep, family planning cuts  both ways and saving the environment begins at home when they line  up in public for the world's first "vasectomy-athon" in October. 
   October 18, 2013 will be the first World Vasectomy Day and in a  quiet corner of Australia a very different kind of marathon will  cut through the silence on male contraception. 
    The scene will be beautiful Adelaide, Australia's City of  Churches, the star - the world's most prolific vasectomist, Dr  Doug Stein. 
    The mission  to publically perform surgical vasectomies on a  conga-line of Aussie men before a live audience at Adelaide's  Royal Institution of Australia (RiAus) to launch the inaugural  World Vasectomy Day. 
    RiAus Director, Paul Willis told reporters the unique event was  about innovating through multiple platforms, some of the critical  scientific issues of the age. 
    "(We will) take vasectomy out of the medical suite and into the  homes of people who may never have considered vasectomy." He said. 
    But lets rewind. 
    A vasectomy is a brief surgical procedure that effectively  sterilizes a man. 
    This permanent form of contraception involves cutting and  blocking off the tubes in the groin (the vas) that carry sperm  from the testicles to the penis. 
    According to Australia's office of Family Planning, the  existing sperm are reabsorbed into the body over time with no ill  effects, while the chances of pregnancy after having a vasectomy  are around one in 1,000. 
    The operation doesn't interfere with a man's sexual desire or  his ability to reach orgasm and despite previous concerns, there  is no proven link to prostate cancer or heart disease. 
    World Vasectomy Day is the creation of Oscar-nominated and Emmy  Award-winning documentary filmmaker Jonathan Stack, who while  setting out to tell his own story about getting a vasectomy, met  legendary Florida-based vasectomist Dr Doug Stein and together,  ended up making a film about population on the planet sensibly  titled The Vasectomist. 
    The event will be broadcast live across the internet and will  incorporate an interactive audience debate, ranging from a  burgeoning global population, environmental issues, the future of  the planet and family planning. 
    "We're encouraging men around the world to basically put their  balls on the line for the planet," Producer Ruth Cross said. 
    The goal is to raise global awareness of: the dangers an ever-  increasing population has on the planet's finite resources; and  vasectomy as a viable solution to prevent unintended pregnancies. 
    "We're asking men who do not want more children to shoulder the  burden of family planning, to fight for their family, their  community, their country and our planet," said Stack. 
    "By throwing our fertility into the fire, we're protecting our  women, our families and future generations." 
    Australia has one of the highest uptake rates of vasectomy in  the world and this trailblazing spirit led the producers to launch  WVD in Australia to set the stage for the global conversation. 
    Stein, who has performed more than 30,000 of the operations,  has been a controversial figure, the influential Australian  Medical Association (AMA) has already flagged  concerns about the  safety of such an ambitious public event that incorporates  delicate surgery. 
    For several years, Australia has been something of the  vasectomy capital of the world. 
    According to family planning charity Marie Stopes one in every  three Aussie men aged in their mid forties to fifties have 'had  the snip.' 
    A spokesman for the RiAus said the institution had solid  interest from men wanting to be involved and was investigating the  potential of hosting other vasectomy-athons across Australia. 
    Professor Paul Ehrlich author of The Population Bomb will lead  discussions on the social, political, cultural and ethical issues  raised by the event and Dr Stein's mission to save the planet, one  vasectomy at a time. 
    According to Ehrlich there is value in putting your balls on  the line for the a good cause. 
    "Can vasectomies really make a difference? Mine made a big  difference in my life, and to this day, I consider it the single  most important contribution I have personally made to the  wellbeing of future generations, " says Ehrlich.
