 A senior government minister has expressed the hope that China will become the world's leading exporter of contraceptive products in five to 10 years.
 However, leading sex experts said domestic demand should remain the country's top priority.
 Speaking at a national conference on Monday, Minister of Population and Family Planning Zhang Weiqing said China's reproductive health industry should play a greater role in meeting the demands for contraceptive products from abroad, especially from developing countries.
China has invested heavily in the research and development of reproductive health products such as contraceptives.
 The ministry has spent more than 58 million yuan (HK$ 54.5 million) on 11 research projects on contraceptives and conducted extensive research on reversible vasectomy operations, Zhang Shikun, director of its science and technology department, was quoted by China Daily as saying.
 But Xu Tianmin, director of the China Sexology Association, a non-governmental organisation, said the mainland still faced many domestic issues.
 " Expansion of the reproductive health product industry is a good sign because more products can help prevent the spreading of diseases via sexual contact such as HIV leading to Aids.
 "But policy-makers should pay more attention to popularising ideas about contraceptives nationally - for example, lifting bans on condoms and other health reproductive products - which will also boost sales of these products."
 Although the mainland is a leading manufacturer of contraceptives and technology, public discussion of issues such as sex and birth control remains taboo with many.
 "And free condom distribution at universities is still up for debate," Mr Xu added.
 Last year, about 16 billion condoms were produced worldwide, 3.2 billion, or 20 per cent, of which were made on the mainland, the China Daily reported. It makes China the world's fourth largest manufacturer of condoms after Britain, the US and Japan.
 China uses about 2.2 billion condoms a year, 54 per cent of which are bought by the government and distributed for free. In addition, the country imports over 30 brands from 12 countries.
