   U.S. researchers said  Wednesday they have developed a low-cost and easy-to-use  smartphone device that can accurately measure semen quality in  seconds. 
    More than 45 million couples worldwide are affected by  infertility, but current standard methods for evaluating semen  quality, which require testing in a clinical setting, are  expensive, labor-intensive and slow to return results, according  to the study published in the U.S. journal Science Translational  Medicine. 
    "Men have to provide semen samples in these rooms at a  hospital, a situation in which they often experience stress,  embarrassment, pessimism and disappointment," Hadi Shafiee,  principal investigator at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, said  in a statement. 
    "We wanted to come up with a solution to make male infertility  testing as simple and affordable as home pregnancy tests." 
    In the new study, Shafiee and colleagues created a portable  device that quantified sperm concentration and motility in  seconds, using the processing power and camera found in  widely-available smartphones. 
    The analyzer, assembled for a total materials cost of less than  five U.S. dollars, consists of an optical attachment that can  connect to a smartphone and a disposable microchip onto which a  semen sample can be loaded. 
    The researchers analyzed 350 specimens, demonstrating that the  device was able to detect abnormal semen with either insufficient  sperm concentrations or low levels of motility with an accuracy of  98 percent. 
    "This test is low-cost, quantitative, highly accurate and can  analyze a video of an undiluted, unwashed semen sample in less  than five seconds," said Shafiee. 
    What's more, the test was so user-friendly that 10 volunteers  with no formal training correctly classified more than 100 semen  samples. 
    Study co-author John Petrozza, director of the Massachusetts  General Hospital Fertility Center, called the ability to bring  point-of-care sperm testing to consumers or health facilities with  limited resources "a true game changer." 
    "More than 40 percent of infertile couples have difficulty  conceiving due to sperm abnormalities," Petrozza said. "This  development will provide faster and improved access to fertility  care.... we have really been able to create a product that will  benefit a lot of people." 
    The researchers said the smartphone-based fertility test could  be also used by men to monitor their semen at home after  undergoing vasectomies or by animal breeders to confirm the  virility of a sample.
