BRITAIN’S biggest family is set to grow again after mother Sue Radford announced she is pregnant with her 21st child.

    Mrs. Radford uploaded a video message on YouTube to announce they will be welcoming yet another baby girl into their huge brood.

    The 43-year-old last gave birth in September last year, and she promised at the time that it would be her last.

    But they have revealed she has gotten pregnant yet again, and uploaded an image of the baby scan on Instagram.

    Mrs. Radford and her husband Noel, 47, who live in Morecambe, Lancashire, wrote, “We can’t wait to welcome you into the family precious little one..#soblessed.”

    The video shows the family revealing the sex of their next baby as they arrive home from the hospital. Surrounded by their children, they fire confetti cannons into the air, with pink paper streamers falling from the sky.

    After showing off her baby bump to the camera, Mrs. Radford said, “I honestly can’t believe it.

    “Normally I have an inkling of what the gender is going to be. I honestly thought it was going to be a boy.”

    Mrs. Radford adds, “We’re just in shock.”

    After she gave birth to her 11th son Archie in September after an hour’s labor she said she was happy to stop on a “nice even number.”

    Speaking at the time, Mr. Radford said, “It was going to end at some point.

    “We both think this is it. I feel sad in a way but now we can get on and enjoy the kids.”

    The couple also announced their last baby news by posting the ultrasound picture on social media.

    The couple, from Morecambe, Lancashire, first met when Sue was just 7 years old.

    They had their first child, Chris, 28 years ago, when Sue was aged only 14. The couple decided to keep the baby as they were both given up for adoption at birth.

    The couple then moved into their first home together and got married. Shortly afterwards they welcomed their second child, Sophie, when Sue was 17.

    Mrs. Radford lost a boy, Alfie in 2014, who was stillborn, but he is still very much part of the family.

    In July 2016 they welcomed baby number 19, Phoebe, and well-wishers sent the couple messages to congratulate them.

    Their new arrival will join Chris, Sophie, Chloe, Jack, Daniel, Luke, Millie, Katie, James, Ellie, Aimee, Josh, Max, Tillie, Oscar, Casper, Hallie, Phoebe, and Archie.

    They became grandparents when their daughter Sophie gave birth and she has gone on to have three children.

    The family now live in a large 240,000-pound (US$318,096) Victorian house, a former care home, that they bought 11 years ago and they pride themselves on having no credit cards or finance agreements. They also enjoy a holiday abroad every year.

    They spend 300 pounds a week on food shopping, with 18 pints of milk, three liters of juice and three boxes of cereal being consumed every day.

    When it comes to celebrating their children’s birthdays they have a budget of 100 pounds for presents, while at Christmas they set aside between 100 and 250 pounds.

    Her husband had a vasectomy during his wife’s ninth pregnancy but had it reversed when they decided to have more children.
