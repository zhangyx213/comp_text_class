 Brain drain
 French neurosurgeons have successfully destroyed  inoperable brain tumours in eight patients, using a tiny, water-cooled, fibre-optic laser inserted through a 3mm "ultra-keyhole" in their skulls. The volunteers, who had been diagnosed with only months to live, were given only local anaesthetic so the medical team from Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital in Paris could be sure no brain functions were being damaged during surgery. Most were able to leave hospital within 14 hours. The treatment requires at least two operations, AFP reports. Five of the six who have completed the full programme have suffered no relapse after nine months.
 Exercise helps
 Women who exercise regularly after being diagnosed with breast cancer - even if they've never done any before - have a better chance of surviving the disease, say Yale School of Medicine researchers  who studied almost 100 patients  for up to nine years. Those who  were active before diagnosis were  31 per cent less likely to die of the disease; those who were active two years after diagnosis had about a  65 per cent lower risk. However, those who cut back on exercise   were four times more likely to die than those who were sedentary and remained so, Reuters reports.
 Cell deficiency
 Fat cells in obese people are significantly deficient  in key areas, which may help  explain the link between obesity  and an increased risk of diabetes, heart disease and stroke, say researchers at Temple University  in Philadelphia. In particular,  obese people's fat cells show stresses that trigger the production of  certain proteins that lead to  insulin resistance. This, in turn, plays a key role in the development of obesity-related conditions, healthday.com reports.
 Walk to recovery
 Exercising on a treadmill may help stroke survivors better regain the ability to walk by rewiring the brain, say University of Maryland researchers. Treadmill patients performed better than those  given traditional stretching  therapy in terms of brain activity, walking ability and overall fitness, WebMD reports. While there  was no change in the brains of the stretch patients, those in the treadmill group registered as  much as 72 per cent more activity  in some parts of their brains. "It's promising that treadmill exercise can stimulate new or underused brain circuits," says team leader Andreas Luft.
 In the hot seat
 Men who like the comfort of heated car seats may  be at risk of vehicular vasectomy,  say researchers from Germany's University of Giessen in the latest issue of New Scientist. The optimal temperature for sperm production is one or two degrees below the core body temperature of 37 degrees Celsius, AFP reports. However, the testicular temperatures of 30 volunteers who sat on heated car seats for 90 minutes was an average 37.3C - and as high as 39.7C. Previous studies have found that simply sitting in a car for more than three hours can impair a man's ability to conceive.
 Social lubricant
 A condom lubricant designed for sex workers and gays has become popular with Cambodian women as an acne cure, AFP reports, quoting local media and several women who said they'd  used the water-based Number One Plus to treat skin problems. "After I used it for three days, all of my acne went away," a 29-year-old  woman said.  The product is produced by health organisation Population Services International, which was unavailable for comment.
