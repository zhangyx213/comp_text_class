LONDON, Oct. 14 (Xinhua) -- A British man diagnosed with HIV was on Tuesday found guilty of "callously" infecting two women with the deadly virus.
The jury at Inner London Crown Court ruled 37-year-old Mohammed Dica guilty of two counts of "biological" grievous bodily harm.
Prosecutor Mark Gadsden told the jury that grievous bodily harm could be used to describe someone being attacked with a hammer but could include psychological harm from being stalked or getting nuisance calls.
Dica, a father of three children who lived in southwestern London, had told police both women knew of his condition before they had sex, according to a BBC report.
But the court heard that he persuaded one woman to have unprotected sex by claiming that he had undergone a vasectomy and pursued the second victim, a mother of two, repeatedly telling her he loved her and wanted her to have his children.
The jury of six men and six women were told that both women could be dead in 10 years.
"He coldly and callously infected these two women," Gadsden told the jury. "There can be no better example of grievous bodily harm than infecting with HIV. Once one is infected that is the end of the story. It may take a while for you to die, but die you inevitably do."
The case is believed to be the first successful prosecution in England and Wales in over 100 years for sexually transmitting a disease.
