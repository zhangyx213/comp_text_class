   Not in the too distant past, South  Korea lauded families with only one child as exemplary and, at one  point, even tried luring men into getting vasectomies by offering  to exempt them from mandatory army reserve duty. 
    Those days are long gone, as South Korea becomes increasingly  desperate to do the exactly opposite and tackle its declining  birth rates, now one of the lowest in the world.   BABIES MISSING 
    In the country with the population of about 50 million, the  number of births of third children in 2009 fell five percent from  a year earlier to 42,100, the second lowest recorded number and  the biggest drop ever, recent statistics show. 
    The number of newborn babies stood at 445,200 in the same year,  also the second lowest in history and a half a little over half of  the total number of newborns in 1981. 
    The fertility rate stood at the average of 1.15 live births per  woman last year, a nosedive from 4.5 children per woman in the  1970s. 
    The figures are doubly discouraging for the South Korean  government, which since 1990s has sought ways to boost its  shrinking population by giving financial incentives and even  arranging blind dates for singles.   COPING MEASURES 
    Worried that the falling population would impeded the country's  growth potential, President Lee Myung-bak declared in June last  year that boosting birth rates is the "policy priority" for the  country, launching a national drive to halt the falling birthrate. 
    The government recently went as far as to announce a crackdown  on the country's rampant illegal abortion, to which it gave a  virtual green light for decades on concerns that a high birthrate  would drag down the economic growth. 
    Despite being accused of whipping up a stopgap and  anachronistic measure, health authorities here came up with  comprehensive measures against abortions, which include  establishing a "call center" that rewards informants giving tip-  offs on illegal abortion practitioners and criminally charging  hospitals performing such procedures. 
    Meanwhile, the Cabinet recently approved a plan to offer auto  tax incentives to parents of more than three children and give  subsidies of 1.5 million won (1,300 U.S. dollars) up to three  times to couples undergoing artificial insemination. 
    Local governments have also come out with various coping  measures, ranging from providing free meals for third children at  school to giving out one-time payments to families with three or  more children to providing nursery support. 
    "The district office is planning to build more nurseries at  workplaces by making full use of empty space in lobby areas of big  office buildings. It will help create a 'win-win' situation where  women get to worry less about their children and contribute more  to their career while companies don't need to see a further  workforce drain," said Na Seung-il, an official in charge of  family welfare programs at the Gangnam-gu Office in affluent  southern Seoul.   SEEDS OF PROBLEM 
    Experts and government officials here say a surge in the number  of career-conscious and unmarried female professionals plays a big  role in the grim picture, while married couples struggle with high  cost of raising a child and opt to stay away from another  headache. 
    South Korea's notoriously cut-throat education system is  another seed of the problem, as a prevalent distrust of the public  school system increasingly drives students into private education,  with the total money spent last year on private education reaching  21 trillion won (18.5 billion U.S. dollars). 
    "The biggest reason for the drop in the birth rate is the  general working conditions that are unfavorable to working moms,  as they often are left with no choice but to quit working or at a  disadvantage in promotion opportunities once they give birth," Na  said, lamenting the low birth rate last year of 0.8 babies per  woman in the highly rich district. 
    "Also, high education and childcare costs here are a huge  burden," he added.Others consider the issue a woman's right issue  and voice opposition to the notion that regards low birth rates as  a matter of national interest, calling birth rate policies a  violation of a woman's right to control her own life and body. 
    "The government policy cannot earn public trust as long as it  keeps on making flip-flops along the way, considering it regarded  couples having many children unpatriotic only three decades ago,"  Jeong Mun-sun, a female literary critic, recently wrote in a  column.
