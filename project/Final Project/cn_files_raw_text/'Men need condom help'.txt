 Clinics are needed to give men advice about sex because many hold outdated views about fertility and do not know how to put on a condom, a leading doctor said yesterday.
 Dr Leong Che-hung, a council member of the Family Planning Association and former legislator for the medical functional constituency, said advances in reproductive science had largely gone over local men's heads.
 "In Hong Kong, male sex counselling and reproductive health services are not adequately provided for," he said. "In a recent survey by the Aids Foundation on the use of condoms among university students it was found to our horror that many did not even know how to put on the device.
"Perhaps it's high time to extend the male services section of the Family Planning Association and, in light of a possible or expected rise in HIV infections through cross-border spread, it's high time that public male service centres along the same lines as the well-woman clinics should be considered."
 The Family Planning Association offers couples advice and check-ups before marriage and before trying to conceive, gives out condoms and advice on vasectomies to men and holds clinics for men and women at three of its youth health care centres for people under 26. It has set up a working group to discuss how to better provide for the needs of men. Dr Leong said many of men's ideas about fertility were outdated and incorrect. "In the Chinese culture in particular, the accusing finger is always pointed at the wife in an infertile marriage or when a male child is not produced. Sometimes even the mother-in-law will join the rampage," he said.
 "Modern science demonstrates that a high percentage of infertile marriages stem from the husband, and that a female child is the main responsibility of the type of sperm in the male."
