 The Family Way

 "Your parents ruin the first half of your life, and your children ruin the second half," says the mother of three women, all of whom are about to embark on motherhood for the first time.
The oldest, Cat, wants to give her boyfriend a baby. The trouble is he's had a vasectomy. Married Jessica can't conceive.  Megan gets pregnant after a one-night stand and she's considering an abortion.  Every possible dimension of conception is explored, including IVF procedures, miscarriage, post-natal depression and adoption.  Somewhat irritating, though, is the implication that all females are at the mercy of their hormones and will never experience true happiness until they have a baby.
