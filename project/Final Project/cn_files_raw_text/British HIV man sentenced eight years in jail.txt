LONDON, Nov. 3 (Xinhua) -- A British man diagnosed with HIV was sentenced eight years in jail on Monday for "coldly and callously" infecting two women with the virus.  
Mohammed Dica, a 38-year-old Londoner, was found guilty last month of two counts of causing grievous bodily harm by infecting a divorcee and a mother of two, both in their 30s.
Giving the sentence, Inner London Crown Court Judge Nicholas Philpot told Dica that his behavior had been "despicable."
"In each case you abused a loving relationship, loving on one side at any rate," said the judge.
Father-of-three Dica, who lived in southwestern London, had told police both women knew of his condition before they had sex.
But the court heard last month he persuaded one woman to have unprotected sex by claiming he had undergone a vasectomy and pursued the second victim repeatedly telling her he loved her and wanted her to have his children.
Both women face death in a decade following their relationships with Dica.
It was the first time in more than 100 years that someone had been successfully prosecuted in England and Wales for knowingly passing on a sexually transmitted disease.
