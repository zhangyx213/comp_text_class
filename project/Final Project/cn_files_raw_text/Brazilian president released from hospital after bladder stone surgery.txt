SAO PAULO, Sept. 26 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro was discharged on Saturday after undergoing an operation to remove a bladder stone at the Albert Einstein Hospital in the city of Sao Paulo, the government reported. "The president, hospitalized since Friday morning, was discharged from the hospital at 1:30 p.m. (1730 GMT) on Saturday," said hospital medical staff. The president left the medical center and boarded a plane to Brasilia, where he will spend the weekend at the presidential residence and will return to work on Monday, according to local press. Before discharge, the hospital's medical report stated that Bolsonaro is in excellent health, "with no surgical complications. He is not presenting bleeding and does not have a fever." This was the sixth operation that Bolsonaro has undergone since September 2018, when he was stabbed in the stomach at an event during his presidential campaign. Four of the operations were linked to the stabbing and the last was a vasectomy that took place in January. According to a government statement, the president is expected to participate in the launch of the Mining and Development Program on Monday at 5:00 p.m. local time (2100 GMT). Enditem
