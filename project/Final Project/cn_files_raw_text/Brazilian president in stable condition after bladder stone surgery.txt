SAO PAULO, Sept. 25 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is in stable condition after undergoing bladder stone surgery on Friday in the city of Sao Paulo, his doctors announced. According to medical staff at the Albert Einstein Hospital in Sao Paulo, the Brazilian president is "clinically stable, without fever and without pain" after the operation. "The procedure was carried out without difficulties," said one of his doctors, adding that the operation lasted an hour and a half. Doctors stated that the president underwent what is known as an endoscopic laser cystolithotripsy to extract the bladder stone. Bolsonaro has undergone several surgeries in the past several years, the first during his presidential campaign in 2018, when he was stabbed during an event in the state of Minas Gerais. Four of his surgeries were connected to the stabbing, while another at the beginning of this year was a vasectomy. Enditem
