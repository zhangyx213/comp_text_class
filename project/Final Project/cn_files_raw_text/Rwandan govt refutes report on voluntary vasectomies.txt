   Rwanda's Ministry of Health on  Sunday refuted allegations the government planned to carry out  700, 000 vasectomies to curb population growth of the tiny Central  African nation. 
    While recognizing the negative development impact of the  increased population, the Rwandan government has demonstrated  strong commitment to address the issue of very high population  density ranked among the highest in continental sub-Saharan  Africa, with over 253 persons per square km. 
    According to a press release made available to Xinhua,  Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Health Agnes Binagwaho  said, "It would be both unethical and a violation of human rights  to allocate targets to family planning options of this nature." 
    The comments came in response to allegations that 700,000 men  countrywide were "forced" to have vasectomies due to the large  birth rate. 
    "The Government of Rwanda clarified the situation with the  World Health Organization as soon as the confusion arose, so that  it is fully aware of the goals of the two initiatives and their  positive aims for Rwandans," an official statement said on Sunday.
