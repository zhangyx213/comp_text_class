RAMAJIT RAGHAV of Kharkhoda village, near Sonepat, Haryana, close to India’s capital New Delhi, became a father for the first time in 2010 when he was 94.

        Last week he became a father for the second time when his 52-year-old wife bore him a son.

        His record-breaking virility was reconfirmed Tuesday as politicians in neighboring Punjab claimed an increase in alcohol consumption and drug use was weakening the sperm count in the state. Raghav attributes his own virility to a teetotal lifestyle and a diet rich in fruit and dairy.

        “I have led a very simple life. I didn’t marry for long and followed a strict diet. I’ve taken milk, butter and fruits everyday since my childhood. We are absolutely delighted to have another member in the family. It’s a great feeling for both of us,” he said.

        Neither he nor his wife are planning any more children, and they have decided she will be sterilized rather than he undergo a vasectomy, to make sure they do not have a third.

        Indian farmer Nanu Ram Jogi, who fathered a child for at least the 21st time, at the age of 90, in 2007, was the previous world’s oldest father.
