2022 AUG 09 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Daily China News -- New research on Surgery - Vasectomy is the subject of a report. According to news reporting originating from Taiyuan, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, "To date, there is little information about the demography of vasectomy reversal (VR) patients or the factors currently influencing VR effectiveness in China, especially after the universal two-child policy was released in 2015. In this research, demographic data and perioperative medical records of VR patients were extracted from seven major hospitals in different provinces or municipalities of China." 
 Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from the First Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, "Meanwhile, a telephone survey of the patients was conducted to collect follow-up information. Eventually, 448 VR cases from the past 13 years were included. The results were analyzed by stratified comparison to investigate factors that can influence postoperative vas deferens patency and pregnancy rate. Appropriately statistical methods were used, and all of the protocols were approved by the Ethics Committees of the institutes in this research. The results showed that the annual operation volume of VR quadrupled after the two-child policy was implemented. Nonmicrosurgery and a long duration of vasectomy were significantly associated with a lower patency rate. A follow-up survey showed that the general postoperative pregnancy rate was 27.2%. For female partners over the age of 35 years, the postoperative pregnancy rate showed a more severe decline, but only 35.5% of them had been given a fertility examination before their husbands' VR surgery. Our work revealed that more patients in China have been demanding VR in recent years. High-quality microsurgery and a short duration of vasectomy are crucial for restoring patency by VR." 
 According to the news editors, the research concluded: "Clinical andrologists should perform a preoperative fertility evaluation of the patients' female partners."
