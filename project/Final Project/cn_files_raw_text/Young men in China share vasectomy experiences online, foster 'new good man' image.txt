 As gender equality gains traction, younger generation of men proud to share family, contraceptive responsibilities long endured by women   
Young men in China are sharing their vasectomy experiences on social media platforms, as a symbol of being a "new good man" and advocating that contraception should not solely be a woman's responsibility. 
Traditionally, women have borne most of the contraceptive burden, using methods such as intrauterine devices (IUDs) and birth control pills. 
About two-thirds of IUD users worldwide are in China, according to the World Health Organization.

Experts warn that the method has potential health risks such as irregular periods, uterine bleeding, and abdominal pain. 
For men, a vasectomy is a minor surgical procedure that cuts or seals the tube that carries sperm from the testes and stops it from mixing with semen. 
It is an effective form of contraception that affects neither sexual nor other physiological functions. 
However, it is often perceived as detrimental to masculinity, with some believing that a vasectomy will reduce a man's strength, despite the notion having no scientific basis. 
In China, very few men choose sterilisation. 
According to the China Health and Family Planning Statistical Yearbook, in 2020, there were a total of 14.7 million contraceptive surgeries nationwide, of which only 2,626 were male vasectomies. 
Zhao Shanchao, a urologist at China's Nanfang Hospital, said that a vasectomy can sometimes cause side effects, including incision infections and mild testicular pain. 
Nevertheless, among all contraceptive methods, vasectomy is still considered one of the safest and most effective birth control methods. 
As gender equality gains traction, more young Chinese men are opting for vasectomies and sharing their stories on social media platforms such as Xiaohongshu, Baidu, and Zhihu to support others considering the same. 
Mainland media reported that vasectomy is now seen as a sign of the "new good man". 
This refers to someone who shares family responsibilities, cares about his partner, respects women, and values equality in relationships. 
Chen, a 29-year-old who underwent a vasectomy in a hospital in Shanghai, told News Weekly that the procedure costs about 1,900 yuan (US$270), and after insurance coverage, he paid just 48 yuan (US$7). 
Another 26-year-old man who underwent a vasectomy in March wrote on Xiaohongshu. "I love my girlfriend. The recovery time for male sterilisation is shorter and less harmful to the body compared to females." 
Wang, a 30-year-old from central China said that he plans to have the procedure by the end of the year. 
Wang told the Post that both his parents and girlfriend fully support his decision. 
"Having a child is a huge burden on women. I also do not have the confidence to be a good father. If our financial situation permits in the future, we may consider adopting a child," he said. 
The topic sparked a discussion on mainland social media. 
One online observer wrote: "Thumbs up for the boyfriends and husbands who undergo vasectomy. They are brave and show respect for women." 
Another had a different view: "At the very least, sperm should be stored before vasectomy, just in case they regret it later in life and want children."
