DHAKA, Aug. 25 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh needs immediate promotion of permanent and long term methods than the temporary birth control programs to control the population, reported the official Bangladesh News Agency on Monday.
This was revealed at an opinion sharing meeting organized by Deliver Bangladesh, an organization funded by the United States Agency for International Development.
Bangladeshi State Minister for Health and Family Welfare Mizanur Rahman Sinha was quoted as saying that the total fertility rate (TFR) of this country was successfully brought down to 3.3 in 1996 from 6.3 in 1976.
The population planners at the meeting pointed out the current 140 million population size of Bangladesh, doubled from 75 millions in 1971, can be kept around 220 million by 2065 only if the family planning programs go unhampered and the TFR is brought down to 2.2 by 2010 from the current 3.3.
They, however, cautioned the situation might emerge adversely without a proper birth control policy or the contraceptives security was not ensured by 2015, when the population would reach little over 180 million and contraceptive demands would be doubled.
Nurul Hossain, Chief of Party of Deliver Bangladesh, sought strong media supports to encourage people to take sterilization ( vasectomy and ligation) instead of the popular temporary methods like oral pills.
Director General of the Family Planning Directorate Mohammad Fazlur Rahman said the government has already taken steps to popularize sterilization and 200,000 people have been targeted for this year 2003, adding the rate of the contraceptive users would also be raised to 60 percent from the existing level of 54 percent.
According to official sources, Bangladesh bought 219 million condoms, 112 million pills, 10 million injections and 0.2 million intrauterine devices as temporary products to control births last year.
The family planning programme was formally launched in the country in 1962, but it began to take momentum in the late seventies.
