   Brazilian President Luiz  Inacio Lula da Silva announced on Monday the National Family  Planning Policy in an effort to make the family planning  information and birth control methods available to all the people.
     According to the policy, the government will invest 50 million  U.S dollars and distribute 50 million boxes acontaining  contraceptive pills and injections.
    The government also advocates vasectomy, describing it as a  15-minute medical procedure that does not require absence from  work.
    Lula stressed that the program aims to protect life, allowing  those in need to take care of themselves.
    Health Minister Jose Gomes Temporao, who accompanied the  president in the ceremony to announce the program, said the  government is not worried about an eventual rejection of the  contraceptive methods from such groups as the Catholics.
