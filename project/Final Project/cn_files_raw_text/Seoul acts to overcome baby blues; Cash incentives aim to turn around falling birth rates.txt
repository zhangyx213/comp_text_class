 The South Korean government has told people to go forth and multiply, and has put its money where its mouth is.
 The Ministry of Health and Welfare has unveiled a proposal to try to stem the country's plunging birth rate, including financial incentives for families that have more than one child.
 Just one generation ago, the government was exhorting South Koreans to have fewer offspring with offers such as free vasectomies and tax breaks for families with fewer children.
A possible reflection of the success of that programme is the sharp reversal in policy now being implemented.
 Presenting the proposals to acting President Goh Kun, Health Minister Kim Hwa-joong suggested the government pay half the cost of childbirth for a second child and all the expenses for subsequent children.
 South Korean women average 1.17 babies each, according to the country's National Statistical office. A rate of about 2.1 is needed to maintain the population.
 Officials fear the dramatic fall in the birth rate will have severe repercussions for economic growth, with a smaller labour pool and fewer workers to support the elderly.
 The fall in the country's birth rate goes hand in hand with the changing role of women in society.
 South Korean women are now marrying later and choosing to have fewer children. Many are postponing starting a family, fearing they could face pressure to give up their jobs when they become mothers.
 The lack of quality, affordable childcare is also a major reason for not having more children.
 Most pre-school day centres are privately run, leaving many women to rely on relatives to look after their children.
 Lee Ju-yong, 37, already has two children, aged five and eight.
 "I only managed to raise two children because I had a job and because my mother and mother-in-law helped me look after the children," said Ms Ju-yong, who has decided against having any more children.
 Parents cite the expense of educating children in a highly pressured society as a further reason for choosing to remain childless or for their decision to have fewer children than in the past.
 Women's groups have criticised the government for failing to come up with comprehensive, fundamental proposals to improve the role of women in society and make it easier for them to combine work and bringing up children.
 A scholar in women's studies, Park Hy-ran, noted in a recent newspaper column: "To young women today, both marriage and childbirth are merely options. They do not have babies, not because they are selfish, but because they are wise."
