A study released Tuesday said sterilization had become the number one form of contraception in the United States, surpassing even the Pill in popularity.
The study, conducted by researchers led by Dr. Carolyn Westhoff and Dr. Anne Davis of Columbia University, reported that 11 million women, or 18 percent, rely on either their partner's vasectomy or their own sterilization -- a figure that surprised the researchers.
WORLD NEWS; OTHERSEven more surprising, a third of these women are not married.
That compares to about 10 percent of women who currently use the birth control pill, the researchers reported their findings in the journal Fertility and Sterility.
One of the main reasons behind the phenomenon, according to Westhoff and Davis, is that women had been worried about the health effects of the Pill.
In a second report in the same journal, Larry Bumpass and colleagues at the University of Wisconsin said they found that one- third of all recent tubal sterilization were performed on unmarried women.
"Sterilization while unmarried is remarkably common among all race or ethnic groups," the Wisconsin team wrote in their report.
They were also surprised to find that women are opting to have their tubes tied rather than relying on their partner's vasectomy, even though vasectomy is cheaper, quicker and safer.
The researchers noted that a third of all births now occur outside marriage in the United States, in part because women are delaying marriage.
Nearly 11,000 women aged 15 to 44 were interviewed at length for the survey, conducted through the National Survey of Family Growth.
In an unrelated study published Tuesday, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said it found 10 percent of the 750 women aged 18 or over surveyed by Gallup said they currently used the pill.
