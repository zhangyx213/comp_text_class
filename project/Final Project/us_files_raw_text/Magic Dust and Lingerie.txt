In talking with Washingtonian.com, Dan Steinberg of the Washington Post's DC Sports Bog picked his favorites among sports personalities.
Jim Zorn or Joe Gibbs?
At his press conferences, Joe Gibbs did nothing but talk about guts, heart, the expending of guts, the display of heart, and the core values of the Washington Redskins. Jim Zorn talks about magic dust and how he used to take ice-dancing lessons. So Zorn, in a rout.
Clinton Portis or Alex Ovechkin?
Portis provides sublime humor, from his costumes to his birthday parties to his insistence that one of his teammates had a vasectomy last year. But Ovechkin is also pretty funny, has done amazing work on Russian-language sketch shows, gets his hair done at the Hair Cuttery, and happens to be the best hockey player in the world. So Ovechkin, narrowly.
Chris Cooley or Ryan Zimmerman?
I mean, no offense to the dude, but read Zim's blog. Here's a recent sample: "Football is upon us. This is my favorite time of the year. Football is easily my favorite sport." That's an A-plus, Ryan. Your next assignment is to tell us what you want to be when you grow up. . . .
Cooley, on the other hand, posts pictures of his cheerleading wife in lingerie on his blog, provides the most detailed description of an NFL drug test you could ever want, and wrote a guest post for the legendary sports blog Kissing Suzy Kolber in which he described the NFL training camp as "F-k Town."
