A bill introduced Thursday in Alabama's House of Representative would require men in the state to undergo vasectomies once they turn 50 years old or father three children, "whichever comes first."
The bill, authored by Rep. Rolanda Hollis, D-Birmingham, would also require men to pay for the procedure themselves.
 "Under existing law, there are no restrictions on the reproductive rights of men," according to the text of the bill.
 Hollis told AL.com the legislation was in response to the bill passed last year by Alabama legislators which would have nearly banned abortion in the state. A federal judge in October blocked the law, which would have made performing an abortion a felony in almost all cases.
 "It always takes two to tango," she told AL.com. "We can't put all the responsibility on women. Men need to be responsible also."
 In response to questions on Twitter, Hollis said the bill would "help prevent pregnancy as well as abortion of unwanted children."
 "This bill is to help men become more accountable as well as women," she wrote.
 The bill, H.B. 238, was referred to the House Judiciary Committee, Yellowhammer News reported.
