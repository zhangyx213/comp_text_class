Hilbrecht v. Greco M.D.
CA 19-01179
Appealed from Supreme Court, Niagara County
Background: The plaintiffs commenced a medical malpractice action alleging that the defendant negligently performed two vasectomy procedures causing the plaintiff to sustain injuries. The defendants appealed from the denial of their motion for summary judgement.
Ruling: The Appellate Division affirmed. The court held that the plaintiffs had raised triable issues of fact. In making this holding the court rejected the argument that the plaintiff’s anonymous expert failed to offer an adequate foundation for his qualifications. The expert indicated that he was a licensed physician and board certified in urology, as well as a fellow at that American College of Surgeons, and a former chief of urology.
