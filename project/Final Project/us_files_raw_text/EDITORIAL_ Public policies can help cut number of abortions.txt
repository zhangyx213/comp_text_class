Apr. 6--More people are seeking abortions and vasectomies because they don't think they can afford babies, according to physicians quoted by The Associated Press.
A New York doctor described a married couple with two children who chose abortion because they figured a birth would have cost at least $30,000.
The husband was self-employed, and they could afford only low-cost health insurance without maternity benefits.
Not everybody makes that choice. Brooke Holycross, 25, of Port Orange, Fla., decided against aborting her fourth child after seeing a sonogram of the 15-week-old fetus. But her common-law husband has been laid off, and "we're scared," she said.
Ideally, no one would get pregnant unintentionally and no one would need an abortion. All parents would have or find the resources to keep children healthy and raise them well.
But it's naive to think that will happen without public policies that give people responsible options. Access to reasonably priced health care, including birth control, is necessary if we really want to cut down on the number of abortions.
