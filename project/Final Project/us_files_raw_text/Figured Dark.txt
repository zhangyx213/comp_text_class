Rappleye, Greg. Figured Dark. Univ. of Arkansas . 2007. c.70p. ISBN 978-1-55728-852-3 . pap. $16. POETRY
"My vasectomy, for instance./I choose a woman doctor, admiring William the Conqueror/ and his great French broadsword,/but frankly, preferring the glories/of the Bayeux Tapestry;/the art of the women's stitch work-/the terra-cotta and blue-green threads, the olive and the goldenrod." Whether it is because of their sharp details, their incredible and unexpected imagery, or simply their curious intentions, Rappleye's (Holding Down the Earth ) poems are a delight. Smart allusions bring together the voices of such diverse figures as musician Brian Wilson and Odysseus. There is an homage to a rainy afternoon spent in New York City's legendary Gotham Book Mart, an investigation into the case of a woman who spontaneously burst into flames, and a celebration of the hard work of hacking into a blackberry thicket: "thorns of a thousand brambles/stipple and rip my skin..../I'm making a new path-/tired of the scumble of weeds,/ sick of nightshade and understory." With a wonderful voice and an instinctual sense of language, Rappleye is an old-fashioned storyteller, a creator of brilliant lies, myths, and histories. There is a tremendous amount of wisdom, wit, and imagination here. Highly recommended.-Louis McKee, Painted Bride Arts Ctr., Philadelphia
