 Laguna Hills, CA -- (ReleaseWire[1]) -- 10/20/2014 -- Vasectomy Reversal USA[2] is part of the practice owned by Dr. Aaron Spitz, a world-famous fertility doctor practicing out of Orange County Urology Associates Inc. in California. His Vasectomy Reversal clinic is offering vasectomy reversals for San Diego[3], California and surrounding areas. 

A Vasectomy is the dividing and scarring of the Vas Deferens, the tube that connects the urethra with the testicles. It is performed as a form of male birth control, in order to enjoy sex more with a significant other without the threat of an unwanted pregnancy. 

Some people may eventually wish to reverse this process in order to start a family and take their relationships to the next level. Dr. Spitz understands this and provides microsurgical vasectomy reversal procedures that restore the original continuity of the vas deferens and restores sperm to the semen.

The Vasectomy Reversal procedure is performed with general anesthesia, ensuring patients are not conscious for the procedure. The surgeon then makes a small incision near the patient's vasectomy scar and brings the scar into view. Then a surgical microscope is used to magnify the vas deferens and the scar tissue is bypassed. Fluid is then sampled from the newly exposed vas deferens to confirm the presence of sperm. If no sperm is found then a bypass is made into the epididymis where sperm are stored after they are produced in the testicle.

The freshly cut areas of the vas deferens are then ready to connect; they are brought close together and then stitched together in two layers with micro-sutures less than the thickness of an eyelash. Before completing the connection, the Vas Deferens is flushed to ensure an uninterrupted flow to the urethra. The actual channel running through the vas deferens is about a third of a millimeter wide. Therefore, the procedure needs careful attention and requires a knowledgeable surgeon. Sperm can be harvested and frozen at the time of the vasectomy reversal.

Local anesthetic is applied to the area so upon awakening the patient has no pain for several hours. 

Vasectomy reversals can strengthen and reinforce marriages with a revitalized sex life and the promise of a new family.
