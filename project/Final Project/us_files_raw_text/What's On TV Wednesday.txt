8 P.M. (Starz Cinema) CAPOTE (2005) Philip Seymour Hoffman, above, won an Oscar for his embodiment of Truman Capote as he uncovers the story that became ''In Cold Blood,'' the novel about the 1959 murder of the Clutter family in Holcomb, Kan., in this drama directed by Bennett Miller from a script by Dan Futterman. Catherine Keener plays Nelle Harper Lee, Capote's research assistant; Chris Cooper is Alvin Dewey, the lead investigator on the case; and Clifton Collins Jr. is the murderer Perry Smith. Writing in The New York Times, A. O. Scott called the film ''a fascinating and fine-grained reconstruction of that period in its subject's life, a time when he pursued literary glory and flirted with moral ruin.''
