Jordan Barry Attendees listen to speaker Molly Monk during "Talking Bodies", a Reinvention of the Vagina Monologues at the Greenhouse in Iowa City on Sunday, Nov. 3, 2024. The event was organized by Medical Students for Choice.
On a rainy Sunday night, people packed into The Green House cocktail lounge to affirm their beliefs about reproductive health care in Iowa.
Medical Students for Choice, a national organization with a chapter of students from the Carver College of Medicine hosted a fundraiser for the Emma Goldman Clinic.
Medical Students for Choice is a national organization that works to educate and train medical students on abortion, reproductive, and sexual health care that they might not receive in their formal education.
Education and outreach are at the core of what the organization does. From vasectomy and IUD training to vacuum abortion training, the group explores many parts of reproductive health.
Annie Galloway, a third-year medical student and member of Medical Students for Choice, explained that the goal of the organization is purely educating medical students, who will tackle the medical field as doctors one day.
"We want to make sure that students are educated on how to provide equitable, patient-centered, holistic care to everyone who needs it. We [Medical Students for Choice] spread that awareness and that education to medical students, because it's not always a part of our curriculum," Galloway said.
Emma Goldman, according to the clinic's website, is a feminist-focused reproductive care clinic. Originally started in 1973 after Roe v. Wade became law of the land, the clinic, located on Dubuque Street, has been a part of the Iowa City community for over 50 years.
The event titled "Talking Bodies: A Reinvention of the Vagina Monologues" focused on raising money for the Emma Goldman Clinic. Tickets were $10, and $1 from each purchase of the special cocktail "The Angry Vagina," created for the event, also went to the clinic. A total of $1,138 was raised.
"[Emma Goldman] depends on donations to keep its doors open, especially now with a six-week ban," Galloway said.
The six-week abortion ban took effect in the state in July of this year. The ban prohibits abortions after cardiac activity can be detected. With laws like this being implemented across America, reproductive rights have become an issue many voters across the country will look to on election day.
Many people at the event were there to show their support not only for the clinic but also to be around like-minded people with a monumental election on the horizon.
"No bones about it, abortion and reproductive health care is on the ballot, and it's of critical importance, especially in the last couple of years, how those rights have been put in jeopardy, especially in a state like Iowa," Jane Jozefowicz said. "It was really important for me to find a community here that shares my values regarding those issues and who are working to promote reproductive freedom."

Jozefowicz, alongside Kathryn Linehan, is a law student at the University of Iowa College of Law and a part of Lawyering for Reproductive Justice, an organization of law students that aims to raise awareness for reproductive rights.
Jozefowicz and Linehan were at the event to show support for the clinic and for Medical Students for Choice.
"It is important to support organizations, or long-standing communities who are already doing this work. It's a good reminder that there are like-minded people near you in your community," Linehan said.
The event was filled with people from all backgrounds coming together to support Emma Goldman and reproductive freedom as a whole.
"It feels so refreshing to be in a space that's filled with people who share the same passion for reproductive justice. It gives me energy and it gives me hope, and it's just so relaxing to be in such a safe space that is so safe psychologically," Galloway said.
The event featured readings of monologues, some from the play "The Vagina Monologues" while others were original pieces.
Lina-Maria Murrillo, UI assistant professor in gender, women's and sexuality studies and history was also in attendance and gave an empowering speech before the readings started.
"This is a very stressful time, especially for those of us who care about reproductive justice - who care about justice - this is a really, really, really stressful time," Murrillo said to the crowd during the event. "It was beautiful that you all thought to do something like this on the eve of a very emotional and very consequential election."
