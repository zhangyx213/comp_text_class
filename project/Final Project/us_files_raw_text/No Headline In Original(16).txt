IN THE SPOTLIGHT
 * Home Run Derby: 8 p.m. today, Miller Park, Milwaukee. TV: ESPN. Brewers 1B Richie Sexson will replace Dodgers OF Shawn Green in the Home Run Derby. Green, who ranked third in the National League with 26 homers, dropped out of the contest because of a sore wrist.
 NEWS & NOTES
 * The Red Sox announced plans for a celebration of Ted Williams' life even as his family fought over what to do with his remains. Bobby Jo Ferrell, Williams' daughter from his first wife, said she will seek a court injunction today to stop her half brother, John Henry Williams, from trying to have their father's body or DNA frozen. The Red Sox will have a memorial service for Ted Williams July 22 at Fenway Park. Fans will be able to attend for free in the afternoon and in a ticketed event that night, with the proceeds going to Williams' favorite charity, The Jimmy Fund.
* Diamonbacks LHP Randy Johnson backed out of the All-Star Game, opting to spend the break with his family instead of pitching for the National League. Braves LHP Mike Remlinger was picked as Johnson's replacement. Giants closer Robb Nen (23 saves) and Phillies RHP Vicente Padilla (10-5, 3.05 ERA) were added to the NL team as injury replacements. Nen and Padilla will replace Braves LHP Tom Glavine and Cardinals RHP Matt Morris.
 * Frank Thomas, unhappy with being benched, showed up late and missed the White Sox's pregame stretch. Out of the lineup for the third game in a row, Thomas got to the clubhouse about two hours before the game but not in time for warmup exercises. On Saturday, he was angered when Manager Jerry Manuel didn't tell him he would be sitting out. Thomas is hitting .239 and is in an 0-for-16 slump.
 * Mets C Mike Piazza was scratched from the lineup because of back spasms. Mets GM Steve Phillips said Piazza should be able to start the All-Star Game tomorrow night.
 * Marlins SS Alex Gonzalez was taken to a hospital for tests after he woke up with stomach pains.
 * Cubs OF Sammy Sosa missed his third consecutive game because of a family emergency but still plans to play in the All-Star Game. A Cubs spokesman said Sosa's wife injured her hand in a household accident and was scheduled to have surgery today.
 * The Athletics made room on their roster for the newly acquired LHP Ted Lilly by optioning RHP Mike Fyhrie to Class AAA Sacramento. Lilly replaces Aaron Harang in the rotation. Harang moves to the bullpen.
 HE SAID IT
 * Curt Schilling, Diamondbacks pitcher, on the effects another baseball strike would have on fans: "If something were to happen and there would be a work stoppage, in our careers the game would never be the same. I'm 35 years old. I want to play five or six more years. I don't want to play five or six more years in front of 7,000 people."
 THE FINAL PITCH
 * Nobody will watch the Charleston Riverdogs' game against the Columbus Redstixx in Charleston, S.C., tonight. And that's just what the team wants. The Riverdogs will padlock the gates and hold a party, including discounted food and beer, outside the ballpark in an attempt to set the record for the lowest attendance at a professional baseball game on "Nobody Night." Fans will be permitted into Joe Riley Stadium after the game is declared official after five innings. Team owner and promotional guru Mike Veeck has a long history of outlandish promotions, including "Vasectomy Night" -- canceled at the last minute -- and "Tonya Harding Bat Day."
 "Even though it's so goofy and it's so out there, I think [our fans] have a capacity along with us now, after kind of a relationship that's been built, to kind of laugh and say 'Gosh, that's stupid' -- which it is," Veeck said.
