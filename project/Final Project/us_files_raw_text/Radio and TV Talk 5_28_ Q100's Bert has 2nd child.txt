Q100's morning host Bert Weiss sent out a mass message announcing his second child, another son:
Stacey delivered our second son on Friday night. Hollis Lee Weiss was born 6 pounds and 7 oz. He was born 4 1/2 weeks early and hadA some very minor complications which kept him in the hospital. We're thinking he should be home later today.
I had a vasectomy scheduled even before he was born for THIS Thursday afternoon. If I can find something really sharp around the house I just might do it myself today.
