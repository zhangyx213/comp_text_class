May 13, 2016( Wall St. Cheat Sheet: / Delivered by Newstex) A doctor | Source: iStock It's common knowledge that the majority of people hate going to the doctor[1]. Many write off symptoms as nothing, hoping they'll never get sick. Yet, there are some doctors that the majority of American men should be seeing, even if it's only once a year. Making sure you are keeping yourself in optimum health, especially as you age, will prepare you for a long and healthy life. 
Preventative health services are often not required, which is why you should put it in your own hands to make it a priority. Getting a physical every year is the least you can do to ensure optimum health. Ask your doctor if it's worth it to see the below list of doctors, as well as any other doctors he recommends based on your lifestyle, current health status,and medical history. If you have a close relative that is suffering or has died from a disease, be sure to see the doctor that specializes in that specific condition.1. UrologistThis is especially crucial for men over the age of 40. A urologist can help with more than just prostate cancer[2], seeing a urologist will help men take charge of their prostate, urinary, and sexual health. Urologists are experts in managing urinary and sexual health, and as you get older, quality-of-life plays an important role. They will tell you which symptoms you should think twice about and which don't indicate poor health. Urologists will also help you with conditions like an enlarged prostate, erectile dysfunction[3], or a vasectomy. Be sure to stay up to date with prostate and cancer screenings as well.2. DermatologistSee a dermatologist once a year, especially if you are often exposed to the sun[4]. These doctors will help protect your skin from sun damage, help you control your acne, and check out any moles and freckles that have changed over time - even over the course of one year. Each year, 5.4 million cases of non-melanoma skin cancer[5] are diagnosed. Many forms are symptomless and require the eyes of an expert. In addition, men between he ages of 15 and 39 are 55% more likely to die from melanoma[6] than women. 3. ProctologistA stethoscope at a doctor's office | Source: Thinkstock Getting a colonoscopy is never fun, but it can seriously help you in the long run. If your relative was diagnosed with colon cancer, or any other colon diseases, begin screening at the age of 40[7]. Otherwise, if you're at an average risk, start screening at the age of 50. It doesn't hurt to get them earlier, some studies suggest[8]. Doctors suggest getting colonoscopies every five to 10 years, but many men get them done more frequently to be extra safe.4. Cholesterol checkMen should start getting their cholesterol checked every five years at the age of 35[9]. Others suggest getting cholesterol checked during your yearly physical exam[10], or even three to four times a year if you are at a higher risk. Your doctor should ultimately guide you as to when you must get your cholesterol checked[11] because it is primarily based on your general lifestyle, food choices, other current health conditions, and your medical history. It is worthwhile to bring up to your general doctor during your yearly exam. 5. Optometrist Eye doctor | Source: Thinkstock Unless you wear contacts or glasses, getting an eye exam isn't on the top of your doctor's list every year. But eye doctors recommend that you come in every one to two years[12], with or without corrective lenses (but more often if you do!) You should come in every one to two years if anyone in your family has a history of glaucoma, macular degeneration, diabetes, high blood pressure, eye injuries, or having eye surgery, or you have a visually demanding job that poses a hazard to your eyes (such as working in a factory).More from Health ...tness Cheat Sheet:The Guy's 14-Day Countdown to Valentine's Day[13] The Signs She Only Wants You for Your Money[14] 6 Secrets Your Should Never Keep in a Relationship[15] Read the original article from The Cheat Sheet[16] [ 1]:  [ 2]:             [ 3]:             [ 4]:             [ 5]:             [ 6]:             [ 7]:             [ 8]:             [ 9]:             [ 10]:             [ 11]:             [ 12]:             [ 13]:             [ 14]:             [ 15]:             [ 16]:
