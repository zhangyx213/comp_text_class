Former North Carolina senator John Edwards' name has popped up in an investigation into an alleged prostitution scheme run by the so-called "Millionaire Madam," Anna Gristina.

Reports Manhattan-centric news site DNAinfo:
According to "On The Inside" sources, Edwards allegedly hooked up with one of Gristina's high-end hookers in 2007 when the dashing pol from North Carolina brought his then high-flying presidential campaign to the Big Apple.
The one-night fling allegedly took place at an Upper East Side hotel suite and was arranged by an aide with help from a New Yorker familiar with Gristina's prostitution ring, sources said.
Indeed, records show that Edwards' presidential campaign paid for frequent stays at the Park Avenue's Loews Hotels Regency, among other hotels, back in 2007. 
If that hotel name rings a bell, it may be because it's also where Edwards is said to have met his former campaign videographer Rielle Hunter, with whom Edwards had a child as a result of his extra-marital affair.
