Scottdale, Pa.
He wasn't 'playing ninja'
A western Pennsylvania man denies he was outside running around pretending to be a ninja, but acknowledges he did leave his 4-year-old son home alone sleeping while he went jogging earlier this month.
Twenty-eight-year-old Ross Hurst remains in the Westmoreland County Prison after his preliminary hearing on a child endangerment charge was postponed Wednesday. Outside the courtroom, Hurst told reporters that he wasn't pretending to be a ninja when Scottdale police charged him March 3 at about 1:30 a.m.
Hurst says he simply "went for a jog" - but acknowledges he shouldn't have left his son alone.
But police insist Hurst was dressed all in black and "playing ninja" when they confronted him. They say Hurst claimed his mother was babysitting, but she told police she wasn't.
West Des Moines, Iowa
A good time for the snip
A West Des Moines clinic's ad campaign hits below the belt by urging sport fans to indulge in some alternative March madness: Have a vasectomy, then spend the weekend recovering while watching NCAA tournament basketball.
Iowa Clinic marketing executive Jessica Grant says that the campaign is designed to appeal to men whose partners want them to get the snip and who complain they spend too much time in front of the TV.
The ad reads, "After your vasectomy: Stay on couch. 32 games in two days. Return to work on Monday."
Urologist Dr. Mark Kellerman says he thinks the campaign is "a great idea."
The clinic performed 102 vasectomies in March 2010, when the ads debuted. This month, 129 are scheduled.
