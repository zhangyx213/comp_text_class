<b>THIS DATE IN SLICE HISTORY</b>
 Slice-meister Paul Turner is taking some time off this month, but don't despair: In his absence, we're rerunning some of the tastier tidbits from this date in Slice history. Today's sampling:
<b>FROM 2005:</b>
 Everybody knows about farmer tans.
 But what sort of color pattern do light-skinned people in your profession tend to acquire during the summer?
 Accountant tans? Barista tans?
<b>FROM 1999:</b>
 Family milestone: "You asked awhile ago what event would make this summer memorable," wrote a reader we'll call Em. "I'd have to say it would be that my husband had his vasectomy the Friday before Father's Day and (for Father's Day) the kids and I gave him a bicycle."
<b>FROM 1998:</b>
 Agree or disagree: Those who grew up in the Inland Northwest tend to have quieter speaking voices than people who moved here as adults.
<b>FROM 1996:</b>
 We still wonder.
 Did people who came here in response to that slogan of a few years ago - "Spokane, you'll love it here" - decide after coming that they did, in fact, love it here?
