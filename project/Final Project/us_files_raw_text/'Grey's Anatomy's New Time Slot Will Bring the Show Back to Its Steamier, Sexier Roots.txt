When ABC's critically acclaimed series, Grey's Anatomy, returns for its 16th midseason premiere in January, it will be at 9 p.m. instead of 8 p.m. However, fans who are dying to know what happens afterthat car crashed into Joe's bar[4]will have to tune into Station 19 at 8 p.m. first.Station 19 is the second spin-off to Grey's Anatomy and is coming into its third season. The first spin-off was Private Practice, which ran for six seasons and garnished critical acclaim.The firefighters from Seattle Fire Station 19 will arrive on the scene of the crash to work on rescuing those trapped inside the underground bar. Then, when 9 p.m. hits, the rescue will continue on Grey's Anatomy. Characters from both shows will appear throughout the two-hour-long season premiere. View this post on Instagram  CAN. NOT. WAIT. The Epic #GreysxStation19 Crossover event Thursday, January 23rd starting 8|7c on ABC.[5] A post shared by Grey's Anatomy Official[6] (@greysabc) on Nov 21, 2019 at 9:00pm PST 'Ever since Station 19 premiered,'Vernoff told Deadline[7], 'in the writers' room, we always thought the better progression was from firefighters to the hospital.' She continued, 'I didn't think it was going to happen, but I was thrilled ABC had made the decision. I literally cheered when they let me know that. It's really exciting and opens up the storytelling.' 'Grey's Anatomy's move from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. has significant ramifications  The flagship series initially aired at 9 p.m., so Vernoff is very excited that it will be able to return to its roots. There are very different guidelines for shows that air before 9 p.m. The earlier slots are considered family programming, so they are limited in what they show.'There are different rules for a 9 p.m. show than there are for an 8 p.m. show, Vernoff commented, 'and we hope to take advantage of those rules.''Grey's was definitely allowed to be a sexier show when it was on at 9 o'clock. So we are excited by the change back to our original [Thursday] time slot,' she added.

'Unsuitable material can include everything from sexual content to violence, graphic or distressing imagery, and swearing.'Therefore, we are about to see a move towards more sex scenes that involve more than kissing. There may be more nudity and graphic death scenes, as well. What kinds of scenes did 'Grey's Anatomy' show when they were at the later time slot?  Grey's Anatomy initially aired at 10 p.m. on Sunday nights for its first season. Subsequent seasons were at the coveted 9 p.m. Thursday night slot through the tenth season.During those early ten seasons, Grey's Anatomy was known for an abundance of steamy sex scenes. The season 16 fall finale included a few make-out sessions, but everyone was fully dressed. In the early days of the show, it was not uncommon for the show to open with two people naked in bed together. View this post on Instagram             "There's a reason it's a difficult decision. You just have to decide if it's all worth it." #GreysAnatomy[11] A post shared by Grey's Anatomy Official[12] (@greysabc) on Nov 15, 2019 at 8:00am PST The Izzie (Catherine Heigl) and Alex (Just Chambers), 'take off your pants,' sex scene is one of thetop ten steamiest ever[13]. By the end of the scene, they have taken off almost all of their clothing and are having sex in an on-call room.Then there was the time that Meredith (Ellen Pompeo) and McDreamy (Patrick Dempsey) had sex in a medical exam room. We watch as Derek gently takes off Meredith's stockings. There is an endless amount of skin, rubbing, and kissing.It looks like Grey's Anatomy is about to get back to its sexy roots, and Vernoff isn't the only one excited about it. We can't wait to see what she has in store when the show returns to ABC on Jan. 23, 2020.
