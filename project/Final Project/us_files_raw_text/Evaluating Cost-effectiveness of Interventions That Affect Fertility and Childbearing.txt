ABSTRACT
Background. Current guidelines for economic evaluations of health interventions define relevant outcomes as those accruing to individuals receiving interventions. Little consensus exists on counting health impacts on current and future fertility and childbearing. Our objective was to characterize current practices for counting such health outcomes. Methods. We developed a framework characterizing health interventions with direct and/or indirect effects on fertility and childbearing and how such outcomes are reported. We identified interventions spanning the framework and performed a targeted literature review for economic evaluations of these interventions. For each article, we characterized how the potential health outcomes from each intervention were considered, focusing on quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with fertility and childbearing. Results. We reviewed 108 studies, identifying 7 themes: 1) Studies were heterogeneous in reporting outcomes. 2) Studies often selected outcomes for inclusion that tend to bias toward finding the intervention to be cost-effective. 3) Studies often avoided the challenges of assigning QALYs for pregnancy and fertility by instead considering cost per intermediate outcome. 4) Even for the same intervention, studies took heterogeneous approaches to outcome evaluation. 5) Studies used multiple, competing rationales for whether and how to include fertility-related QALYs and whose QALYs to include. 6) Studies examining interventions with indirect effects on fertility typically ignored such QALYs. 7) Even recent studies had these shortcomings. Limitations include that the review was targeted rather than systematic. Conclusions. Economic evaluations inconsistently consider QALYs from current and future fertility and childbearing in ways that frequently appear biased toward the interventions considered. As the Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine updates its guidelines, making the practice of cost-effectiveness analysis more consistent is a priority. Our study contributes to harmonizing methods in this respect.
FULL TEXT
Whose health benefits should be counted in economic evaluations (i.e., cost-effectiveness analyses [CEAs] or cost-benefit analyses [CBAs]) of interventions that directly or indirectly affect current and future fertility and childbearing? Consider the example of in vitro fertilization (IVF). If a woman receives IVF and gives birth to a healthy child, should quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained by the mother and child be counted? Should fewer QALYs be assigned if the child born has cystic fibrosis (CF)? Are QALYs lost if, instead, the woman who has had IVF then has fetal genetic testing and chooses to abort the fetus with CF? Are QALYs lost or gained if a young woman diagnosed with cancer has a hysterectomy and becomes infertile? What if her partner is treated for testicular cancer and becomes infertile?
Such questions raise thorny and contentious issues. Yet, analysts conducting economic evaluations must answer these questions explicitly or implicitly. For interventions that have direct or indirect effects on fertility and childbearing, choices about whose health benefits to count can strongly influence conclusions about which interventions to invest in. Furthermore, the particular nature of such decision problems—for example, infertility treatment of a couple in which the male partner’s preferences are frequently relevant—make consideration of these questions distinctly challenging. For such interventions, it is important to conceptualize both whose benefits to quantify and how to do so.
Current guidelines for conducting economic evaluations of health interventions define relevant health outcomes primarily as changes in the quantity and quality of life for individuals receiving interventions.1–3 However, strikingly little consensus guidance exists on whether and how to count the health impacts of interventions that affect current and future fertility and childbearing, despite the increasing use of technologies that directly or indirectly have such impacts. Literatures as diverse as welfare economics, law, and ethics have grappled with these fundamental challenges. In each area, debate remains, suggesting that applied economic evaluations are unlikely to take a uniform, consistent approach.4–14
Our paper is not intended to resolve these debates but rather to probe important questions in the context of the current update15 to the guidelines contained in Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine.2 To inform this discussion, we developed a framework describing situations in which these considerations are relevant. Then we conducted a targeted literature review of economic evaluations of interventions where fertility and reproductive issues are at the forefront. Our goal was to identify the range of practices in counting health benefits and harms of interventions in such analyses. Our review is targeted rather than systematic and is intended to highlight the state of research in this area and to identify inconsistencies that may bias results, highlighting the need for harmonized guidance.
Methods
We developed a framework describing interventions that have direct and/or indirect effects on fertility and childbearing. We distinguished interventions by the situation (women with a current pregnancy, women with a future pregnancy, or men at any time), effect on fertility and childbearing (increases or decreases in fertility, pregnancies ending before birth, or birth defects/perinatally acquired disease/preterm birth and newborn complications), and whether effects are intended or unintended (i.e., side effects). For example, contraception has the intended effect of decreasing a woman’s fertility, whereas radiation treatments can have the unintended effect of decreasing a woman’s fertility. For some possible combinations, no interventions are relevant: For example, no interventions intend to increase birth defects.
We next identified a set of health interventions that span the framework. These include interventions that affect a woman’s current pregnancy (e.g., preeclampsia screening and treatment, prenatal genetic testing) and interventions that affect a woman’s fertility (e.g., IVF and assisted reproductive technologies, contraception). We also identified interventions that affect a man’s fertility (e.g., vasectomy, vasectomy reversal, and radiation treatments). The set of interventions is not meant to be exhaustive but rather to collectively cover all logically consistent combinations in the framework.
We then developed a framework to characterize how such studies quantify outcomes. For the child, mother, and father, we determined whether a study reported intended and unintended outcomes separately, combined as QALYs or disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), monetized for CBA, or not at all. For reported outcomes, we determined the time horizon over which the outcomes were measured (through gestation/childbirth, lifetime, or other).
We performed a targeted (rather than systematic) literature review, searching for articles presenting economic evaluations of the selected interventions. We searched in high-impact general medical journals and journals whose focus is on obstetrics and gynecology or other issues related to fertility and childbearing. For each article, we identified which health outcomes were considered, with particular focus on QALY gains and losses associated with current and future fertility and childbearing.
Finally, we performed quantitative analyses (descriptive statistics and assessment of statistical differences using Fisher exact tests and logistic regressions as appropriate) and qualitative analyses of the selected articles to identify key patterns, with specific focus on consistency across intervention types.
Results
 Table 1 shows our framework and intervention examples that fit within it. Table 2 presents our framework for how health outcomes in the studies are measured and reported. From our literature review, we selected 108 studies for analysis that covered interventions spanning the logically feasible combinations in our framework. Table 3 summarizes groups of articles by intervention type. Table 4 provides information about each study we reviewed. Below, we provide quantitative and qualitative characterizations of key themes identified in the review.

a.
The category “Pregnancy Ends before Birth” includes both miscarriage of pregnancies whose desired outcome is birth and those whose desired outcome is termination of the embryo/fetus. The category assumes that health care is provided to women who know they are pregnant and considers the fetus that the woman is currently carrying.
b.
The category “Birth Defects/Perinatally Acquired Disease/Preterm Birth and Newborn Complications” is intended to reflect outcomes that occur among infants alive at the time of birth including higher subsequent risks from prematurity. Additionally, a wide range of interventions delivered during labor and delivery (e.g., caesarean section, operative vaginal delivery, fetal heart monitoring, and elective induction of labor) are also part of this category as they are intended to prevent adverse outcomes resulting from the delivery process to the newborn and/or mother.
c.
“Genetic testing” when conducted during pregnancy encompasses a complex set of activities that are frequently performed sequentially depending on the outcomes of those performed previously. Hence, the relevant outcomes from each step of the testing and consequent intervention decisions based on results may be difficult to specify for all activities here. For example, in addition to serum screening for chromosomal abnormalities, chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis can be used to collect material from amniotic fluid for testing. These latter collection mechanisms present unintended miscarriage risks.

Overview of Studies Selected for Review
*| Intervention | Summary of Reviewed Articles | 
*| Treatment of chlamydia among women and men | 8 articles.54–61 Infertility and ectopic pregnancy included as a loss of maternal QALYs. QALY gains for infants born if they avoid health harms. Male QALYs gained due to chlamydia treatment; no male QALY losses for fetal loss or caring for sick child. | 
*| Antiretroviral therapy for HIV-infected pregnant women | 6 articles.62–67 Infant QALYs gained (DALYs averted) due to avoiding HIV infection. No maternal QALYs gained due to child avoiding HIV infection. | 
*| Contraception for HIV-infected pregnant women | 2 articles.75,76 One study considers births averted; one considers HIV-infected births averted. Neither considers antiretroviral therapy to attenuate newborn HIV infection or benefits to mother of ongoing treatment or of having a child without HIV. | 
*| Therapeutic abortion | 3 articles.68–70 Studies evaluate different abortion methods, so all strategies will equally result in pregnancy termination. Strategies may result in higher risks of future infertility, but these future lost QALYs are not considered. | 
*| Contraception for women and men | 4 articles.71–74 Cost per pregnancy averted or cost per woman’s QALY gained. No studies consider child QALY losses from intentionally prevented pregnancy or maternal QALY losses for complications such as infertility due to ectopic pregnancy. | 
*| Preeclampsia treatment | 3 articles.82–84 One study includes offspring QALYs; one does not include these QALYs due to lack of data; one reports intermediate outcome only. | 
*| Treatment of diabetes in pregnant women | 8 articles.16–23 Studies generally include offspring QALYs and/or maternal QALYs lost from loss of fetus/baby and maternal QALYs gained from improved maternal health. | 
*| Treatment of diabetes in women of childbearing age | 3 articles.85–87 Studies consider net gain/loss of value. Benefits include lower costs for mother during pregnancy and for mother/child after successful birth and perhaps better long-term outcomes for mother/child. It is not always clear how lost pregnancies are to be valued in terms of lost maternal QALYs versus lost future QALYs for a fetus surviving to birth. | 
*| Smoking cessation for pregnant women | 11 articles.43–53 Often cost-benefit analysis (costs of outcomes such as preterm newborns but not necessarily lost QALYs if they die) or intermediate outcomes are considered. Much more focused on maternal QALYs than potential offspring QALYs. | 
*| Smoking cessation for women of childbearing age | 1 article.88 Considers net gain/loss of value. Benefit is reduced short-term cost of low-birth-weight children. | 
*| Genetic testing of pregnant women and their fetuses | 18 articles.24–41 Studies generally include the cost of having a child with disabilities. Some studies include maternal QALY gains/losses due to false-positive screening result, miscarriage, pregnancy termination, and giving birth to an affected child. Some studies assume the possibility of a “replacement child” after pregnancy termination. | 
*| Preconception genetic testing | 5 articles.41,103–106 Cost per future affected birth avoided. One study also reports cost per carrier detected. No studies consider QALYs. | 
*| IVF and ARTs | 10 articles.107–116 Cost per intermediate outcome (live birth or live healthy birth) but no loss of QALYs for fetal loss or children with birth complications (low birth weight). Sometimes maternal QALYs are considered. One study that considers maternal QALYs presents philosophical reason for not including offspring QALYs. | 
*| Preimplantation genetic screening | 1 article.110 Cost per healthy infant. No loss for termination or problems after birth. | 
*| Prepregnancy genetic screening | 5 articles.41,103–106 Cost per case averted or per carrier detected. One study mentions that other outcomes are not included because there is no consensus about how people behave with this information in terms of pregnancy/termination. | 
*| Folate supplementation for pregnant women | 7 articles.117–123 Generally, QALYs gained from children born healthy and avoiding neural tube defects because of the intervention. Studies do not all count fetuses lost before birth. No studies count maternal/paternal QALYs from having such a loss or for having children with or without a neural tube defect. | 
*| Folate supplementation for women of childbearing age | 1 article.88 Cost per neural tube defect averted. Short-term costs only. | 
*| Vasectomy | 2 articles.74,77 Costs per pregnancy averted or couple-years of protection. Studies do not consider potential demand for future vasectomy reversal/inability to reverse in all cases/loss of unwanted future infertility. Studies do not consider loss of child QALYs. | 
*| Vasectomy reversal | 4 articles.78–81 Cost per live birth or cost per pregnancy. | 
*| Imaging in pregnant women | 1 article on imaging for preoperative appendix removal.134 Maternal QALYs from direct health benefits. Newborn QALYs conditional on birth. No maternal QALY loss for leukemia, preterm birth, or miscarriage caused by imaging. | 
*| Female HPV vaccination | 3 articles.89–91 Female QALY gains including those from avoiding hysterectomy but no fertility-specific effect of this or child QALYs. | 
*| Male HPV vaccination | 2 articles.92,93 Cost per male or female QALY gained. Female QALYs gained when males do not transmit HPV to them. | 
*| Hysterectomy | 5 articles on hysterectomy for benign conditions.94–98 Women’s QALYs gained due to treatment of the benign conditions. No fertility issues considered even though some of the comparators are less invasive and more fertility sparing. | 
*| Chemotherapy for cancer in women of childbearing age | 2 articles.99,100 Studies consider women’s QALYs gained due to treatment but do not consider fertility losses due to treatment. | 
*| Chemotherapy for testicular cancer | 2 articles.101,102 Studies consider gains in men’s health due to cancer treatment, but do not consider potential health losses due to future infertility. | 
Note: ART = assisted reproductive technology; DALY = disability-adjusted life-year; HIV = human immunodeficiency virus; HPV = human papilloma virus; IVF = in vitro fertilization; QALY = quality-adjusted life-year.

Theme 1: Studies Are Heterogeneous in How They Report Outcomes
Reviewed studies most frequently included intended intervention outcomes for mothers (66%) and children (67%) and less frequently for partners/fathers (16%). Studies included unintended outcomes much less frequently: mothers (20%); children (16%); partners/fathers (4%). Most studies (62%) reported intended outcomes for only 1 recipient (mother, child, or partner/father); 27% reported for 2 recipients and 11% reported for 3 recipients. For unintended outcomes, 68% reported no outcomes, 26% reported for 1 recipient, and 6% reported for 2 or 3.
The time horizon for measuring benefits also differed. If reporting on maternal outcomes, 47% of studies used a lifetime horizon, 22% considered gestation and the perinatal period, and 31% used another horizon (e.g., through menopause). These percentages were roughly similar for child outcomes. Though reported less frequently, 63% of studies reporting partner/father outcomes used a lifetime time horizon, with the remainder using another horizon (e.g., period of childbearing for the couple).
Theme 2: Studies Select Outcomes for Inclusion That Tend to Bias toward Finding the Intended Purpose of the Interventions to Be Cost-effective
We found evidence of systematic bias in the inclusion of outcomes for economic evaluations. Specifically, if the goal of an intervention was to increase fertility or prevent harms to fetuses, studies tended to count newborn QALYs as gains and fetal deaths as losses. If the goal was to decrease fertility or prevent the birth of babies with harmful genetic conditions, QALYs of current and future newborns were typically not counted.
Studies evaluating interventions intended to decrease fertility or childbearing in general or selectively (e.g., vasectomy, abortion, prenatal screening) were less likely to report on intended effects of the intervention on the fetus or child (P < 0.018) than those that evaluated interventions intended to increase fertility or childbearing (e.g., folate supplementation, smoking cessation for pregnant women).
We expand on this point qualitatively by comparing studies of screening for and treatment of diabetes in pregnant women16–23 with those on prenatal genetic testing for pregnant women.24–41
Better treatment of diabetes and better glucose control during pregnancy have as one of their intended effects the prevention of miscarriage. The 8 studies we reviewed included both maternal and child QALYs and most deemed fetal loss to be a harm, quantified either as a loss of maternal QALYs or as a loss of QALYs of a future child or both.
In contrast, the most frequent intended purpose of prenatal genetic screening is to give prospective parents the opportunity to abort a fetus with a harmful genetic condition. The 18 studies we reviewed tended either to include only maternal QALYs or else to leave the outcome as cost per case of a given genetic condition averted.
Including only maternal QALYs accentuates the estimated cost-effectiveness of prenatal genetic screening; most studies included no loss of QALYs for fetuses with the genetic condition who might have become babies with the condition, thus making such screening appear more cost-effective than it would appear if these QALY losses were included. In their 2013 study, Ohno and others36(p632) provided the explicit rationale for this exclusion: “Only maternal QALYs were used because including neonatal QALYs would bias against such diagnostic tools since a possible outcome after diagnosis included termination.” Other authors made similar statements in their studies of prenatal genetic screening.32,35 Yet a 2011 study by Ohno and others20 on diabetes treatment during pregnancy counted fetal loss as a loss of QALYs to the mother as well as a loss of QALYs for a future child.
Theme 3: Studies Often Avoid the Challenges of Assigning QALYs for Pregnancy and Fertility-related Outcomes by Instead Reporting Costs per Intermediate Outcome(s)
Many studies avoided expressing outcomes in terms of QALYs and instead reported only intermediate outcomes such as cost per successful fertilization or cost per negative health outcome averted. Among studies that reported an outcome for a given recipient, those reporting intended outcomes used QALYs or net benefit as measures of benefit only 59% of the time for mothers, 65% of the time for children, and 50% of the time for partners/fathers. Studies were generally self-consistent with the measure of benefit they used for multiple recipients: 86% of studies reporting outcomes for mothers and children used the same measures of benefit (P < 0.0001 with Fisher’s exact test). We found similar within-study consistency for reporting outcomes of mothers and partners/fathers (94%; P = 0.001) and for children and partners/fathers (92%; P = 0.002).
One rationale for reporting intermediate, separate outcomes may be that because issues regarding QALY gains and losses due to current and future fertility are thorny, analysts wish to allow policy makers and other readers to draw their own conclusions from the disaggregated set of outcomes resulting from each intervention. However, such an approach makes it difficult to combine parental, fetal, and neonatal outcomes into a single QALY measure, thus hindering comparison of health outcomes across interventions.2,42 Whether aggregating the outcomes to QALYs or keeping them disaggregated, it is important to reiterate (per Theme 2) that studies often failed to report all relevant outcomes.
Theme 4: Even for the Same Intervention, Studies Take Heterogeneous Approaches to Outcome Inclusion
Studies of the same intervention did not all examine the same outcomes in the same ways. For intervention categories (e.g., prenatal genetic screening) that had at least 6 studies reporting outcomes, we found no category in which all studies reported maternal outcomes or child outcomes with the same measure of benefit (e.g., QALYs). For example, the 11 studies of smoking cessation programs for pregnant women that we reviewed43–53 variously considered as health outcomes the number of women who quit smoking, the number of low-birth-weight cases averted, the number of perinatal deaths averted, the number of cases of sudden infant death syndrome averted, and maternal QALYs gained due to smoking cessation. The 8 articles of chlamydia screening and treatment54–61 (among mainly nonpregnant individuals) variously considered as outcomes the number of chlamydia infections diagnosed, cases of pelvic inflammatory disease averted, QALYs gained among women due to improved health, QALYs gained among women due to improved fertility, QALYs gained among men due to improved health, and newborn QALYs gained due to improved health. Additionally, studies in the same category often measured outcomes over different time horizons. Such variability in outcome reporting makes it difficult to compare the results of different studies of the same intervention.
Theme 5: There Exist Multiple, Competing Rationales for Whether and How to Include Fertility-related QALYs and Whether These Should Be for the Mother Only or for Both Parents
It is fairly noncontroversial that once babies are born, streams of QALYs attach to them. It is less clear whether and how to count the loss of a current pregnancy or the development of infertility. One approach is to consider the risk of a fetus not coming to term and being born, and, conditional upon the child being born, to consider the probability distribution of the child’s potential health states. One could multiply these probabilities with future streams of QALYs over the child’s life expectancy, conditional upon the child being born (assigning a value of 0 for loss prior to birth) to compute QALYs from lost pregnancies and infertility. This approach assigns QALY losses to interventions that temporarily or permanently reduce fertility or that end pregnancies. One can also consider infertility from the parental perspective—the diminution in quality of life experienced by those desiring to become mothers and fathers when they are unable to do so. These two approaches are not mutually exclusive, though one or the other is used in most of the studies we reviewed.
We compared articles dealing with the treatment of sexually transmitted disease (STDs) for pregnant women (8 articles on chlamydia54–61 and 6 articles on HIV and vertical transmission62–67) to articles dealing with termination or prevention of pregnancies (3 articles on abortion,68–70 4 articles on contraception in the general population,71–74 and 2 articles on contraception for HIV-infected women75,76). Studies on STD treatment typically considered increased maternal QALYs due to intended health gains and sometimes also lost maternal QALYs from fetal loss and paternal QALYs gained from improved paternal health (for chlamydia treatment). Additionally, the studies assigned lifetime QALYs gained if a child is born healthy as opposed to HIV-infected or chlamydia-affected. Differential rates of miscarriage were not considered in these studies. In contrast, the studies on the termination or prevention of pregnancies limited themselves to maternal QALYs gained or to intermediate outcomes (e.g., pregnancies prevented). They generally considered complications from procedures as health harms but did not consider maternal QALYs lost due to long-term infertility resulting from ectopic pregnancy or other complications of short-term interventions to reduce fertility. They also did not consider paternal QALYs lost from infertility of a spouse/partner. Most important, the studies of STD treatment assigned QALY gains to healthy babies, whereas the studies of pregnancy prevention or termination did not assign a QALY loss to pregnancies averted or terminated.
We examined 2 studies of vasectomy74,77 and 4 studies of vasectomy reversal.78–81 The reviewed vasectomy studies focused on the intermediate outcomes of pregnancies averted and couple-years of protection. These studies essentially treated vasectomy as a final and irreversible procedure and did not consider the possible future desire of a man to have a vasectomy reversal. Since successful vasectomy reversal may not be possible, this failure to consider such an outcome could lead to an overly optimistic assessment of the value of vasectomy. The studies on vasectomy reversal used intermediate outcomes of live births or pregnancies. The use of pregnancy as an outcome is notable because not all pregnancies result in live births.
As in Theme 1, a mother’s QALYs were more likely to be counted than a father’s. This makes more sense in some circumstances than in others. For example, women seeking to have children from anonymous sperm donors may achieve QALY gains whereas their donors do not. If a procedure is maternally focused, then by standard practice in CEA, the woman is the patient and hence her QALYs are central. Yet, for many situations, QALY losses attributable to not being able to be a parent or to the loss of an expected child are arguably experienced by both expectant parents. However, including QALY gains/losses for both parents would bias against mothers seeking to have children without a spouse or partner, as the number of QALYs gained would be fewer without the paternal QALYs.
Theme 6: QALYs Related to Pregnancy and Fertility Are More Likely to Be Ignored by Analyses That Consider Interventions Whose Impact on These Outcomes Is Indirect or Unintended
Economic evaluations of interventions where the main focus was maternal health or where the pregnancy and fertility effects were indirect (e.g., female HPV vaccination, treatment of testicular cancer) were less likely to report outcomes affecting a fetus or child (P < 0.01).
We examined a variety of interventions intended to address health conditions in women and men that could affect pregnancy or fertility outcomes. We first examined studies where improved pregnancy or fertility outcomes were an intended effect beyond the main effect of improving a woman’s health; they included treatment of preeclampsia and diabetes and smoking cessation in pregnant women (3 articles,82–84 8 articles,16–23 and 11 articles,43–53 respectively) and treatment of diabetes and smoking cessation in women intending to become pregnant (3 articles85–87 and 1 article,88 respectively). For the studies targeting pregnant women, maternal QALYs from intended health effects were often considered, while QALYs resulting from having live and healthy offspring were sometimes but not always included. Newborn QALYs were most likely to be included in studies evaluating diabetes control and smoking cessation among pregnant women, less likely in studies of diabetes control or smoking cessation for women intending future pregnancies, and least likely in studies of preeclampsia screening and treatment (where the immediate health benefits to the mother were likely greatest).
For economic evaluations of interventions with only indirect effects on pregnancy or fertility, the inclusion of pregnancy and fertility outcomes was even less likely. We considered studies of female and male HPV vaccination (3 articles89–91 and 2 articles,92,93 respectively), hysterectomy to address fibroids or other conditions (5 articles94–98), and chemotherapy for cancer in women of childbearing age (2 articles99,100) or for men with testicular cancer (2 articles101,102). The studies of female HPV vaccination considered women’s QALYs and included the direct health benefits of avoiding hysterectomies but not the health benefits of preserved fertility (to women or to resulting QALYs from offspring). The studies of male HPV vaccination considered male QALYs resulting from direct health benefits as well as the prevention of transmission to women whose health gains, also measured in QALYs. These again included avoided hysterectomies but did not include health benefits from preservation of a woman’s fertility. When hysterectomy for conditions like fibroids was considered, women’s QALY gains from direct health effects were included but fertility effects were not considered, despite the fact that fertility-sparing alternatives were sometimes comparators. One study avoided the issue by focusing exclusively on women with no desire for future children.94 The studies of chemotherapy that could damage a current fetus or alter fertility considered only the direct health benefits to men and women.
We compared studies considering genetic testing during pregnancy (18 articles24–41) and prior to pregnancy (5 articles41,103–106) along with studies on IVF and other assisted reproductive technology (10 articles107–116), genetic screening of fertilized embryos prior to IVF (1 article110), and folate supplementation during or prior to pregnancy (7 articles117–123 and 1 article,88 respectively). For studies of genetic testing during pregnancy, the cost of having a child with a disabling condition if testing is not done or fails was typically included. Studies often used intermediate outcomes including unnecessary termination of a healthy fetus or else focused exclusively on maternal QALYs. In some studies the concept of a “replacement child” was used to justify not counting lost QALYs of having a child with disabilities relative to having no child at all; this assumes that the couple can conceive a child again relatively quickly if they choose to terminate the current pregnancy due to a suspected genetic disability. Likewise, studies of genetic screening prior to pregnancy focused on intermediate outcomes such as affected births averted or carriers detected. In contrast, studies of IVF or other reproductive technologies focused on intermediate outcomes such as live births (or live healthy births) and generally did not consider the greater risks of low-birth-weight babies or other conditions resulting from carrying multiple fetuses to term. Somewhat inconsistently, the study examining the value of preimplantation genetic screening in IVF focused on the outcome of healthy infants. The studies of folate supplementation likewise focused on the intermediate outcome of healthy children born or on QALYs gained. An approach that assigns QALYs based on the health status of children born ranks healthy children higher than disabled children and ranks disabled children higher than not having a child or losing a child. Using an intermediate outcome of healthy births essentially ranks births of children in ill health as equal to having no child at all even if the intent of the expectant parents is never to abort.
Theme 7: The Above Six Themes Appear in Studies from All Years of Our Review, Including Those Recently Published
Our literature review included studies published over the past 4 decades (1974–2014). If we limit our analysis to studies published in the past decade (68% of the reviewed studies), we continue to observe the six themes identified above. Thus, the shortcomings of early studies have largely not been remedied by more recent publications.
Discussion
Economic evaluations of interventions that may affect current and future fertility and childbearing consider their outcomes in an inconsistent manner that frequently appears biased toward the interventions considered. Indirect effects on fertility are often ignored. Even for the same intervention, studies take heterogeneous approaches to outcome inclusion, and even recent studies often appear inconsistent and biased. While there have been major trends in standardization for economic evaluation of health interventions generally, standardization is lacking in this area.
Although we performed a targeted rather than systematic review, we looked across a broad spectrum of interventions and economic evaluations of those interventions. The patterns we identified appear repeatedly in the 108 studies we reviewed.
Our review contributes to the prior literature in several ways. We found few prior reviews of interventions with indirect effects on pregnancy and fertility other than that of Pynna and others,124 and none that considered this issue across multiple conditions or interventions. In editorials and reviews of specific conditions or interventions related to pregnancy and fertility, other authors have examined the issue of which outcomes to count and how to value them and have noted some of the themes we highlight. Mooney and Lange125 described a variety of methods for valuing losses of fetuses in current pregnancies in the context of prenatal genetic testing. Ganiats126 considered this issue in the context of abortion more generally, noting the inconsistency of counting streams of future costs for children born with disabilities but not QALYs lost or gained from fetuses aborted or for children with disabilities who might have been born in the current pregnancy (due to “false positives”) or in the future. Petrou127 and Trussell128 echoed earlier work, noting that when considering pregnancies prevented or ended, if streams of averted costs are included then so too should be streams of lost benefits. Garceau and others129 reviewed economic evaluations of assisted reproductive technologies and noted the frequent use of short-term perspectives and intermediate outcomes and the failure to consider long-term health risks of multiple births, especially from preterm delivery, for mother and children. Yi and others130 noted the heterogeneity and selectivity of intermediate outcomes included in economic evaluations of folate supplementation. Pynna and others124 observed that economic evaluations of hysterectomy for benign conditions also are selective about which outcomes they include. Regarding changes in QALYs or other measures of benefits for parents resulting from outcomes for fetuses prior to birth, Simon and others131 noted that economic evaluations are conducted from the time point when the intervention is delivered—which is often during pregnancy itself—and hence it is inconsistent not to value miscarriage and stillbirths as losses both from the mother’s perspective and as future losses. Caughey and others132 noted that screening and other interventions offered for fetuses can have psychological benefits to prospective parents by alleviating anxiety and providing greater opportunities to prepare for the child’s birth. Ungar133 considered a number of related issues and challenges in the context of child health.
We reviewed many examples of interventions that collectively span our framework. However, there are numerous additional relevant interventions. One area of future work is to examine interventions conducted during labor and delivery that are intended to improve health outcomes for mother or child. In this area, it may be fruitful to examine whether CEAs capture other features that are relevant to patients’ decisions such as preferences for process aspects (e.g., hospital v. birthing center; obstetrician v. midwife), independent of their effects on health outcomes. Another area of future work is to examine in much greater detail CEAs that consider the wide variety of prenatal genetic screening strategies, as some strategies only involve serum screening whereas others involve invasive sample collection that can cause fetal loss.
Our proposed frameworks allow flexibility in characterizing studies while maintaining parsimony. Our framework does not directly reflect the distinction between pregnancies that are desired versus not desired. Such disaggregation may explain differential reporting of outcomes between interventions such as IVF and those such as abortion if only desired pregnancies are intended to be counted. However, this distinction raises other challenges such as whether one individual’s feelings about health outcomes of another (albeit future) individual should alter the normative way QALYs are counted for that individual. This is a clear illustration of the thorny issues facing guideline-setting groups in this area.
The selection of health outcomes to include in an economic evaluation of a health intervention that can affect fertility and childbearing can significantly influence the estimated cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Our analysis highlights the need for guidelines that can standardize the inclusion and measurement of the health outcomes of such interventions—the type of guidance that could be included in the update15 of Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine.2 Our work fits within past and ongoing discussions of where to draw the line for which effects and costs to include in economic evaluations of health interventions,4–8 as it has relevance, albeit relatively weak, for all interventions that affect survival of individuals who could otherwise have children now or in the future. In the absence of such guidelines, we recommend that analysts use the frameworks we have developed here to report in detail all direct and indirect outcomes considered, as well as those not considered, and perform sensitivity analysis with different health outcomes included. Such transparency in outcomes reporting is important in lieu of standardized inclusion and measurement criteria for health outcomes of such interventions.
