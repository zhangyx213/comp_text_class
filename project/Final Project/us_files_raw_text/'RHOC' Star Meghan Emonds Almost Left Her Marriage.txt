Aug 12, 2016( International Business Times News:  Delivered by Newstex)  When it comes to motherhood, Meghan King Edmonds doesn't mess around. The 'Real Housewives of Orange Country' star has revealed she gave her husband, former professional baseball player Jim Edmonds, an ultimatum: either have a baby with her or she would walk away from their marriage. 
'I think I said, 'Baby, or no me at all.' All or nothing,' Megan told People[1]. Megan and Jim, who made it known last season he didn't want more children, are now expecting their first child together this winter, so it appears they won't be taking the divorce route. Meghan King Edmonds' pregnancy journey hasn't been easy. She is pictured during a recent appearance on Bravo TV's 'Watch What Happens Live!'

After Jim agreed to have a child with Meghan, his wife of almost two years, he had to unfreeze his pre-vasectomy sperm for Megan's IVF[2] (In Vitro Fertilization) procedure. Megan's IVF journey has been chronicled on Season 11 of the Bravo series. In episode 1, cameras followed the 31-year-old as she went to her first doctors appointment without Jimmy, 46, by her side. Thankfully for the reality star, who has an admitted fear of needles, she conceived on her first try.  'It was just such long process with the IVF,' Meghan tells People. '... But it's still such an incredible miserable. I can't even describe the feeling.'
