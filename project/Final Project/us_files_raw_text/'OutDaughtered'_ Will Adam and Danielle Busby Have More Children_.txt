Count in their four-year-old daughter Blayke and suddenly the Busbys went from a family of three to a family of eight in the blink of an eye. IMDB reports that at one time the family prepared 40 baby bottles per day and changed 420 diapers per week. Talk about a huge adjustment — and a lot of extra work.'OutDaughtered' offers a glimpse into their busy livesThe popular TLC show follows the family as they navigate the chaotic reality of raising all their daughters. The family recently relocated, and people on social media had a few words to say about the lack of fencing around their pool. This safety hazard could even prove fatal. But then again, critics are bound to make themselves heard when a family is in the public eye. The Busbys were quick to point out that they had just moved in and were planning to put a fence around the pool shortly.Do the Busbys want more children?One question that people with big families always get: Are they planning to have any more? Even though the Busbys have only been blessed with girls so far, it doesn't sound like they intend to add any more little ones to the mix. They believe their family is complete now. During the show's first season in 2016, Danielle Busby spoke with her husband about getting a vasectomy. According to People, Danielle explained their infrequent sexual encounters by saying, 'Adam —you want this, you've got to get that snipped.'

She included stories about the stress of injections, negative pregnancy tests, infertility drugs, and invasive assisted reproduction procedures. Their journey to parenthood wasn't easy.
