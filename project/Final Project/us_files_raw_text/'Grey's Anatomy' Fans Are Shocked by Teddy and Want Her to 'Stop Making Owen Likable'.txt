 Grey's Anatomy[1] fans have a history of not liking Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd). But their tune changed when Teddy Altman[2] (Kim Raver) had a surprising stance on how to raise their kid. 
[Spoiler alert: Warning spoilers for the Grey's Anatomy episode 'Should I Stay or Should I Go'!]

The beginning of 'Should I Stay or Should I Go' shows Owen and Teddy entering the hospital with the kids. Leo is dressed[7] in a flannel shirt and a hat for a rancher. Teddy calls him a cowboy, and Leo says he's a girl. Teddy tells Leo that he's a boy, only wearing a cowgirl costume. He accepts that. 
Teddy tells Owen that Leo is 'obviously' confused about gender. She proposes getting a therapist to help their child. The parents then get busy with a new patient. 
The mother brings it up later in the episode. She says they'll have to confront the situation eventually because what would his mother think if she found out? Owen still wanted to stay focused on their patient who had lost his arm. 
Owen later said he wasn't surprised and thought Leo might be trans ever since he wore a tutu. He then told Teddy that they need to follow his lead even if he changes what he says about his gender in the future. 
'Grey's Anatomy' fans are shocked and want her to 'stop making Owen likable'

Many fans have turned on Owen over the years[12]. But some were shocked by the newest episode. They shared their reactions to Teddy's comments on Reddit[13]. 
'Goddddd Teddy stop making Owen likable,' one fan wrote. 
'Not Owen doing something likable?? Cmon Teddy support your kid,' another fan commented. 
Some people thought the storyline was inconsistent with Teddy's character. 'I'm honestly confused on Teddy having a problem with Leo. ESPECIALLY since she is Bi. It's not clicking,' another fan wrote. 
'Not teddy being anti lgbtq when her girlfriend literally died in 9/11????' a third person wrote. 
Some fans wrote about turning around on Owen by the end of the episode. 'Leo is a trans icon and Owen is and ally and I'm obsessed,' one fan commented. 'Sincerely, A reformed Owen hater.' 
'The redemption arc for Owen that we never saw coming lol,' someone else added. 
What do Teddy and Owen decide in the end?

The episode ended with Teddy and Owen having another conversation outside of the hospital[15]. Teddy explained her surprising stance to him. 
'I want Leo to be happy,' she said. 'I never wanted anything but happiness for our kids. But I just don't wanna mess this up. And it just feels like there are a million ways to get it wrong, and if Leo were 10 we would be having a different conversation, but he's not. And you know neither one of us has done enough research to know how to handle this. And I wanna get it right and going all-in now. It just doesn't seem right, Owen.' 
Owen said he didn't want to be Leo's first bully and to love him. Teddy agreed with the statement but asked, what if they don't agree on the approach? 
The parents still didn't settle on how to handle the matter. But they both agreed to go to therapy for themselves to figure it out.
