In the words of comedienne Lily Tomlin: "I sometimes worry that God has developed Alzheimer’s and completely forgotten about us."  
Or, maybe sometimes he’s just wishing he could. 
- At a court hearing in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., where a husband became angry his wife failed to wish him a happy birthday and then faced domestic violence charges after it developed into a major argument, a judge skipped bond or jail time and sentenced the 43-year-old man to having to treat his wife to dinner, then take her out bowling and undergo marriage counseling. 
- In Kansas, in its latest move to ward off the "mistreatment" and "misrepresentation" of animals, PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) announced it was opposed to plans to make Toto the "Official State Dog of Kansas." 
 w In Barnstable, Mass., suggesting that getting a vasectomy during the NCAA basketball tournament was the "perfect time" because typically a day or two of recovery time lounging on the couch is needed, as an added incentive, a urologist threw in one free pizza as part of the deal as well. 
- At Richmond Memorial Hospital in Rockingham, N.C., officials began evacuating patients from their rooms after they began complaining that the bats that had infested parts of the hospital were getting into patients’ rooms, too. 
- In Woonsocket, R.I., where the school board said the district’s debt was "only getting worse" and it needed to find additional revenue before continuing on, officials authorized the sending of layoff notices to 600 school employees -the district’s entire teaching staff. 
- At a Wal-Mart in Exton, Pa., noticed in the parking lot by other shoppers as he was taking off all of his clothes, a 6-foot-4, 32-year-old man then was charged with shoplifting after he walked into the store naked to steal a pair of socks. 
- In Washington, D.C., the White House apologized after an aide to Vice President Joe Biden sent out a press release on the week’s travels for Biden and spelled the state "Road Island."  
- At a Denny’s in Madison, Wis., a 52-year-old man in a suit, carrying a briefcase and saying he was sent by Denny’s corporate office to be the new manager, introduced himself to staff, walked behind the grill, cooked himself a cheeseburger and fries and, as he ate the meal, was arrested by police for making up the story. 
- In Orland Park, the Chicago suburb, a 32-year-old man who was building a backyard shed said he felt a "ting" to the side of his head as his nail gun backfired but could not find where the nail had gone. In a four-hour surgery two days later, doctors removed it from his brain. 
- Dousing a grease fire at a sausage factory in New Castle, Pa., firefighters saved 200 pounds of Polish sausage and, in its aftermath, were also savoring what they called "the best-smelling fire" they’d fought in years.  
- In Port Colborne, Ontario, a man who died of a heart attack while he was running bath water was not discovered for two weeks. His family is now asking city officials for a break on their $623 water bill. 
- At Jones County Junior College in Ellisville, Miss., a 19-year-old was questioned by police and then arrested after he left a note on a piece of toilet paper to a friend that read, "I just passed a bomb in the library." Charges were later dropped, though, after it was confirmed the statement was a reference to "passing bodily gas."
