 A Chicago woman who was ousted from her Jeep at gunpoint during a carjacking had her vehicle returned to her — just to have it stolen again days later in another part of the city Sunday, according to a report.

 Spanish Government Contributing to Persecution of Catholics: Report[161] 
 Attacks on freedom of religion have increased by 37 percent in Spain compared to 2019, according to the Observatory for Religious Freedom and Conscience (OLRC) in its latest report for the year 2020. This growth took place in spite of the incredibly restrictive lockdown that was imposed in Spain, which forbade people from leaving their homes and traveling across the country. 
 Owing to a complaint filed by conservative party Vox to the Spanish Constitutional Tribunal, the lockdown was deemed an unconstitutional and illegal action taken by the government. However, many of those who practice their faith in Spain, particularly Catholics, suffered during the lockdowns. 
 'Freedom of religion is a basic right. It seems, however, that some politicians have used the pandemic to restrict it,' head of the OLRC Maria Garcia commented on the report.

 Swedish Cartoonist Targeted by Assassins for Drawing Mohammed Killed in Car Crash[165] 
 Lars Vilks and his two police guards have been killed in a head-on collision with a truck in Markaryd, Sweden.

 The 2007 drawings of Muhammad placed Vilks at the center of a global debate regarding freedom of speech and respect for religious beliefs. Extremists tried to kill him for blasphemy, which is why he was under police protection. 
 The cartoonist and his police escort were traveling in an unmarked police car on Sunday when the incident happened. For some reason, the fast-moving vehicle veered onto the wrong side of the road, tearing through a wire fence that separated the lanes, and collided head on with a truck, the local media reported.

 Migration Pressure on Hungary Keeps Growing, 80,000 Illegal Crossings Recorded in 2021[207] 
 Hungary has experienced a continuous wave of migration pressure in 2021, with the number of illegal border crossings exceeding 80,000 this year, more than three times that of last year, György Bakondi, the prime minister's chief domestic security adviser said Sunday night on national television's M1's news channel. 
 During the great wave of 2015, many migrants came from Turkey to the Greek islands.

Migrants have responded by heading directly to the Italian islands, and migratory pressure on Greece has intensified at the land border, he said.
