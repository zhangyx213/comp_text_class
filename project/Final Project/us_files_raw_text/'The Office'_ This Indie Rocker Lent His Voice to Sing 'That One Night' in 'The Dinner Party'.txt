You took me by the hand Made me a man That one night You made everything all right So raw, so right, all night, all right Oh yeah 
Like a fine wine that's reached its time You're aged to perfection And I was ready to dine I needed your confection, yeah That one night You made everything all right' 

Eisenberg and Stupnitsky have confirmed the song is 'about Jan' toOfficeTally[13]. But the specifics of the song are open to interpretation. To most fans, 'That One Night' symbolizesHunter losing his virginity[14]to his former boss.
