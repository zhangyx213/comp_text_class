SCIENTISTS HAVE found a way to cause temporary infertility in male mice - and the breakthrough could lead to the first birth control pill for men.
The findings, reported in the October issue of Science, raise the possibility of more birth control options for men beyond condoms and vasectomies.
Researchers focused on a protein found in both mice and men - and were able to sterilize the rodents by blocking the protein.
By feeding the mice two existing drugs - cyclosporine A and tacrolimus - they were able to block their production of calcineurin. Without calcineurin, the mice were essentially infertile - since their sperm was too weak to impregnate females. When the scientists stopped doping the rodents, their fertility came back within a week.
It's not yet known if the same process will work in humans.
