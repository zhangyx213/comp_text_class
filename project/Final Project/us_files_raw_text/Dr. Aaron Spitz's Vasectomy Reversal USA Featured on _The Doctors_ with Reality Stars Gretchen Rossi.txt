 Laguna Hills, CA -- (ReleaseWire[1]) -- 11/25/2014 -- Vasectomy Reversal USA is part of Dr. Aaron Spitz's practice, Orange County Urology Associates Inc. in California. They provide fertility treatments and vasectomy reversals in San Diego[2] and other surrounding regions. Recently, Dr. Spitz was featured on the popular series 'The Doctors', where he interviewed reality TV couple Gretchen Rossi and Slade Smiley, and they discussed their experiences and thoughts about fertility treatments, vasectomy reversals and even in-vitro fertilization (IVF), though Spitz does not perform IVF; some of his associates do.

A vasectomy can be a curse or a blessing, depending on an individual's desires. For someone looking to avoid having a family or creating an even larger, unsustainable family, vasectomy is a great option for continuing an active, healthy sex life. 

Vasectomy reversal is available for men that have avoided pregnancies and starting a family in the past, and then changed their mind. For individuals like this, vasectomy reversal will improve their sex lives, and offer the promise of a new family, which can strengthen a marriage. 

Vasectomies and Vasectomy Reversal each have their place in the world of fertility treatment and relationship/marriage improvement. Dr. Spitz understands this, offering more than just vasectomy and vasectomy reversal treatments at his fertility clinic. Dr. Spitz can also be found on Vasectomy Reversal USA's[3] YouTube Channel[4], where he highlights pressing issues, addresses myths and tries to eliminate misconceptions regarding fertility, male and female anatomy and sexual mishaps, like premature ejaculation. There is something for everyone on the channel; Dr. Spitz has no qualms with addressing a multitude of issues, and is very open about his practice.

Gretchen and Slade are still fighting to conceive their first child, and have experienced their share of hardships during the process. Restoring fertility and starting a family is a stressful and emotional experience for couples and families alike; Gretchen and Slade are a perfect example of this. However, couples that do not abandon hope and persevere can find success with fertility and the promise of starting a new family.

Vasectomy Reversal USA and Orange County Urology Associates Inc. gladly serve clientele within Orange County and San Diego. Vasectomy Reversals[5] are just one facet of the practice, as they also offer no-scalpel, no-needle vasectomies, sperm extraction for IVFs provided by Spitz's associates, and more. Call Aaron Spitz's practice today toll-free for a complimentary consultation at 800-352-2956.
