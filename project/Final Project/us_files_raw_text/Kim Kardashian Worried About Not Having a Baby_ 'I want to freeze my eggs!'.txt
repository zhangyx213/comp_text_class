On the recent episode of "Keeping Up With The Kardashian's," Khloe and Kim tackles some baby issues.
 The recent episode of the Kardashians was mostly about one topic, babies. Scott Disick is planning a vasectomy, Khloe is seeking answers about her fertility and Kim is planning to freeze her eggs. These are private details that should remain private for most people, but since it's the Kardashian's, anything and everything is exposed to the public.
 It's no secret that Khloe is desperate to have a baby and start a family with her husband Omar. But on the recent episode, it looks like the pressure was all too much for her to take. And while Khloe explores ways to increase her fertility, Scott Disick pays a visit to the doctor to talk about vasectomy.
 Scott was bemused upon finding out that Kourtney wants four more children and has no plans to go on birth control again.
 Meanwhile, Kim came to Khloe's recue when she advised her sister to come see a fertility specialist. But not too long after, the focus shifted on Kim. It looks like Kim was worried that her situation could be worse than her younger sister, Khloe.
 Being 31 years old, Kim fears that by the time she decides to have children she will not be able to do so or would meet the same struggles as that of Khloe's. So in the end, Kim talks about the option of having her eggs frozen.
 In addition to the weirdness of the family, Kris was eager to flaunt her breast operation to her children. Khloe cringes as her mother shows off her augmented breasts.
