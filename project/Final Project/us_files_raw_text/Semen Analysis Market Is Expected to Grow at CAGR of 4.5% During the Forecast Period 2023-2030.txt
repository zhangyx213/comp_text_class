 Semen Analysis Market is segmented By Product Type (Analyzers, Accessories and Disposables, Semen Test Kits, Others), By Application (Human, Veterinary), By End-User (Hospitals, Fertility Centers, Diagnostic Centers, Animal Breeding Centers, Home Care Settings, Others) 
Hyderabad, Telengana -- (SBWIRE[1]) -- 02/17/2023 -- Overview: 
Sperm analysis is a test that is used to determine the viability, health, and quality of sperm. It is done by couples who are unable to conceive naturally, as well as for medical needs such as animal breeding. Based on numerous parameters, the analysis is performed to assess fundamental characteristics such as sperm volume, sperm concentration, motility, morphology, and viability. Because sperm count varies everyday and an average of sperm samples may offer the most definitive result, the tests are spread out across two to three months, with at least seven days between each.
