Nov 21, 2018( Gates of Vienna: / Delivered by Newstex)  A man shouting 'Allahu Akhbar' approached policemen in Brussels and stabbed at least one of them in the neck. He was then shot and wounded by the police. Belgian authorities have not yet determined a motive for the attack, but say the incident had nothing to do with terrorism. In other news, Australia, Poland, and Israel have joined the ranks of nations that will decline to sign the UN's migration pact.

What's more, this apparently was 'not the first time Avenatti has been aggressive.'[82]  Acosta Has No Constitutional Right to a White House Pass[83] If you wanted a constitutional crisis, folks, federal judge Thomas Kelly has given us one with the issuance of a temporary restraining order requiring the Trump White House to reinstate CNN's petulant Jim Acosta's press pass giving him access to the building in which President Trump resides and leads the Free World. Revoking Acosta's press pass did not threaten the First Amendment rights of either CNN or Acosta. CNN is free to broadcast what it wants and report on anything it wants and Acosta is free to do the same. The funny thing about freedom of speech and freedom of the press is that while both freedoms are constitutionally guaranteed, the Constitution does not guarantee a right to a particular forum. There is no more right for Jim Acosta to have White House credentials than there is to have White House press conferences at all:[84]  Brenda Snipes Resigns: 'I Have Served the Purpose I Came Here for'[85] Brenda Snipes submitted her resignation as the elections supervisor of Broward County, Florida. Her decision came one day after Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum offered his second concession to Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) in the Sunshine State's gubernatorial election. 'I think I have served the purpose that I came here for, which was to provide a credible election product for our voters,' said Snipes last week during a press conference. NBC's local affiliate in South Florida reported: '[Brenda Snipes's] office illegally destroyed 6,000 ballots in 2016 after they were counted but a judge ordered them to be preserved.'[86]  Cop Tasked With Helping Child Sex Crime Victims Arrested for Raping a Child Victim He Was 'Helping'[87] A disturbing case of police rape has surfaced out of the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department this week as a detective assigned to handle victims of child molestation cases was arrested for allegedly raping a 14-year-old girl. The girl was a victim in a case the officer was investigating and had already been raped by someone else. Detective Neil Kimball, 45, was assigned to the Special Victims Bureau, a unit tasked with investigation cases of sex crimes against children. Kimball was arrested on Friday on suspicion of rape by force and 'preventing or dissuading a witness or victim from testifying,' said Nicole Nishida, spokeswoman for the department's Internal Criminal Investigations Bureau. Given the number of victims Kimball has had contact with in the past, this case has caused grave concern at the department. According to the LA Times, Kimball has investigated dozens of child molestation cases in the last 5 years as a member of the elite specialized unit.[88]  Federal Judge Finds Female Genital Mutilation Law Unconstitutional[89] In a major blow to the government, a federal judge in Detroit has declared the nation's female genital mutilation law unconstitutional, thereby dismissing nearly all of the charges against two Michigan doctors and seven others accused of subjecting at least nine minor girls to genital cutting in the nation's first FGM case. The historic case involves minor girls from Michigan, Illinois and Minnesota, including some who cried, screamed and bled during the procedure and one who was given Valium ground in liquid Tylenol to keep her calm, court records show.[90]  Gunman on the Loose After Fatal Shooting, Sexual Assault at Catholic Supply Store in St. Louis County[91] ST. LOUIS COUNTY • A 53-year-old House Springs woman was shot and killed by a gunman at a Catholic Supply store in a strip mall on Manchester Road on Monday afternoon, police said. They identified her Tuesday morning as Jamie Schmidt, a customer at the store, where the gunman sexually assaulted at least one person before opening fire and then disappearing. Tuesday morning police released a detailed description of the attacker, saying he was a white man, about 40 to 50 years old, and 5 feet 7 inches to 5 feet 9 inches tall. He was wearing a black or gray 'paperboy-style' cap, a navy blue Carhartt-style jacket, a red, white and black plaid shirt, glasses, a brown belt with a a red and blue square on the buckle. The shooting was reported to police at 3:19 p.m., and police shut down the shopping center and launched a manhunt that lasted into the night[92]  Hollywood Actors Threaten to Boycott Georgia After Democrat's Loss[93] Several Hollywood actors are calling for a boycott of Georgia's film industry after Republican Brian Kemp officially won the state's gubernatorial contest against Democrat Stacey Abrams. But like the threats to move to Canada if Donald Trump won in 2016, these are also more than likely going to be hollow.[94]  Law Professor Sues University of California to Expose Anti-Asian Preferences[95] What are they hiding? The data will either exonerate or incriminate UC' A law professor at UCLA has filed a lawsuit against the University of California System for withholding records he believes could show it's illegally using race in admissions. While UC claims it doesn't have the 'specific data set' requested by Richard Sander, the professor told The College Fix that the same kind of data 'was provided to us 10 years ago.'[96]  Politicians and Police Set Tyranny's Perfect Example: Gun Confiscation[97] As a review of some of the current events that have been taking place in the U.S. recently, on 11/5/18, Anne Arundel County Police in Maryland shot and killed a man as they attempted to exercise a 'red flag' gun removal order. Those 'red flag' orders went into effect on October 1 of this year. Let's take the definition of this new 'game' directly from Wikipedia and examine it: A red flag law is a 'gun violence protection' law that permits police or family members to petition a state court to order the temporary removal of firearms from a person who may present a danger to others or themselves. A judge makes the determination to issue the order based on statements and actions made by the gun owner in question. After a set time, the guns are returned to the person from whom they were seized unless another court hearing extends the period of confiscation. Such orders are known as 'Extreme Risk Protection Orders' (ERPO) in Oregon, Washington, Maryland, and Vermont, as 'Risk Protection Orders' in Florida as 'Gun Violence Restraining Orders' in California; as 'risk warrants' in Connecticut; and as 'Proceedings for the Seizure and Retention of a Firearm' in Indiana. Returning to the incident in Maryland, take a look at this excerpt from CBS News from 11/6/18: Neither of the officers were injured. Their names weren't released. It wasn't clear why the 'red flag' order was issued. A spokeswoman for the Maryland Judiciary denied a request from the Baltimore Sun to release protection order requests associated with the home, citing the law which states the orders are confidential unless a court rules otherwise. Michele Willis, the man's niece, told the Baltimore Sun that one of her aunts requested the protective order against Willis, but she declined to say why. Maryland's law, which went into effect Oct. 1, is more broad in that it allows certain health care providers to seek an order, in addition to family members and law enforcement. LOOK HOW THINGS WORK IN THE TOTALITARIAN HEIR TO THE SOVIET UNION THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS BECOME! Sounds as if it's something right out of Solzhenitsyn, but here it is: The names of the cops were not released. [Secretive Policing] The Baltimore Sun could not report on associated case actions. [Muzzling of the Press] Maryland Judiciary using a law to prevent the public's knowledge without court approval. [Press ...blic Censorship] An aunt reported himbut no reasons given by family or police. ['Finger-Pointing' initiated] Health Care reporters and family members can 'blow the whistle and enable these 'red flag' orders to be set in motion. [State Powers of Arrest and complete abrogation of rights under the Constitution of the United States with no recourse] That's it. Everyone with the '300 Spartans' patch and the '???? ?a?' or '???O? ????' written on their sleeves? [ Translation: 'Come and Take it!' ] Yes, they will. They are. For now, they're attempting to do it without a fightpassing the legislation (or circumventing it, rather) and forcing the compliance of the citizenry. They are in the process of doing far more, and another episode really summarizes the key concept: the Totalitarian mindset of elected officials. This piece is entitled, 'California Democrat threatens 'Nukes' if Americans don't hand over their guns.' This threat is not figurative: it is literal. I strongly recommend reading the whole article. Democratic Congressman Eric Swalwell (D, CA) is proposing that the government offer up to $1,000 for semi-automatic weapons, and a 'buy-back' to place those firearms in the hands of the governmentfor an estimated cost of $15 billion This man should be removed from office immediately, no questions askedplaced upon administrative leave and then brought to bear for his statement. The mindset is the danger: this is not the exception among politicians, but the norm. In these 'neo-feudal' times, you the citizen are expected to wear your 'uniform,' the tan (called 'khakis' erroneouslya fabric composition substituted for a 'color') pants, and the red shirt of Target or the navy blue shirt of Wal-Mart. Wear them, and the little name tag, and give half of what you make to the governmentand allow them to craft your livesas you obey. Once again, the 'Benjamin Martin' character in 'The Patriot' portrayed by Mel Gibsonthat character's lines were correct: 'An elected legislature can trample a man's rights as easily as a king.' They are coming for the guns. They are marching forward with their legislation, to provide 'legitimacy' for their actions 'under the color of law.' Their doorkickers are 'ass-kickers,' in good shape and sharp reflexes with good mental acumen. They are 'psychologically protected' to allow them to act with full force without restraint: protected with direct deposit of their check, protected with life insurance, and protected with healthcare for their familiesall of their basics taken care of, plus a badge: they're covered, when they come for the citizens. The last step for a full-blown tyranny before the actual collapse (political, military, economic, or a combination thereof) is evident in the tyrannical measures and inflictions they foster against their own populace.[98]  Report: Elon Musk Weed Stuff Prompts NASA Probe of SpaceX 'Workplace Safety'[99] According to the Washington Post, NASA will launch an extensive 'safety review' of SpaceX and Boeing, assessing the culture of the two private companies tapped to fly the agency's astronauts. Citing three unnamed officials, the newspaper reports that the review was provoked by SpaceX CEO Elon Musk's actions—specifically, yes, the weed stuff.[100]  Report: FBI Classifies Far-Right Proud Boys as 'Extremist, ' Linked to White Nationalism[101] The FBI considers the far-right hate group the Proud Boys 'an extremist group with ties to White Nationalism,' according to a report from a Washington State sheriff's office. The designation appeared in an August internal affairs report from the Clark County Sheriff's Office in Vancouver, posted online Monday by the government transparency non-profit Property of the People.[102]  Trump Supporters Attacked by Crazed Leftist During CNN Protest[103] Culprit denies attacking group despite it being caught on camera A new video shows a crazed leftist assaulting a group of Trump supporters during a protest outside CNN's headquarters in Atlanta on Saturday. The clip shows Trump supporters standing near an intersection holding protest signs demonstrating against 'fake news'. Some are holding Trump flags while another is holding an American flag. A young man is then seen running across the road towards the group while flailing his fists.[104]  UN Attacks Converging on 1st ...d Amendments[105] Globalists move to overstep US Constitution The UN Migration Treaty has been rejected by the U.S., Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, and others are expected to follow. So the UN is now pushing for international law, criminalizing any country that disagrees with their open borders.[106]  Voters Electing Democrats Who Despise Them[107] Kyrsten Sinema might not be able to stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue, shoot someone, and lose no support, but she could and did insult the very voters she was trying to woo and be the next duly-elected senator from the Copper State. The former Green Party gadfly and 9th Congressional District Representative has at last been declared the winner of Jeff Flake's departed Senate seat. She's the first Arizona Democrat to win a Senate election in 30 years. She's also the first high-profile politician that I know who spent decades mocking her own constituents as drug-addled nincompoops, only to, in the end, receive their backing. Sinema's record of contempt for her own people is nonpareil. The way she openly and endlessly complains about the loons in her state is akin to an elderly crank who never stops complaining about the one time the cable company once tried to upcharge him for Showtime. On multiple occasions, Sinema has referred to her home state as 'crazy,' a 'meth lab for democracy,' and an accursed place no good ever emerges from. Not once, it seems, did she ever stop to think how this obloquy reflects on her: an Arizonan, after all. One is reminded of Flaubert's classic quote: 'By dint of railing at idiots, one runs the risk of becoming an idiot oneself.' Despite her best attempts to shower voters with disdain, Sinema defeated her opponent, Martha McSally, a decorated war pilot with the distinction of being the first woman to ever fly a U.S. Air Force combat mission. Perhaps the self-loathing Arizonan was right this whole time: Arizonans went with the pink-tutu accoutered Taliban sympathizer over a distinguished veteran. Quite a fine accomplishment for a state previously represented by the late John McCain. [Comment: Bottom line now the veneer has come off and Democrat ugliness is being revealed everywhere never, ever vote for a Democrat (ie Communist).][108]  Watch: Female Antifa Member Allegedly Spits on, Punches Conservative Activist[109] Police arrested a 19-year-old Antifa protester Saturday for allegedly punching and spitting on conservative activists taking part in the #HimToo rally in Portland, Oregon. Authorities arrested left-wing Antifa protester Hannah McClintock on a harassment charge, and arrested five others on other charges, including interfering with a peace officer and disorderly conduct, the Portland Police Bureau said in a statement.[110]  'Allahu Akbar': Brussels Policeman Stabbed in Neck as France's Macron Visits City[111] A police officer was stabbed in the neck in front of Brussels' main police station on Tuesday morning — with claims the attacker was an Islamist shouting 'Allahu Akbar.' The attack took place on the second day of a state visit to Belgium by French President Emmanuel Macron, and shortly before he is due to visit the infamous terror-linked neighbourhood of Molenbeek. The police officer is said to be in a stable condition and his injuries are not life-threatening.[112]  Allahu Akbar Shouting Man Stabs Police Officer in the Neck in Brussels — Authorities Say 'Motive Unknown'[113] A Brussels policeman was attacked this morning by a man with a knife. This happened at 5.30 am in front of the police station in the center of Brussels. 'The police officer is injured, but not in danger,' police spokeswoman Ilse Van de Keere confirms. For the time being, no terrorist motive is assumed.[114]  As Christmas Looms, ISIS Again Threatens Attack on Pope Francis[115] A pro-ISIS media group has threatened to attack Pope Francis as Christians around the world gear up to celebrate the birth of Christ. Al-Abd Al-Faqir made the threat in a new propaganda poster showing a handgun being pointed at the Pope. It carries the slogan 'Don't think you are away from our attacks'.[116]  Breaking: Tommy Robinson Organising Mass Rally Against Brexit Betrayal[117] Tommy Robinson has announced that he is organising a mass rally against Theresa May's betrayal of Brexit.

Mr Marsh suggested the police could no longer be the bulwark between order and criminality without public assistance, saying on BBC Radio 4: 'We don't come to work to get assaulted, and if we're not going to be backed upthen what is the point?'[120]  Brussels Unveils EU Army Plans for Spy School, Missile Development[121] The European Union has agreed to a series of armament and military projects including a spy school and medium-range missile development as part of its proto-EU army force PESCO. Late Monday, foreign and defence ministers from 25 countries agreed at the Council of the European Union on the 17 projects under the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) initiative, which was adopted by the bloc in December 2017.[122]  Corbyn: Labour Will Stop Britain Fully Leaving European Union on WTO Brexit Terms[123] British opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn says his party will try to stop Britain leaving the European Union without an agreement if Prime Minister Theresa May's divorce deal is rejected by Parliament. Corbyn, leader of the Labour Party, said in a speech to the Confederation of British Industry that 'neither the Cabinet nor Parliament would endorse such an extreme and frankly dangerous course.' He said 'Labour will not countenance a no-deal Brexit,' which could cause upheaval for businesses and people. But it is unclear what would happen if Parliament rejected the deal when it is put to a vote, likely next month. Corbyn said the proposed agreement is 'a botched, worst-of-all-worlds deal which is bad for Britain.' Labour is calling for Britain to stay in a customs union with the EU and to have a 'strong' relationship with the bloc's single market. Critics say that's a vague and unachievable goal.[124]  De-Platforming: UKIP Supporters Banned From PayPal[125] Following on from Tommy Robinson being banned from Paypal, UKIP have issued a statement saying that the Party has received reports from its members and donors that they have been banned from Paypal for no good reason. Susan Smith said that she received an email from Paypal asking her if she held political office to which she replied that she does not. She was then asked for proof of address but given no clear instructions where to send this and then she received notification her account had been suspended. Other Party members told her they had the same experience. Gerard Batten MEP, UKIP Leader, slammed the 'nakedly political' actions of Paypal. He pointed out that it was never those who support open borders or the politically correct establishment that have their accounts closed. Closing peoples accounts is 'simply wrong' he insisted as many people use the service to pay their bills etc: 'I will be writing tothe head of Paypal for an explanation of why these accountshave been shut down.'[126]  Dog Accused of 'Racist Hate Crime' In Bonkers Britain[127] A dog has been accused of a racially aggravated hate crime after it fouled on the front of a property in the latest of bewildering incidents in Britain. The so called 'victim' dialled 999 and said the dog had done this in a racist attack. It comes amid a spate of incidents including mail being 'deliberately opened and resealed', and another canine barking at a person in the street.[128]  EU Wants More Concessions: France Demands Fishing Rights and Spain Calls for Gibraltar Veto[129] France is leading a push to demand the European Union issue a hardline declaration on the bloc's interpretation of Theresa May's proposed withdrawal agreement, covering issues including fishing.[130]  Far Left Militias Try to Break Up Peaceful Right Wing Vox Party Rally in Catalonia, Spain[131] Last Sunday in Tarragona, Spain, there was a peaceful rally by the right wing populist party VOX, which is strongly opposed to separatist regional governments and the new wave of illegal immigration.

The suspected jihadists were placed in pre-trial detention over the weekend after being officially charged with 'conspiracy to commit a terrorist act' on the first day of nationwide demonstrations against higher fuel taxes and President Emmanuel Macron's economic policies. Three of the suspects were arrested near the southeastern French town of Lyon last Tuesday, an anonymous police source told the daily. Two of the men are brothers aged 23 and 35 who are known to police as 'radicalised', according to newspaper Le Parisien.[134]  France, Germany Vow to Push on With Plans to Curb National Sovereignty in Eurozone[135] France and Germany have vowed to push forward with plans to curb national sovereignty on financial matters in the eurozone, with ministers from the 19 countries set to enter talks in the coming days on creating a common budget.[136]  French Prosecutors Open Inquiry Into Macron Campaign Financing[137] PARIS (AFP) — Paris prosecutors have launched an inquiry into the origins of thousands of euros donated to President Emmanuel Macron's election campaign last year, a legal source told AFP on Tuesday. The move follows an alert from France's campaign finance oversight body this month, after it was unable to determine the sources of a total of 144,000 euros ($164,000) given to Macron's Republic on the Move (LREM) movement. The funds were contributed via checks, bank transfers or electronic payments, the source said, confirming a report on Europe 1 radio. [138]  Globalist Merkel Ally to UK: 'Take Your Bad Brexit Deal or Leave it — Negotiations Are Over'[139] A senior German MP and longtime ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel has insisted there is 'no question' that the 'bad' Brexit deal offered by Brussels could be renegotiated. Chairman of the Bundestag's foreign affairs committee, Norbert Röttgen, stated that the German government 'do[es] not see any space for further negotiation or renegotiation' regarding Prime Minister Theresa May's super-soft Brexit agreement, which has been panned by Eurosceptics. 'We are convinced that the deal has now been struck. I personally consider this to be the best of all the bad deals one could negotiate. Now it is for both sides to decide whether to take it or leave it. The negotiations are over,' The Times reported the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) figure saying.[140]  Hungarian Government Pressed for Answers About Gruevski[141] Speaking at a press conference in Brussels, Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto reiterated that former Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski entered Hungary fully legally.

'I stand with the incinerators,' said the head of the big business group. He said he was amazed that the M5S, which is 'in favour of reducing waste in spending, does not realise we are putting rubbish on ships, we're sending it to other countries where they use incinerators, and we are paying for this'. M5S leader Luigi Di Maio has squashed League leader Matteo Salvini's call for incinerators across Campania and especially in its Land of Fires area where toxic waste arson fires are a major problem.[144]  Italy: Demolition of Eight Rome Casamonica-Clan Villas Begins[145] End of 30 years of disrespect for the law says Rome Mayor Raggi (ANSA) — Rome, November 30 — Authorities in Rome started the demolition of eight illegally built villas belonging to members of the Casamonica criminal clan early on Tuesday.

Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May is due to sign a treaty with EU leaders to leave the bloc on Sunday, but Spain's warning over the contested British territory on Spain's southern tip may add another complication.

[156]  Swedish Men Sterilising Themselves Up 70 Percent in Five Years[157] Since 2013, there has been a 70 per cent increase in Swedish men seeking voluntary vasectomies, according to a report.

In 2010, a Saudi lawyer named Faisal Yamani wrote to the Danish newspapers that had published cartoons of Islam's prophet, Mohammed. Claiming to act on behalf of 95,000 descendants of Mohammed, the Saudi lawyer said that the cartoons were defamatory and that legal proceedings would thereby begin. However, everything about the supposed legal claim reeked. How had Mr Yamani located all these descendants? How had he come up with exactly 95,000 of them? And how could you claim that a statement about somebody who died 1,400 years ago was 'defamatory'? Legally, one cannot 'defame' the dead.[160]  UK: 'We're Seeing From the Government a Deliberate Decision Not to Deliver a Proper Brexit' — Rees-Mogg[161] The deal she always wanted — Theresa May. Jacob Rees-Mogg has said what all of the 17.4 million Leave voters already know. Mrs. 'Treason' May's #BrexitNotBrexit#RemainersBrexit is not actually Brexit. The UK is not leaving the Customs Union, free movement will continue, and we will not have a say over our own trade deals.[162]  UK: Defiant Parents Who Took Daughter, Seven, On 3,000 Honeymoon to New York in Term Time Then Refused to Pay 60 Fine Could Still be Jailed if They Don't Accept Caution[163] A newlywed couple who took their seven-year-old daughter out of school in term time for a 3,000 honeymoon to New York could still be jailed unless they accept a caution offered to them today by magistrates. Janine and Shane Scott took Elissa to the Big Apple for five days without asking permission from the headteacher of St John the Baptist Church of England Primary School in Stockton-On-Tees, believing she would allow it under exceptional circumstances. But they arrived back home to find 60 fines which they refused to pay on principle. This landed them in Teeside Magistrates Court, where a representative of Stockton Council said she would accept a caution if they pleaded guilty.[164]  UK: DUP Refuse to Vote for Gov't Finance Bill in Response to May's Sellout Brexit Deal[165] Theresa May's deal with the DUP was officially ripped up last night as her 1bn 'confidence and supply' deal with Northern Irish MPs came crashing down. They accused the Prime Minister of breaking a fundamental promise on Brexit. The party joined with Labour to cut the Government's majority to just five in a Commons vote on the Budget. They also abstained on a series of other amendments to the Finance Bill on Monday night in a move intended to send a 'political message' to Prime Minister.[166]  UK: Hartlepool: The Town Where 'Police Don't Come Out'[167] After eight years of spending cuts affecting public services, the government has said austerity is coming to an end. But what has the effect of less money been on local communities? The BBC has been following officers in one of England's poorest towns to investigate how budget cuts impact police on the front line. Cleveland Police cover the districts of Hartlepool, Redcar and Cleveland, Stockton and Middlesbrough — all in the North East.[168][169]  UK: Jacob Rees-Mogg's Brexit Group Publishes Full Brexit Antidote to Theresa May's Betrayal Deal[170] Rebel backbench leader Jacob Rees-Mogg and resigned Brexit secretary David Davis presented a paper addressing the 'imagined' problems and roadblocks to Brexit Tuesday morning, which they said gives 'practical answers' on how to leave the European Union without surrendering sovereignty.

Bahram, during the usual Monday press conference, revealed that 'there are some ambiguities about the implementation of the EU mechanism to protect trade with Iran from American sanctions. But we remain confident that Europeans can save the agreement '. In recent months, the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Defense Policy of the European Union, Federica Mogherini announced the decision to establish a financial vehicle with which to circumvent the unilateral sanctions imposed in Teheran by the United States, called SPIRO (European Special Financial Mechanism). This Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) will function as the clearing house of a stock exchange, to allow Iran to continue to sell oil. The mechanism will not include the other signatories of the Iranian nuclear agreement, China and Russia, which will adopt their own payment mechanisms with Tehran. The United States, the 7 last August, started the first tranche of the sanctions imposed against Teheran, which concern companies that operate in the sectors of the commercialization of the dollar, gold, software for the management of industrial processes and various minerals. as graphite, raw metals and coal.

A Belgium-based defense contractor Luciad has sold the software to China, according to the South China Morning Post (SCMP) citing Chinese government sources. The software, which includes a Luciad Lightspeed application, is used to map the terrain and ensure situational awareness of military commanders. The software, which is in used by NATO and US militaries, visualizes changes in enemy positions and identifies targets in real time. It's 75 times faster than its closest competitor and is remarkably accurate. The same software is reportedly employed by US Special Operations Forces, whose raid on Osama bin Laden in Pakistan made headlines in 2011. Notably, a foreign company supplying software to the Chinese government must fully reveal its codes for a security check. But it's unclear if Luciad complied with the requirement. Much to the concern of the US military, China has made an array of remarkable breakthroughs in military hi-tech over the past years. Beijing heavily invested in advanced military technologies, nearly outpacing the Americans.[180]  North Korea Demolished 10 Guard Posts With Explosives, Seoul Says[181] Nov. 20 (UPI) — North Korea detonated 10 guard posts inside the demilitarized zone on Tuesday but left one guard post intact, as the two Koreas move forward to carry out agreements between Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in.[182]  Exclusive: 'There's No Such Thing as ISIS': Father of Two Alleged Terrorists Accused of Plotting a Massacre Makes Bold Claim and Says Western Countries Are 'The Killers'[183] Samad and Ertunc's father Armagan Eriklioglu told Daily Mail Australia his son was not only not inspired by ISIS, but the terror organisation did not exist.[184]  Melbourne's African Gang Crime Hot Spots Are Revealed — So is Your Suburb Safe?[185] Melbourne's western suburbs are particularly notorious for African gangs, with new figures showing a surge in the number of defendants born in Sudan.[186]  Three Charged Over Foiled 'Potentially Deadly' Terror Attack in Australia[187] Three would-be terrorists were arrested in Australia on Tuesday and face charges of planning a mass-casualty attack in Melbourne, the country's second-largest city.

Adopting the pact 'would risk encouraging illegal entry to Australia and reverse hard-won successes in combating the people-smuggling trade', Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in a joint statement with his home and foreign ministers. Morrison was an architect of Australia's hardline policy of detaining asylum-seekers trying to reach the country by boat on remote Pacific islands.

The ship is currently in Marseilles. The case regards the alleged dumping of dangerous and potentially infectious refuse, including medical materials, without the waste being separated, as if it were ordinary household waste. Prosecutors suspect that 24,000 kilos of waste was dumped in this way on 44 different occasions. The waste was alleged dumped in 11 ports — Trapani, Pozzallo, Augusta, Catania and Messina in Sicily; Vibo Valentia, Reggio Calabria and Corigliano Calabro in Calabria; Naples and Salerno in Campania; and Brindisi in Puglia. In total, 24 people are under investigation in the probe conducted by State and finance police and coordinated by Catania prosecutors, sources said. The authorities also requested the seizure of 460,000 euros. 'I was right to stop the NGOs' ships (landing in Italian ports),' Deputy Premier and Interior Minister Matteo Salvini said via Twitter. 'Not only did I stop the trafficking of migrants but, according to what has emerged, I stopped the trafficking of refuse too. #portichiusi (#portsclosed)'. MSF said that the Italian judicial authorities' request was a 'disproportionate and unfounded measure, purely aimed at criminalising lifesaving medical-humanitarian action at sea'. 'After two years of defamatory and unfounded allegations of collusion with human traffickers, judicial investigations, and bureaucratic obstacles against our humanitarian work, we are now accused of organised crime aimed at illicit waste trafficking,' said Karline Kleijer, MSF's head of emergencies. The NGO said the in-port operations, including waste management, of its search-and-rescue vessels had always followed standard procedures.[218]  Italy Orders Seizure of Migrant Transport Vessel Accused of Dumping Toxic Medical Waste[219] The Italian populist coalition government has ordered the seizure of the migrant transport ship Aquarius after accusing the NGO operating the vessel of dumping toxic materials potentially linked to diseases such as HIV and Tuberculosis.

In the commercial, Dion furtively enters a hospital maternity ward where she encounters a room full of children dressed according to their sex — blue for boys, pink for girls. After Dion blows a handful of black magic dust into the air, the babies' outfits magically transform into black and white Celinununu apparel, and the 'boy' and 'girl' symbols on the wall are converted into white crosses, the brand's logo.[230]  Hollywood Erases Hope[231] On November 9, a film with star power titled Boy Erased debuted. It's a direct attack on the idea that young people (or any) with unwanted same-sex desires are entitled to professional counseling. The cast includes Nicole Kidman and Russell Crowe, who play Christian parents who coerce their 19-year-old son into what the film calls a 'gay conversion therapy' program. Not surprisingly, the media are promoting the film. In a brief review, the Washington Post claimed that, 'by one estimate, nearly 700,000 Americans have been subjected to what's known as conversion therapy, a practice that attempts to change one's sexual orientation and — without evidence of efficacy — is still legal in 41 states.' Think they have an agenda? Why not frame it: 'In nine states, clients' constitutional rights have been violated by state laws preventing them from getting the professional counseling they need to help them recover their natural sexuality. And In 14 states, parents are barred from securing licensed reparative therapy for their children.' In his paper, 'Are Sexual Orientation Change Efforts (SOCE) Effective? Are They Harmful? What the Evidence Shows,' Family Research Council Senior Fellow for Policy Peter Sprigg summarizes: 'Critics of SOCE make two claims — that it is ineffective, and that it is harmful. Six studies or surveys from 2000 to 2018 are reviewed, all of which show that SOCE can be effective for some clients in bringing about significant change in some components of sexual orientation. Few harms were reported. Older reports, including 600 studies and five meta-analyses, showed the same. One widely-cited report on harms, with a sample selected for that purpose, offered almost entirely anecdotal rather than statistical evidence. These studies make clear that the evidence for the effectiveness of SOCE far outweighs the evidence of its harm.' ============  Go Ahead, Representative Swalwell: Make my Day Gun control advocates are tactically referring to this proposed effort as a 'buyback' for the same reason restauranteurs call the Patagonian toothfish a Chilean sea bass on their menus. A government 'buyback' of guns may sound much more palatable for the American public than a 'forcible government confiscation' of firearms, but it doesn't change the nature of the thing. The actual choice for Americans, under Swalwell's proposal, would be to 'sell' their guns to the government, surrender them with no recompense, or have the government forcibly confiscate them, with offenders facing prosecution or violence at the hands of government agents. This is, of course, not a choice at all, but it presents the veneer of choice, meant to hide the constitutional rights that would be stolen from American citizens. But what's most amazing about all of this is the ease with which the confiscation of heretofore-legal firearms from millions of Americans is being proposed in open forums today. It is, after all, impossibly illogical to conclude that such an action by the federal government would not be in direct violation of the Second Amendment.[232]  It's Official — Gender is Abolished in Australia as State Votes to Make it Optional to Put a Baby's Sex on the Birth Certificate — and Turncoat Liberal Speaker Made the Casting Vote[233] Tasmania has passed landmark transgender rights laws through the lower house which include parents having to 'opt in' to have a baby's sex recorded on birth certificates.[234]  Mentally Retarded Children Being Sterilized Under Trans Agenda[235] Watch the most censored and banned broadcast in the world and learn about the globalist plans for you and your family before it's too late Alex Jones breaks down the globalists' 'trans' agenda, which is meant in part to sterilize mentally ill children with hormone treatments.[236]  Shock Video: Kids Brainwashed to Hate White People[237] Social justice indoctrination camp Children as young as 5 and 6 brainwashed to hate white people and identify as different genders.

The former environment minister of Norway had been at the helm of the Nairobi-based UN Environment since June 2016. A UN audit found that Solheim had spent nearly $500,000 on travel and that he claimed unjustified expenses at a time when the world body is struggling with shrinking budgets.
