Q How is it done?
A The donor goes to a private room to produce a semen sample. An agent is added to the semen to reduce damage during freezing, and the sample is placed in several vials and frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Q Can it be collected at home?
A Sperm can be collected at home and placed in a mail-in kit. But it's better to do it at a laboratory where it can be processed immediately. Unless it's in a kit, it isn't usable for storage after about two hours.
Q How long can it be stored?
A If frozen, it can be stored virtually forever.
Q Who generally stores sperm?
A Men who plan to undergo chemotherapy, radiation and vasectomy or are at risk for diseases that might cause sterility, and donors who sell their sperm.
Q How many samples are needed?
A Experts generally advise three sessions, but if only one session is possible, analysis can show if enough viable sperm are present.
Q Is any preparation necessary?
A Lab workers take blood samples to screen for diseases. They also suggest that no sexual activity occur for several days before the sample is collected.
Q How much does it cost?
A Collecting and storing a sample costs around $250. Storing all the samples costs about $300 a year. Blood tests cost between $100 and $200.
