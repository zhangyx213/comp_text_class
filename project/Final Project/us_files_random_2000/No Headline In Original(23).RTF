Patrick, in his early fifties, was a very tall man with a reddish, open face, a pinched nose, and a thatch of brownish hair going white at the temples. He could not have been more polite or solicitous. Just as the program started, he turned to me and casually suggested the following: "Let me see your questions to make sure we don't duplicate each other." That sounded like a reasonable idea, so I handed over my list, which he scanned, nodding approvingly, and handed back with dispatch.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Was it a coincidence, or had Patrick purloined my work? Was I naive or paranoid? Was this guy for real or a self-serving phony? More than four years later, I'm still not sure, but I have never forgotten that day, and I have resurrected this incident here because I think the same is-he-for-real-or-is-he-a-phony question about Dan Patrick is about to be asked by members of the Texas Senate, to which he has just been elected and as a member of which his political future will be determined. The stakes, for him, are high: If, as a freshman senator with no previous experience in public office, he can really deliver on his promises--to curtail legalized abortion, to lower property taxes, to close the border to illegal immigrants, and, most precarious, to work with his fellow senators and the Republican leadership--he has a chance to position himself to reach his presumed, if implausible, goal: to be elected governor of Texas in 2010. But if he becomes a victim of his own darker impulses--self-aggrandizement, self-immolation, a bristling hostility toward those who disagree with him--Patrick will be forever remembered as just another rookie who went to Austin with dreams of playing in the big leagues but couldn't make the cut.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 In other words, if there were a program guide to Texas's eightieth legislative session, Dan Patrick would surely be the featured player. After three decades on the air and more than a few near-nuclear attacks on other politicians (including President George W. Bush and the Texas Republican leadership), the new state senator from Houston's northern and western suburbs is already causing nervous breakdowns of varying size and duration among other politicians from, as he likes to say, the Red River to the Nueces River--the supposed geographical reach of his daily talk radio program, the one originating from KSEV-AM, in Houston, and also heard on Patrick-owned KVCE-AM, in Dallas (he hopes to buy a San Antonio station as well). At 56, Patrick has long been known in Houston for a demeanor that can shift in a flash from angelic to aggrieved to outraged to breathtakingly narcissistic. Now he's bringing that road show to Austin, with the simultaneous ability (and inclination) to broadcast the sins of his colleagues to his intensely loyal band of listeners-turned-constituents.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Patrick isn't just any rookie, of course. He won his Republican primary, as he'd predicted, with just under 70 percent of the vote against three well-seasoned politicians whose conservative credentials were never in dispute--except by him, of course. It is a measure of Patrick's success that, almost immediately after he swept the primary, politicians, reporters, lobbyists, consultants, and just about everybody else with anything to do with Texas politics started talking about him, with trepidation and begrudging admiration, as a gubernatorial contender in four years. This with a radio station that has abysmal Arbitron ratings and, of course, without ever having served one day in public office.}

"Dan forces the party to face itself in a way it doesn't want to," Rice University political science professor Bob Stein told me. Patrick and his followers demand strict adherence to what he calls the Reagan conservative agenda, both social and economic. Hence, they stretch the fragile alliance between the genteel corporate Republicans and the edgier social conservatives to the snapping point. Even before taking office Patrick called for the institution of a "trigger bill" to instantly outlaw abortion in Texas if }

But he is just as vocal--if not more so--about the failings of his own party, many members of which, from Washington to Austin, he labels RINOs, as in "Republicans in name only." "There's a reason Perry is at thirty-six percent," Patrick said of the governor a few weeks before the election. "The base does not feel he has led in a conservative manner." About Bush, he has this to say: "While most Republicans support the president, they don't understand him turning his back on the border. And why is he spending as much as the Democrats did?"}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 The rout suffered by Republicans last November is, for Patrick, not a cause for mourning but another chance to say "I told you so"--something he's been doing for almost a year. "People wanted to deliver a message to the Republican leadership that we are off the conservative track and we need to get back on track," he says in an eminently reasonable but insistent tone on the radio, virtually every day. Government, he tells his audience, "is not listening to the people. You. People don't feel like anyone in Austin or Washington is really listening to them. They don't see anyone trying anymore on the GOP agenda."}

He wants the rate at which home appraisals can increase annually slashed from the current 10 percent to 3 percent. Who stands in his way? The lieutenant governor, who, as the Senate's presiding officer, will determine Patrick's committee assignments, the fate of his bills, and even whether he is formally recognized to speak. So what happens now? In order to get what he wants, does Patrick make nice with Dewhurst, whom he has regularly attacked on the air as a faux conservative? How can he explain that turnaround to his base? And what about Dewhurst? Does he relegate Patrick to the backbench, burying him on committees like Intergovernmental Relations or Agriculture? Won't that just rile the right wing he needs to win the Republican primary and prompt Patrick to play the martyr on the air? Or does Dewhurst get other senators to do his dirty work by proxy? ("He's not getting anything out of my committee" at least one of them has already asserted of Patrick.)}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Patrick's success or failure also hinges on the clubby nature of the Senate, an exclusive group of 31 members who treasure their rites and rituals with the solemnity and seriousness of the Vatican. Rule number one, of course, is that freshmen senators are seen and not heard. That will be hard, if not impossible, for Patrick to adhere to; in the past, he has shown no inclination for go-along, get-along politics. Patrick has also been highly critical of the fundamental procedure by which the Senate operates; known as the two-thirds rule, it is a tradition in which the regular order for considering bills is routinely ignored, and instead a senator wishing to pass a bill must ask his colleagues to suspend the rules to allow his bill to be heard out of order. This requires a two-thirds vote, or 21 of the 31 senators. Thus, 11 of the 31 can block legislation by voting against suspending the rules, in which case the bill dies without the public's knowing how senators would have voted. Senators who can't build coalitions can't succeed either way.}

Not coincidentally, this was the fate of the attempt in 2003 to lower appraisal caps. Dewhurst told him in an on-air interview that supporters of lowering the cap didn't have even 10 votes, much less the 21 necessary to bring the legislation to the floor. Patrick asked Dewhurst for the names of the senators who did not want to debate the bill, but Dewhurst demurred, saying he didn't have a list, and Patrick's pet issue disappeared without senators' going on record for or against. He has attacked Dewhurst and the other senators who opposed him on the air ever since.}

"The thing Austin hasn't figured out about me is that I don't care. I don't care about committee assignments. I don't care about getting my name on a bill. Austin doesn't really have anything I want. That gives me great freedom."

Whitmire's attack, he said, "was on me and you. Because when I'm attacked, you're attacked. It's not an attack on me, it's an attack on you." Before long he was turning Whitmire's influence and seniority into a negative: "Apparently he's one of those old-line politicians who is afraid of change ... There are going to be a handful of people up there who are trying to deny your voice by denying me ... If they want to force us to the outside, I know how to navigate from the outside.

Then he jumped back into the fray: "They need to understand that business as usual in Austin is over. So, Senator Whitmire, I forgive you--but how 'bout returning my phone call?" (Whitmire admitted that he hasn't been in a hurry to call him back. Patrick counters that Whitmire is "one senator" who hasn't welcomed him to the Senate.) "And you know," Patrick said, with a wistful chuckle, "look, I'm not mad with John. It's ... sad." His emotions changed with each missive. Happy: "This is why the radio station gives us great leverage, folks! We have a platform. We have a seat at the table!

"As long as they vote as a bloc, the Democrats will take them for granted and the Republicans will ignore them." He swaddles his border baiting in concern for Hispanic Americans. Thus, he will say on the radio, "We are going to be overrun by the masses coming here. By 2050 we could have over one hundred million people with no sense of our history, no sense of our culture, no sense of our language ... Your property taxes will never go down as long as a fourteen-year-old can show up at the schoolhouse and we pay ... And that student is destined to drop out anyway." But then he adds, "I do not want to see racism raise its ugly head in America again. If we do not solve this [border] problem, there will be resentment in America."}

Ninety percent of them are white. "Minorities don't listen to talk radio. Young women under forty aren't listening," he told me. "The nature of the audience tends to be conservative and Republican."

There wasn't a lot of money; Dannie Goeb's childhood home, in the late fifties and early sixties, was in a blue-collar part of East Baltimore. Patrick often tears up or gets a quiver in his voice when he talks about his father, who died in 2002. He remembers his sticking up for people in the neighborhood who had less; once the elder Goeb called on a state representative when he couldn't solve a problem himself. "I realize that I'm the guy people look up to, but in my family, I'm the least of any of them," Patrick told me. There are lines to read between here; an idealized father, a family limited by economics and education.

For a while the business thrived, largely on the strength of Patrick's personality, but he soon fell prey to the same financial lunacy that infected so many Houstonians in the early eighties. He bought another bar and restaurant, and then another, expanding, finally, to five. Then the oil bust hit, and in short order the man who had made $100,000 as a sportscaster closed four of his businesses, declared bankruptcy, and watched his annual income plummet to $10,000.

Ever resourceful, Patrick built a studio in his surviving bar and started a sports talk show, selling ads to make ends meet. At first he had to recruit customers to call in from the pay phone. Eventually he got a break: The shareholders of the station were suing the owner, a Tomball podiatrist, and the station was in danger of going dark. Patrick cut a deal: He persuaded the doctor to sell the station for the price of the remaining debt owed. At the same time, he talked the shareholders into dropping the lawsuit in exchange for 50 percent of his earnings. Patrick began to run the place in 1988. Six months later, an unknown conservative New York talk show host contacted him about getting on the air; two bigger local stations had already turned him down. Patrick needed voices to fill long hours of empty airtime, and so he decided to put on Rush Limbaugh. It was a business decision, not a political one--Patrick had no thought of running for office then--but the show was a hit, and so was KSEV.}

Patrick was allowed to stay on, and he continued to air the issue-oriented show he had been doing since 1992. However, his on-air enthusiasm for Christianity and conservative politics made Clear Channel uncomfortable. Asked to limit both topics, Patrick resisted for years, and in 2000 he resigned. He worked briefly as station manager for Joel Osteen, who was then running his late father's TV ministry, before he got the news that his old station KSEV was being sold to a California company, Liberman Broadcasting. Liberman offered him an arrangement that allowed Patrick to return to the airwaves and grow richer by the minute: He could lease airtime while keeping much of the advertising revenue for himself and his partners. It was a great deal for Patrick.}

He recounts this story frequently, putting himself, as he often does, in the role of savior when, as he tells it, he stood up to the lobby-corrupted government in the Capitol and demanded that he and his supporters be heard on the issue of appraisal caps. In 1997 the Legislature had passed a law that property appraisals couldn't rise more than 10 percent in a given year. To Patrick the cap was too high; by his calculations, if the values continued to rise at that rate, working people would soon be priced out of their homes. He wanted the increases capped at 3 percent per year. When a hearing on the measure was scheduled in the House of Representatives, Patrick brought several busloads of angry supporters to Austin.}

Hill believed that lowering appraisal caps would unfairly punish the poor and would eventually so starve municipalities that a state income tax would be necessary. Dropping the caps to 3 percent, he believed, could create in Texas the municipal ills that had devastated California in the wake of Proposition 13. "What you're doing is giving a tax break to people in upscale homes," he told me. The burden would fall on apartment dwellers, small-business owners, and middle-class homeowners. "We will become like California," Hill continued. "Local communities cannot raise the revenue they need because of all the restrictions put on them."

Patrick would later claim that his people were kept waiting on purpose and that other witnesses, who opposed lowering the caps (including paid lobbyists), were called to testify about the caps before his supporters were allowed to speak. After two and a half more hours, Patrick began screaming furiously at state representative Glenn Hegar, of Houston, swearing that he would make sure Hegar was not reelected; Hill says--and Patrick denies--that Patrick later told him that he could elect or defeat anyone in Harris County. (Not only was Hegar reelected, but this year he, like Patrick, won election to the Senate.) Knowing that Patrick had a tendency to grandstand, Hill had earlier asked that a state trooper be present for the hearing. When the trooper took his only break of the afternoon, Patrick began screaming that Hill "should be ashamed to call himself a Republican" while his supporters keened in the background. The trooper returned and Patrick and his group walked out, but he subsequently returned and testified for almost half an hour.}

Few days have passed since then without an enemy-of-all-true-conservatives mention of Hill by Patrick on the air. (Patrick purchased a radio station in Dallas in fall 2006; Hill's constituents can now get the word locally.) In turn, Hill's office is regularly flooded with hate mail. "Patrick demonizes everybody who disagrees with him," Hill said. "My problem is that I cannot respond to all the people he has misled. I don't have a radio station." Patrick has also suggested since that blowup that if Dewhurst doesn't move to the right, his chances of becoming the next governor of Texas will be doomed.}

"I just didn't feel at peace about it," he said. "I got serious about my faith in the mid-nineties, and I know intuitively if I'm supposed to be doing something." By the time Jon Lindsay decided in 2005 to retire as the senator representing the Seventh District, most of which lies outside the Houston city limits, Patrick was a lot more at peace about running.

Even though Patrick wasn't supposed to be on the radio--he put his son, Ryan, in charge after he began running in earnest--Patrick would call in occasionally for remote chats, taking the opportunity, for instance, to label Nixon a RINO (with no regard for reality; in fact, Nixon had been a standard-bearer for the conservative agenda--on tort reform, lower taxes, you name it--since first getting elected in 1994). "His opponents did not comprehend the dynamics of talk radio, the media, and the Internet" is the way Dave Walden, a longtime Houston political operative, put it.

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 The general election posed no problem, as Harris County Democrats had written off the district. In fact, Patrick's opponent, Michael Kubosh, was a Republican who registered as a Democrat simply out of disgust for his own party's abandonment of its far right wing. He looked like a fringe candidate; heavyset, with white hair and a carefully trimmed white beard, he was sort of a Santa Claus for conservatives. After Patrick won his primary in March, Kubosh signed a waiver with the FCC freeing Patrick from giving Kubosh equal time on his station and thus allowing Patrick back on the air. The two men got on so famously that in May of 2006 Kubosh became a $580,000 investor in Patrick's Dallas radio station. At the very least, Patrick saved a small fortune by not having a real Democratic opponent in the race. Kubosh hopes for the best when Patrick goes to Austin but knows there are pitfalls ahead. "There are lots of demons out there," he told me. "Some of them have money in their pockets and some of them have short skirts. But I believe if Dan does the right thing, maybe in eight years he will be the governor."}

One lobbyist spoke to the hopes of many when he predicted: "Dan is going to get repeatedly taken to the woodshed." Not surprisingly, Patrick disagrees. He points out that he has already engaged in several meet and greets with senators and lobbyists, trying to calm their fears, and is eager and willing to work with the leadership despite his nearly constant on-air criticism. "My whole life I've had plenty of attention," he told me. "As far as influence and power, that's nothing new. And the fact that ninety percent of my money came from citizens--I don't owe anything to anyone. I'm going there just to legislate. I'm going to be a leader."}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Maybe so. But what's calmed legislators most is that, after branding Nixon as the candidate of special interests, Patrick proceeded to open his door to some special interests of his own. The postelection contributions to his campaign look like the Late Train Lobby Express, with those onboard including insurance companies, hospitals, police, beverage distributors, optometrists, restaurateurs, Friends of Time Warner Cable, and, of course, GOP megadonors Bob Perry and James Leininger.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Patrick will have other problems as he makes the transition from talk show host to legislator to, perhaps, gubernatorial candidate. The skill set is different--working alone versus playing well with others, something he's never excelled at. His radio harangues against those who toil in the Capitol have raised the expectations of his supporters, and he's led them to expect change overnight. Patrick could try to maintain his outsider status with interminable filibusters, but that will take him only so far. "It will bother Dan that he won't be able to get things done in the Senate," one lobbyist told me. But getting things done will require the kind of horse trading he has so often criticized. To get anything done Patrick has to work with the leadership. Meanwhile, his fans will be demanding red meat.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Which, of course, raises the question of Patrick's ultimate goals and how he intends to achieve them. He believes that the GOP's failure last November occurred because the party had moved too far from its conservative roots, refusing to act aggressively on illegal immigration, abortion, and reducing spending and taxes. If Patrick doesn't see change on the issues that matter to his constituents, he says, he will try to propel himself higher up the political ladder, perhaps to the governorship. "I'm keeping my options open," he told me. "If this party gets back on track and a good conservative emerges..." He shrugged off that scenario and then added, "If this party doesn't get back on the conservative path, then we have to evaluate where we are."}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Clearly, he's already done a lot of evaluating. A few weeks before the election, for instance, Rick Perry came to Houston and enlisted Patrick in an event to inspire the Republican base. (After the election, Patrick would declare that his party's success in Harris County was all due to KSEV's get-out-the-vote efforts. "We urged our voters to lead the state in turnout, and it appears Perry did better in Senate Seven than almost anywhere else," he said. "So maybe Austin needs to think about embracing the conservative principles of KSEV and their listeners, because it looks like that was the only key to success on election night.")}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 The venue was a small storefront in District Seven, right off busy FM 1960. The crowd was mostly bused-in schoolkids and drawn, elderly women with tight white perms and men with sagging bellies and sun-worn faces. I'd seen them before, at a barbecue for Patrick north of town; they'd come out for him in a driving rain, proud of their activism and adoring of their candidate. Most of them lived not in the enormous new McMansions spreading almost to Katy--though some did--but in the small slab houses built amid the pines thirty or forty years ago. The group reminded me in mood and appearance of an East Texas church supper in the early sixties. They didn't evoke Ronald Reagan as much as Barry Goldwater.}
