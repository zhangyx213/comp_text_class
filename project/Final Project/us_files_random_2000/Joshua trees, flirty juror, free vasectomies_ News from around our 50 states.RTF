The U.S. Department of Justice, in a news release, said the state\u8217 s foster care program has illegally placed hundreds of students with disabilities into \u8220 segregated and inferior educational programs,\u8221  a direct violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. \u8220 Students with disabilities in Alabama\u8217 s foster care system are among the most vulnerable in the state\u8217 s care, and they deserve better than placement in segregated and inferior schools,\u8221  Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke, of the department\u8217 s Civil Rights Division, said in a statement. \u8220 The Civil Rights Division will defend every child\u8217 s right to equal educational opportunities in schools where they can be supported and challenged.\u8221  The department\u8217 s findings follow an investigation into allegations that the state denies children in foster care equal opportunity to basic educational services on the basis of disability. Gina Maiola, communications director for Gov. Kay Ivey, said in a statement that the Alabama State Department of Education and the Department of Human Resources have been \u8220 working proactively since 2018 to address the needs of our specialized treatment centers.\u8221 }

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Anchorage: Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy has indicated he will vote in favor of calling a convention to consider amending the state\u8217 s constitution. Candidates for governor at an Alaska Resource Development Council forum Tuesday were asked during a \u8220 lightning round\u8221  if they would be voting for a constitutional convention in next month\u8217 s general election. Candidates responded by raising \u8220 yes\u8221  or \u8220 no\u8221  signs, the Anchorage Daily News reports. Dunleavy and Republican Charlie Pierce raised \u8220 yes\u8221  signs. Former Gov. Bill Walker, an independent, and Les Gara, a Democrat, raised \u8220 no\u8221  signs. Voters are asked every 10 years if there should be a constitutional convention. While the question has in the past been soundly defeated, both sides of the debate have been preparing for a fight this year. Some convention supporters see an opening to push for one amid public frustration with years of political fighting over what size check should be paid to residents from Alaska\u8217 s oil-wealth fund. During a convention, delegates typically have free reign to propose revisions \u8211  or even entirely new constitutions \u8211  that would then go back to voters for ratification. Some of those pursuing a convention would like to restrict abortion or alter the process for selecting judges in a way that critics say could make the process more partisan.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Phoenix: The state can move forward with the execution of death row inmate Murray Hooper next month, the Arizona Supreme Court ruled Wednesday. The high court granted the motion for a warrant of execution of the 76-year-old. He will die by lethal injection or gas in an execution scheduled for Nov. 16, according to the warrant signed by four justices. The other three recused themselves. Kelly Culshaw, an assistant federal public defender representing Hooper, reiterated that he has maintained his innocence in the double slayings on New Year\u8217 s Eve in 1980. Hooper was convicted and sentenced \u8220 based on corrupt police practices and unreliable witness testimony,\u8221  Culshaw said in a statement. \u8220 No physical evidence links him to the crime and Mr. Hooper\u8217 s execution should not be carried out until an analysis of key fingerprint and DNA evidence, which was scientifically unavailable at the time of his trial, has been completed,\u8221  she wrote. Hooper\u8217 s defense team filed a petition in September in Maricopa County Superior Court requesting post-conviction DNA and other forensic testing. Defense attorneys say a witness\u8217 s description of the assailants changed several times before she identified Hooper, who claimed not to be in Arizona at the time. They also allege criminal informants who helped implicate Hooper were influenced by incentives from the police.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Sacramento: The state again pushed back its decision on whether to list the western Joshua tree as threatened after a unanimous vote Wednesday by the Fish and Game Commission. The decision to move back the vote until at least February comes months after the commission deadlocked on whether the native desert plant should be protected under the California Endangered Species Act. Since the tree is still under consideration to be listed as threatened, no one can remove it without authorization from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. Before the commission\u8217 s split vote in June, the Department of Fish and Wildlife sent letters to Indigenous tribes with traditional ties to the area where the western Joshua trees live. That outreach resulted in six responses from tribal nations, said Director Chuck Bonham. In August, tribal members talked about the cultural and ecological significance of the tree on a Zoom call with Bonham and others. \u8220 I actually would love more time to keep the conversation alive with the nations themselves,\u8221  Bonham said. In 2019, the Center for Biological Diversity petitioned for the tree to be listed as threatened in order to protect it from hotter temperatures, intensifying drought and development threats. Commissioners said they need more time to hear from tribal leaders and to allow tribal governments to consult again before the commission can make a final decision.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Leadville: A Utah-based Native American tribe that frequently has sparred with President Joe Biden criticized the White House again for not adequately consulting its leaders ahead of this week\u8217 s creation of a national monument on ancestral lands in Colorado. The Ute Indian Tribe is one of three Ute tribes in the West that share ancestral ties but operate independently. Representatives from the other two in Colorado \u8211  the Southern Ute and Ute Mountain Ute \u8211  were on board with the plan and attended Wednesday\u8217 s ceremony with Biden but didn\u8217 t speak on stage. Biden and others addressed the significance of the land to tribes at length, and the White House\u8217 s official proclamation included a mention of Ute burial sites in the area. But the Ute Indian Tribe, which has nearly 3,000 members on lands in an area known for oil and gas operations in eastern Utah, claimed in a news release late Wednesday that it wasn\u8217 t on board with the plan. The tribe\u8217 s Business Committee, which serves as its governing body, said in the statement it was made aware of the new monument only a few days ago in a phone call with the White House, given scant details and little time to provide feedback. Melvin J. Baker, chairman of the Southern Ute Indian Tribal Council, noted that for centuries, the Camp Hale area was home to Ute people, and it remains culturally important to the Utes.}

A third officer was wounded in the gunfire. State police said in a release that the 911 call the night prior about a dispute between two siblings appears to have been \u8220 a deliberate act to lure law enforcement to the scene\u8221  in Bristol. Bristol Police Sgt. Dustin Demonte and Officer Alex Hamzy were killed. Officer Alec Iurato was injured.

The surviving brother, 32, was hospitalized, and it wasn\u8217 t immediately clear whether he or his family had an attorney or someone else who can speak for them. The deadly encounter came during a week when at least 11 police officers have been shot around the country. Connecticut State Police said they were still working to answer many questions that remained about the confrontation. Neighbors said they heard two or three sets of gunshots, about 30 in all. \u8220 I heard a whole war going on behind me,\u8221  said Danny Rodriguez, who said he was outside his home across the street when the gunfire rang out. It was so intense that he could smell gunpowder in the air, he said.}

As part of the ongoing \u8220 Restore the Corridor\u8221  project, the highway will be closed between the U.S. Route 202 and the Second Street on-ramp from 9 a.m. Friday until 5 a.m. Tuesday.

All local traffic will be directed to exit I-95 onto U.S. Route 202 and then to take Delaware Route 141 south back onto I-95. Delays and heavier traffic are expected around all detours. By closing part of the highway, construction workers can pave and strip the road, install lighting and build guardrails more safely and quickly. And while it may inconvenience drivers, Department of Transportation spokesperson C.R. McLeod said the road closure represents the \u8220 final stretch of major work.\u8221  Construction on I-95 in Wilmington, which has been ongoing since early 2021, is slated to wrap up by the end of this year, which is earlier than expected. \u8220 The end is within sight,\u8221  McLeod said.

Superior Court on Thursday against chemical manufacturer Velsicol Chemical LLC, claiming it violated city environmental laws by polluting a major waterway, the Anacostia River and the surrounding area for decades. In a complaint filed by D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine, the city alleges that Velsicol produced a pesticide that contained chlordane and marketed it to low-income homeowners in the city from 1945 to 1988. That was the year the chemical was banned for sale in the U.S. by the Environmental Protection Agency over health effects in humans, including tremors, convulsions and cancer. But Racine claimed at a press conference that Velsicol knew long before that that chlordane could cause cancer, as far back as 1959, yet still sold products that contained the chemical. Velsicol did not immediately return calls for comment. As recently as the 1960s, D.C. residents used the Anacostia River for recreation and food, but years of pollution from a variety of sources \u8211  sewage, chemical runoff and litter \u8211  made the river unusable. The lawsuit developed out of a decades\'adlong effort to clean up the river, Racine said. Local environmentalists, like Matt Gravatt, chair of the D.C. chapter of the Sierra Club, said the river is almost back to being safe for public use, but not yet.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Tallahassee: Gov. Ron DeSantis on Thursday issued an executive order expanding voting access for the midterm elections in three counties where Hurricane Ian destroyed polling places and displaced thousands of people. The move, which followed requests from Lee, Charlotte and Sarasota counties and voting rights groups, comes as Florida begins to undertake a massive recovery from the Category 4 hurricane that hit Sept. 28 and leveled parts of the state\u8217 s southwest. The order extends the number of early voting days in the three counties and authorizes election supervisors to designate additional early voting locations, steps that allow voters to cast ballots at any polling place in their registered county from Oct. 24 through Nov. 8. Election supervisors can relocate or consolidate polling places if necessary. The order also waives training requirements for poll workers and suspends a signature requirement for voters requesting to have a mail ballot sent to an address different from the one election officials have on file. DeSantis has faced questions over what steps he would take to ensure voting access in the heavily damaged southwest part of the state, which has leaned conservative in recent elections. The Republican governor, who is up for reelection, has made tightening election laws a top priority over the past two years as he and others in the GOP reacted to ex-President Donald Trump\u8217 s baseless claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 presidential election.}

Now a jury must decide whether he violated the men\u8217 s civil rights. A federal grand jury in April 2021 indicted Clayton County Sheriff Victor Hill, saying he violated the civil rights of four people in his custody. Three more alleged victims were added in subsequent indictments. Prosecutors say placing the seven men in restraint chairs was unnecessary, was improperly used as punishment, and caused pain and bodily injury. Jury selection was set to begin Wednesday, and the trial is expected to last at least two weeks. Hill calls himself \u8220 The Crime Fighter\u8221  and uses Batman imagery on social media and in campaign ads. He has been a divisive figure \u8211  attracting both fans and critics \u8211  since he first became sheriff in 2005. This will be his second trial on criminal charges. The voters of Clayton County returned him to office in 2012 while he was under indictment, accused of using his office for personal gain \u8211  charges he ultimately beat. Hill and his lawyers have said his prosecution is baseless and politically motivated.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Indianapolis: The state Supreme Court issued an order Wednesday that prevents the state from enforcing a Republican-backed abortion ban while it considers whether the ban violates the state constitution. The court said in the order that it was taking over appeals of a judge\u8217 s decision last month that blocked the law a week after it took effect. It denied a request from the state attorney general\u8217 s office to set aside the preliminary injunction and scheduled a hearing on the lawsuit filed by abortion clinic operators for Jan. 12. Owen County Judge Kelsey Hanlon blocked the law from being enforced, writing that \u8220 there is reasonable likelihood that this significant restriction of personal autonomy offends the liberty guarantees of the Indiana Constitution\u8221  and that the clinics will prevail in the lawsuit. The ban was approved by the Republican-dominated Legislature on Aug. 5 and signed by GOP Gov. Eric Holcomb. That made Indiana the first state to enact tighter abortion restrictions after the U.S. Supreme Court eliminated federal abortion protections by overturning Roe v. Wade in June. The five-member Indiana Supreme Court \u8211  all the justices were appointed by Republican governors \u8211  did not explain its decision.

Months after the Kansas State Board of Education helped organize a committee to address severe deficiencies in the education of and for Native American people, the group returned Tuesday with an initial proposal to have the state board formally recommend all Kansas high schools remove any Native American-themed mascot and imagery. The board had helped create the group after Education Commissioner Randy Watson made disparaging comments toward Native Americans in February.}

Last year, the company\u8217 s management group acquired an unused distilling facility, the governor\u8217 s office said in a news release. To bolster the nearly complete distillery, company leaders began an expansion that will involve purchasing additional land, constructing barrel storage and making upgrades throughout the facility. \u8220 Kentucky\u8217 s bourbon and spirits industry continues to see tremendous growth,\u8221  Beshear said. \u8220 This is not possible without the support of companies like Jackson Purchase Distillery, which is tripling its original investment in this project and creating nearly double the number of quality jobs.\u8221  The distillery will produce in excess of 60,000 barrels annually once fully operational.}

U.S. District Magistrate Judge Michael North held a status conference on efforts to bring the Orleans Justice Center into compliance with mandated reforms. Those measures are required under a 2013 court-backed agreement involving the U.S. Justice Department, inmate advocates and the Orleans Parish Sheriff\u8217 s Office. North applauded the improvements, The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports, but he warned Sheriff Susan Hutson that her administration still has a way to go in terms of transparency. North said the sheriff\u8217 s office has started sending the court weekly reports about jail incidents, including acts of violence, overdoses and suicide attempts. But he said more needs to be done. \u8220 We still have no information as to what\u8217 s being done to investigate these problems and why they continue to happen,\u8221  North said shortly before ordering the sheriff\u8217 s office to submit a proposal to the court for how it will share information about its investigations and prevention plans.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Baltimore: An appeals court refused Wednesday to intervene in a lower court\u8217 s decision to free a man who served more than 20 years in prison for the killing of a high school student, a case chronicled by the groundbreaking \u8220 Serial\u8221  podcast. The state Court of Special Appeals issued its order a day after prosecutors dropped charges against Adnan Syed in the 1999 killing of 18-year-old Hae Min Lee, saying DNA evidence excluded him as a suspect. Circuit Court Judge Melissa Phinn ruled last month that the state had violated its legal obligation to share evidence that could have bolstered Syed\u8217 s defense. Phinn ordered Syed\u8217 s release from prison and gave prosecutors 30 days to decide whether to retry him or drop the charges. Lee\u8217 s family asked the Court of Special Appeals \u8211  Maryland\u8217 s intermediate appellate court \u8211  to halt the case and suspend the deadline that Phinn set for prosecutors to decide whether to drop the charges. They argued they didn\u8217 t get adequate notice of the hearing at which Phinn ruled. A lawyer for Lee\u8217 s family said they wanted the judge to hold another hearing they could attend and address the court. But a three-judge panel from the appeals court rejected the family\u8217 s request in a two-page order. The panel gave Lee\u8217 s family 15 days to argue why their appeal isn\u8217 t moot given that the case against Syed has been dropped.}

It has been used as a place for public executions, as a pasture, and as a military training field, according to the nonprofit group Friends of the Public Garden, which helped develop the Boston Common Master Plan. More recently it has hosted civil rights marches, Vietnam War protests and a 1979 Catholic Mass celebrated by Pope John Paul II and attended by an estimated 400,000 people during a soaking rainstorm.

Molla also created and allowed others to start two GoFundMe accounts to benefit Molla and his family. In total, he submitted more than $300,000 in fraudulent insurance claims, of which he received approximately $61,000 from his insurance company.

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Jackson: Some legislators say they will renew efforts to clarify that people in Mississippi may possess chemical strips to detect traces of the deadly drug fentanyl. A bill to decriminalize the test strips died early this year. But the state House Drug Policy Committee chairman, Rep. Lee Yancy, R-Brandon, now supports the effort, the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reports. Rep. Sam Creekmore, R-New Albany, said he\u8217 ll introduce a bill during the legislative session that begins in January. Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid more lethal than heroin, has pushed drug overdoses to new highs across America. Delivering test strips to people is part of a strategy known as \u8220 harm reduction\u8221  that gives appropriate products to drug users to prevent accidental overdoses. If someone is about to take an illicit drug, they brush part of the substance against a test strip to see if it contains trace amounts of fentanyl. Opponents say the strategy encourages drug users to continue an addiction, but health professionals who testified at a legislative committee meeting Monday said it\u8217 s a useful mitigation strategy that can save lives. Dr. Daniel Edney, Mississippi\u8217 s state health officer, said he wants people who use drugs to seek professional help to end their addiction, but they need \u8220 harm reduction\u8221  tools in the short term. \u8220 The test strips are not going to encourage people to use drugs,\u8221  Edney said. \u8220 Those who are going to use drugs are going to continue to use drugs, anyway.\u8221 }

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Helena: The commission that oversees the Montana State Library voted Wednesday to accept a new logo with colors pulled from the state flag after one commissioner criticized an earlier color scheme as reminding her of a rainbow LGBTQ pride flag. Commissioners voted 4-2 to approve the new logo but also decided to pause spending any additional money on the rebranding rollout until December, when they can consider additional information about how that money would be spent. The commission had voted 4-3 in early July to reject the initial logo after the library paid a company $130,000 in donated library foundation funds to create it as part of a rebranding effort to educate residents about the services the state library provides. Commissioner Tammy Hall said in June that the original colors brought to mind a pride flag, something she argued could set up an unnecessary political battle as the library seeks funding from the likely Republican-controlled Legislature next year.

Democratic Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin and Senate President Nicholas Scutari, surrounded by other lawmakers and red T-shirt-clad Moms Demand Action supporters, said the new measure will bar permit holders from carrying in schools, polling places, bars, restaurants, theaters, sports arenas, airports, casinos and child care facilities. It also sets up a new requirement that permit holders carry insurance to protect against accidental discharge, coverage that Scutari said is already available in insurance marketplaces. The bill increases permitting, though the exact amount wasn\u8217 t immediately clear. The funds will be put toward compensation for crime victims under the legislation. The measure also calls for permit holders to undergo gun safety training and would set up a vetting process that requires non-family references to vouch for applicants. It would disqualify applicants with past violations of restraining orders and other \u8220 character of temperament\u8221  concerns, though just how those issues would be defined wasn\u8217 t immediately clear.}

The decision from the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals came six days after a federal district judge in Syracuse declared multiple portions of the law unconstitutional and placed a temporary hold on them. The state promptly appealed the order. The decision puts a hold on U.S. District Judge Glenn Suddaby\u8217 s order until a three-judge appeals panel can make a decision on the state\u8217 s motion.

She was also the state\u8217 s first Black representative since 1901. Former lawmaker Mickey Michaux of Durham served in the Legislature for more than 45 years, almost all of that time in the House, where he served as the chief budget writer in the late 2000s. He was appointed a U.S. attorney in 1977, becoming the first African American in such a role in the South since Reconstruction, according to the state Department of Natural and Cultural Resources. Other recipients are Dr. Priya S. Kishnani, a professor and researcher at the Duke University School of Medicine; Stanley Riggs, a longtime East Carolina University marine geologist and expert on the coast and climate change; and journalist David Zucchino, a graduate of UNC-Chapel Hill who received a Pulitzer Prize in 2021 for his book on the 1898 overthrow of Wilmington\u8217 s government by white supremacists.}

Attorneys for the Clark County woman argue the judge\u8217 s ruling, upheld by the 2nd Ohio District Court of Appeals, runs counter to a federal court decision, an Ohio Department of Health certificate change process, a Supreme Court probate form allowing for gender corrections, and procedures in more than a dozen other Ohio probate courts. The Clark County judge improperly ruled that nothing in state law gives probate judges authority to correct gender on a birth certificate unless it was originally made in error, according to an Aug. 1 court filing by the woman\u8217 s attorneys asking the high court to hear the case. The attorneys also noted that the state Health Department updated its process to allow for birth certificate corrections after a federal court in 2020 found unconstitutional Ohio\u8217 s rule prohibiting changes to gender on birth certificates. In addition, the state Supreme Court issued a form in August 2021 allowing probate courts to correct gender under state law, the attorneys said.

Darnell Weaver described the grant announcements as a culminating moment after months of coordination and planning work by police leaders and their agencies. \u8220 Cameras will add transparency, provide accountability and give a point of view, of perspective, to every police contact,\u8221  he said. The grant money was apportioned to finance the program for five years. The awarding of the money carries significance beyond finances. Police organizations that receive the money must comply with a detailed set of regulations on the use and operation of body cameras.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Columbia: A pregnant Black activist serving four years in prison over comments she made to police during racial justice protests in the summer of 2020 will not receive a lesser sentence, a judge has ruled. A jury this spring found Brittany Martin, 34, of Sumter, guilty of breaching the peace in a high and aggravated manner. Martin\u8217 s attorneys pushed for the sentence to be reconsidered and expressed concern about her pregnancy and health. Racial justice groups also got involved. In an Oct. 5 order, Judge R. Kirk Griffin pointed to Martin\u8217 s prior criminal convictions that he said contributed to her original sentence. In November 2020, an Iowa judge sentenced Martin to probation for leaving the scene of an injury and willfully causing bodily harm after her teenage son accused her of purposely hitting him with her SUV and driving away. Griffin also noted previous convictions across multiple states for shoplifting, public disorderly conduct and possession of a short-barreled shotgun. Sumter County Assistant Solicitor Bronwyn McElveen said in a September filing that Martin has been on probation at least six times. \u8220 Probation has not been a deterrent to further criminal activities for the Defendant,\u8221  Griffin wrote in his order. \u8220 An active prison sentence was appropriate in this instance.\u8221 }

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Sioux Falls: The state\u8217 s Public Utilities Commission on Tuesday authorized its staff to begin reviewing an application for a pipeline designed to transport carbon dioxide from ethanol refineries to an underground site in Illinois, assessing a filing fee of up to $400,000. The pipeline is the second proposed in the state. Both projects would pump carbon dioxide to sequestration sites where it would be buried thousands of feet underground. The one before the Public Utilities Commission \u8211  proposed by Navigator CO2 \u8211  would connect ethanol refineries across the Great Plains to a site in Illinois. The commission\u8217 s staff found that it could cost over $270,000 to review Navigator CO2\u8217 s application, which was submitted last month. Navigator CO2 agreed to covering a filing fee of up to $400,000. \u8220 It needs to be a quality evaluation and not have that cost fall back on the taxpayers,\u8221  said Kristen Edwards, a staff attorney for the commission. The pipeline projects, spurred by federal tax credits, promise to help in the fight against climate change by storing carbon dioxide rather than letting it be emitted into the atmosphere. But environmental activists have also pointed out the technology has struggled to get off the ground and allows emission-heavy industries to avoid taking drastic steps to cut greenhouse gases.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Nashville: Tennessee Secretary of State Tre Hargett has taken a plea deal after he was charged with driving under the influence after leaving a bar in June. In a statement, Hargett said he offered a best interest plea in the case Thursday, which amounts to pleading guilty while maintaining innocence. The Republican said his attorney believes he had a \u8220 strong case\u8221  to argue, but Hargett said he wanted to \u8220 accept responsibility for my actions and move forward and to focus on how God can use me to make something positive from this difficult time.\u8221  \u8220 It is wrong to drive any vehicle under the influence of alcohol, and rest assured this is a mistake I will never make again,\u8221  he said. The plea deal includes a $350 fine, a DUI school requirement, and having his driver\u8217 s license restricted for a year, news outlets reports. According to a report by a Tullahoma Police Department officer, an officer on June 18 pulled over the car Hargett was driving after watching it leave a bar and swerve over lane markings several times. The officer wrote that Hargett smelled like an \u8220 intoxicant,\u8221  had glassy eyes and kept saying, \u8220 Yes, sir,\u8221  at inappropriate times when he had not been asked a question. Hargett performed poorly on a field sobriety test, and a passenger in the car \u8211  who was not named \u8211  said the two had been drinking four hours earlier, the report said. Hargett agreed to a blood sample. Hargett has said he had been at the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival in Manchester.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 New Boston: Prosecutors asked a jury Wednesday to sentence a woman to death for killing a pregnant woman and stealing her unborn daughter from her womb. The appeal came as the penalty phase of Taylor Parker\u8217 s capital murder trial began for the October 2020 murder of Reagan Simmons-Hancock and theft of her unborn baby. The Bowie County jury previously found Parker guilty of capital murder. Prosecutor Kelley Crisp told jurors that the evidence would show Parker, 29, faked a pregnancy and repeatedly lied before killing Simmons-Hancock, 21, at the woman\u8217 s New Boston home Oct. 9, 2020, to get the infant she claimed to have been carrying. The baby also died. Parker\u8217 s attorneys hope to persuade the jury to spare Parker\u8217 s life and let her serve life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Defense attorney Jeff Harrelson said they would show that Parker was mentally ill.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Salt Lake City: The two candidates challenging U.S. Rep. Burgess Owens in a suburban congressional race laid into the first-term Republican on Wednesday evening for announcing at the eleventh hour that he wouldn\u8217 t participate in the sole general election debate. Democrat Darlene McDonald and United Utah Party\u8217 s January Walker both accused Owens of being a coward for skipping it and cast doubt on his reasoning \u8211  that he took issue with the moderator. Owens\u8217  absence reflects a trend emerging in politics nationwide: While running attack ads and speaking to friendly media outlets, candidates and their consultants are deciding to minimize debate appearances or shirk them altogether. Owens said Wednesday afternoon that he wouldn\u8217 t participate because the commission had chosen Salt Lake Tribune editor Lauren Gustus as moderator. He was outraged in April 2021 when the newspaper published an editorial cartoon satirizing remarks he made about immigration and people crossing the border illegally. The sketch likened his remarks about immigrants entering people\u8217 s neighborhoods after crossing the border to Ku Klux Klan rhetoric. The cartoon garnered pushback from Utah\u8217 s entire congressional delegation. \u8220 I will not, in good conscience, have anything to do with the racist Salt Lake Tribune,\u8221  he said in a statement published on Facebook and YouTube.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Waterbury: A drop of blood that was subjected to modern DNA testing enabled Vermont State Police detectives to make an arrest in the 1989 murder of a Danby couple found stabbed to death in their home, police said. Michael Anthony Louise, 79, was arrested Thursday in Syracuse, New York, on two counts of second-degree murder in the deaths of George Peacock, 76, and Catherine Peacock, 73, police said. The Peacocks were found dead Sept. 17, 1989. There were no signs of forced entry or items of significance having been removed from the house. Louise, who was married to one of the Peacocks\u8217  daughters, was identified as a suspect about two weeks later. Investigators at the time developed circumstantial evidence tying Louise to the killings, police said. Detectives were unable to establish a conclusive link until forensic testing in May 2020 confirmed a DNA match to George Peacock in a spot of blood found inside Louise\u8217 s car in October 1989. The blood sample had been tested previously, but earlier tests were inconclusive. Authorities did not say why it took two years to make the arrest following the DNA match but said more information would be released when Louise is arraigned.}
