2024 JUN 19 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at NewsRx Medical Devices Daily -- Investigators publish new report on Surgery - Vasectomy. According to news reporting out of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, by NewsRx editors, research stated, "Vasectomy is the most commonly performed urologic procedure in the United States and is a highly effective form of male contraception. The introduction of guidelines by urological societies has standardized vasectomy care." 
 Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the Medical College of Wisconsin, "Providers should be awadre of the rationale behind these guidelines, as well as key differences among them. While few major changes to vasectomy technique have been adopted over the past 40 years, new, reversible vasal occlusive technologies may affect delivery of male contraceptive care in the future. Here, we perform a comparative review of vasectomy guidelines from six urological societies worldwide." 
 According to the news editors, the research concluded: "In addition, we report on the status of several experimental vasal occlusion methods that may be available in the next decade." 
 This research has been peer-reviewed.
