Vasectomies at clinics, hospitals and medical centers in Oregon and southwest Washington have increased since   last year, local health officials tell Axios.
Why it matters: The  , which isn't   to the Pacific Northwest, could mark a shift in attitudes about a man's role in family planning.
Driving the news: Doctors across the country have reported surges in the procedure's popularity since the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court in June 2022 ended the federal constitutional right to abortion.
  published earlier this year, researchers found a 35% increase in new vasectomy consultation requests since the   ruling.
What they're saying: Jason Hedges, an associate professor of urology in the Oregon Health & Science University's School of Medicine, performs 300 to 500 vasectomies per year but his practice is "booking out further than we used to," he tells Axios.
"It's always been one of the easiest and most successful forms of birth control. And we typically know from the past, when there are big social, political or economic events that can impact the frequency of vasectomies."
In  , Hedges and other researchers found vasectomies to be more common in times of economic recession, whereas vasectomy reversals rose during periods of less financial pressure.
Meanwhile, Planned Parenthood's East Portland, Milwaukie, Salem, Eugene, Bend, and Vancouver, Washington clinics have also seen more interest in the procedure, according to Jessica Keersemaker, vice president for patient services.
Right now, each location performs 20 to 40 vasectomies per month and has a waitlist of about 25 patients waiting to be scheduled.
Keersemaker said via email that this "is a long-term trend" and that to accommodate demand Planned Parenthood has quickly added additional capacity at its health centers.
Of note: Vasectomies can cost upwards of $1,000 for those without insurance, but are typically no cost for those with coverage, according to Hedges.
The procedure can be   in most cases, but that  .
The intrigue: Abortion remains legal in   and  , yet Hedges said many of the young men who have sought the vasectomy procedure from him in the last year — whether they are single or in a relationship — cite the fall of Roe for their decision.
