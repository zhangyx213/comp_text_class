2024 NOV 13 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Pediatrics Daily News -- Fresh data on Technology - Assisted Reproductive Technology are presented in a new report. According to news originating from Hamburg, Germany, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, "The vasectomy is a safe and effective method of contraception for men. Up to 6% of men who underwent vasectomy have a renewed child wish." 
 Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the University of Hamburg-Eppendorf, "Microsurgical vasectomy reversal (VR) in men, microsurgical epididymal sperm aspiration (MESA), or testicular sperm extraction (TESE) in men plus assisted reproductive technology (ART) in the female partner as well as the combination of VR and MESA/TESE plus ART represent established therapeutic strategies. Various factors may impact the success of VR, as defined by patency and pregnancy rate following VR, including the female partner's age, the obstructive interval, and the surgical VR technique. There is no difference in the pregnancy and live birth rate following VR or MESA/TESE plus ART. However, following MESA/TESE plus ART, time to pregnancy is shorter compared with VR. Overall, VR is more cost-effective than MESA/TESE plus ART and allows for a lower therapeutic burden, especially in the female partner. In addition, VR combined with TESE plus-if necessary-ART is more cost-effective than MESA/TESE plus ART alone, even in female partners with advanced age." 
 According to the news editors, the research concluded: "For successful counseling regarding the different therapy options for a renewed child wish after vasectomy, it is important to evaluate the underlying individual situation of the couple." 
 This research has been peer-reviewed.
