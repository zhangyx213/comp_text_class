2024 DEC 03 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at NewsRx Medical Devices Daily -- Investigators discuss new findings in azoospermia. According to news originating from Aurora, Colorado, by NewsRx editors, the research stated, "Background/Objectives: The American Urological Association (AUA) vasectomy guidelines' current recommendation to obtain the first post-vasectomy semen analysis (PVSA) from 8 weeks to 16 weeks post-vasectomy is based predominantly on azoospermia rates. However, non-compliance with semen analysis after vasectomy is a known problem in this patient population." 
 The news journalists obtained a quote from the research from University of Colorado School of Medicine: "An approach that optimizes clearance and compliance is essential when adopting appropriate post-vasectomy care guidelines, specifically the scheduling of the first PVSA. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies assessing compliance and clearance to determine the optimal time of first PVSA. Databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, POPLINE) were searched for studies that contained the following: rate of azoospermia and rare nonmotile sperm (RNMS), compliance, recanalization, persistent RNMS, pregnancies, and incidence of repeat vasectomy. A total of 28 studies were included in this review. The patient compliance was 47-100% and trended downward with increasing time to first PVSA. There was a positive trend in azoospermia rate as post-vasectomy time increased, but this plateaued at 8 weeks. Compliance and post-vasectomy semen analysis clearance (PVSAC) converged at 5.7 weeks, with rates of 74.5% and 74.6%, respectively. A proportion of 1.5% of patients exhibited persistent RNMS. Recanalization events had an incidence rate of 1.5%. Repeat vasectomies were performed in 1.6% of patients." 
 According to the news reporters, the research concluded: "Based on our study optimizing post-vasectomy semen clearance with follow-up compliance, we recommend initial PVSA between 6 to 18 weeks post-vasectomy, as this offers improved compliance over current AUA guidelines which recommend PVSA at 8 to 16 weeks and allows for the identification of instances of “subclinical recanalization” that may be missed at later time points."
