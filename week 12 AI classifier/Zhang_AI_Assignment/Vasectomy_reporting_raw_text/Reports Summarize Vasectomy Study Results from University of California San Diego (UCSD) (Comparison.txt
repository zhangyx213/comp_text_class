2024 JUL 15 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Health Policy and Law Daily -- New research on Surgery - Vasectomy is the subject of a report. According to news originating from La Jolla, California, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, "The Supreme Court ruling Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization (June 2022) overturned federal protection of abortion rights, resulting in significant impact on both male and female reproductive rights and health care delivery. We conducted a retrospective review of all patients who underwent vasectomy at a single academic institution between June 2021 and June 2023." 
 Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the University of California San Diego (UCSD), "Our objective was to compare the rates of childless and partnerless vasectomies 1 year before and after this ruling, as these men may be more susceptible to postprocedural regret. Of total, 631 men (median age = 39 years, range = 20-70) underwent vasectomy consultation. Total vasectomies pre- and post-Dobbs were 304 (48%) versus 327 (52%). Total childless and partnerless vasectomies pre- and post-Dobbs were 44 (42%) versus 61 (58%) and 43 (46%) versus 50 (54%). Vasectomy completion rate was slightly increased post-Dobbs (90% vs. 88%; p = .240). The post-Dobbs cohort had significantly less children (1.8 vs. 2.0; p = .031). Men in the post-Dobbs era were significantly more likely to be commercially insured (72% vs. 64%) and less likely to be uninsured (1% vs. 6%; p = .002). Men who underwent childless vasectomy were significantly more likely to be younger (36.4 vs. 39.8 years; p< .001). There was a significantly greater proportion of Hispanic and Black men in the partnerless cohort compared to the cohort with partners (24% vs. 19% and 9% vs. 2%; p = .002)." 
 According to the news editors, the research concluded: "Patients should be counseled on the permanent nature of this procedure, underscoring need for effective and reversible male contraception."
