2024 JUN 14 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at NewsRx Policy and Law Daily -- Current study results on Surgery - Vasectomy have been published. According to news reporting out of New York City, New York, by NewsRx editors, research stated, "In the United States (US) men who undergo vasectomy and/or vasectomy reversal (vasovasotomy) are likely to pay out-of-pocket for these procedures. We characterized the publicly disclosed pricing of both procedures with a focus on variability in self-pay prices." 
 Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Weill Cornell Medical College, "We queried all US hospitals for publicly disclosed prices of vasectomy and vasovasotomy. We assessed interhospital variability in self-pay pricing and compared hospitals charging high (>= 75th percentile) and low (<= 25th percentile) self-pay prices for either procedure. We also examined trends in pricing after the 2022 US Supreme Court decision that allowed individual states to ban abortion. Of 6692 hospitals, 1375 (20.5%) and 281 (4.2%) disclosed self-pay prices for vasectomy and vasovasotomy, respectively. There was a 17-fold difference between the 10th and 90th percentile self-pay prices for vasectomy ($421-$7147) and a 39-fold difference for vasovasotomy ($446-$17,249). Compared with hospitals charging low (<= 25th percentile) self-pay prices for vasectomy or vasovasotomy, hospitals charging high (>= 75th percentile) prices were larger (median 150 vs. 59 beds, p< 0.001) and more likely to be for-profit (31.2% vs. 7.8%, p< 0.001), academic-affiliated (52.7% vs. 23.1%, p< 0.001), and located in an urban zip code (70.1% vs. 41.3%, p< 0.001). From October 2022 to April 2023, the median self-pay price of vasectomy increased by 10% (from $1667 to $1832) while the median self-pay price of vasovasotomy decreased by 16% (from $3309 to $2786)." 
 According to the news editors, the research concluded: "We found large variability in self-pay pricing for vasectomy and vasectomy reversal, which may serve as a barrier to the accessibility of male reproductive care."
