2024 APR 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Insurance Daily News -- Current study results on Surgery - Vasectomy have been published. According to news reporting from Cleveland, Ohio, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, "Due to the historic lack of transparency in healthcare pricing in the United States, the degree of price variation for vasectomy is largely unknown. Our study aims to assess characteristics of hospitals reporting prices for vasectomy as well as price variation associated with hospital factors and insurance status." 
 The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Case Western Reserve University, "A cross-sectional analysis was performed in October, 2022 using the Turquoise Database which compiles publicly available hospital pricing data. The database was queried for vasectomy prices to identify the cash (paid by patients not using insurance), commercial (negotiated by private insurers) and Medicare and Medicaid prices for vasectomies. Hospital characteristics of those that reported a price for vasectomy and those that did not were compared and pricing differences based on hospital ownership and reimbursement source were determined using multivariable linear regression analysis. Overall, only 24.7% (1657/6700) of hospitals reported a price for vasectomy. Those that reported a price had more beds (median 117 vs 80, p< 0.001), more physicians (median 1745 vs 1275, p< 0.001). They were also more likely to be nonprofit hospitals (77% vs 14%, p< 0.001) and to be in well-resourced areas (ADI 91.7 vs 94.4, p< 0.001). Both commercial prices and cash prices for vasectomy were lower at nonprofit hospitals than at for-profit hospitals (commercial: $1959.47 vs $2861.56, p< 0.001; cash: $1429.74 vs $3185.37, p< 0.001). Our study highlights the current state of pricing transparency for vasectomy in the United States. Patients may be counseled to consider seeking vasectomy at a nonprofit hospital to reduce their costs, especially when paying with cash." 
 According to the news reporters, the research concluded: "These findings also suggest a need for new policies to target areas with decreased price transparency to reduce price disparities."
