When discussing reproductive health choices, one procedure has been gaining attentionespecially since the fall of Roe v. Wadefor its effectiveness: the vasectomy. As individuals and couples explore long-term contraception options, vasectomies have emerged as a popular choice for those seeking a permanent solutionrates have increased by 26% in the past decade. With its relatively low risks and high success rates, this procedure is reshaping conversations about family planning.
The AMA's What Doctors Wish Patients Knewa„cents series provides physicians with a platform to share what they want patients to understand about today's health care headlines.
In this installment, three physicians took time to discuss what patients need to know about getting a vasectomy. These AMA members are:
Jason Jameson, MD, a urologist and chief of urology at the Phoenix Veterans Affairs Medical Center, who serves as a delegate for the American Urological Association in the AMA House of Delegates.
Amarnath Rambhatla, MD, a urologist at Henry Ford Health and director of men's health at the Vattikuti Urology Institute in Detroit.
Moshe Wald, MD, a urologist at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics and an associate professor in the department of urology at Carver College of Medicine in Iowa City.
Henry Ford Health and University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics are members of the AMA Health System Program, which provides enterprise solutions to equip leadership, physicians and care teams with resources to help drive the future of medicine.
There are seasonal spikes in vasectomies
"We sometimes see seasonal spikes in vasectomies. We see it in March and then also in November and December before the end of the year," Dr. Rambhatla said. "We think it spikes at the end of the year because everyone has met their deductible for the year.
"In March, it's been loosely associated with March Madness, he added, noting "the running joke is that men get their vasectomy around the NCAA basketball tournament and ask their wives for permission to lay on the couch for four straight days so they can watch the basketball tournament."
"The other interesting thing we've seen is with the Roe v. Wade reversal. There are studies showing an increase in Google trends, searches and consultations for vasectomies after that," Dr. Rambhatla said. "So, it seems like some men are more inclined to be in control of their fertility status after that ruling."
It's a minor surgical procedure
"A vasectomy is a minor surgical procedure, which is aimed at eventually achieving permanent birth control," said Dr. Wald, noting "the procedure is typically performed in a clinic setting under local anesthesia, which means injection of numbing medication into the area.
"However, in some cases, based on anatomy and on the patient's preference it could also potentially be done in the operating room under sedation or general anesthesia," he added. "But the vast majority are being performed in the clinic under local anesthesia."
"The procedure involves the surgical interruption of a tube called the vas deferens. The vas deferens is the tube that drains sperm from the testicle outwards and a man typically has two of them, one on each side," Dr. Wald said. "So, the idea is to interrupt these tubes, and then allow enough time for the sperm that at the time of the vasectomy was already beyond the vasectomy site to wash out."
The procedure "usually takes about 2030 minutes. One or two small cuts are made in the scrotum with a scalpel or no-scalpel instrument," Dr. Jameson said, noting "the vas deferens are cut and tied or sealed with heat. The skin may or may not be closed with sutures."
But "if the vas deferens are not easy to feel due to body characteristicsobesity, previous scarringthe procedure may be more challenging to perform," Dr. Jameson noted.
It's OK to drive yourself home
"Most of the time patients are OK to drive themselves home after the procedure. Occasionally I'll have some patients who are a little nervous or anxious about getting a vasectomy," said Dr. Rambhatla. "So, we can prescribe them medication to help calm down their anxiety for the procedure.
"In those situations, they need to have a driver with them because that medicine can alter their ability to drive," he added. "Otherwise yes, you could drive yourself home."
Don't be nervous, it's straightforward
Patients "should definitely relax. It's a straightforward, easy procedure," said Dr. Rambhatla. "The most common feedback I get from men after the procedure is: Oh, I thought it was going to be a lot worse than that."
"Sometimes their friends will mess with them before the procedure and say it's going to be a terrible experience and it is just good old fun," he said. "But most of the time, people say it wasn't so bad and they had nothing to worry about."
Follow up requires a semen test
A vasectomy is "not immediately effective. If you can imagine a tube through which sperm is passing, the vasectomy is basically occluding that tube so sperm isn't passing through anymore, but there's still sperm on the other side of that tube we've occluded," said Dr. Rambhatla. "And so, all that old sperm needs to be cleared out for men to become sterile."
"We check a post-vasectomy semen analysis about three months after the procedure to make sure all that old sperm has been cleared out," he said. "And sometimes some men may take longer, so it can take up to six months or so to clear out all the old sperm."
