2023 MAR 24 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Health Policy and Law Daily -- New research on Surgery - Vasectomy is the subject of a report. According to news originating from Cleveland, Ohio, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, "In June 2022 the United States Supreme Court issued a ruling in the case Dobbs v. Jackson that overturned Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling establishing a federally protected right to abortion in the United States. Anecdotal reports suggested increased vasectomy volume following this event; however, no published data exist." 
 Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Cleveland Clinic Foundation, "We sought to describe trends in vasectomy consultation before and after the Dobbs v. Jackson ruling (referred to as pre- and post-Dobbs herein). Following IRB approval, we reviewed charts of all adults seeking vasectomy consultation in July-August 2021 and July-August 2022 at a large healthcare organization. We then aggregated vasectomy procedural billing data from 2018 to present. The primary outcome was volume of vasectomy consultation appointments and the secondary outcome was number of vasectomies performed. In July-August 2021 (Pre-Dobbs), 116 men attended vasectomy consultation versus 142 men in July-August 2022 (Post-Dobbs). Median age Post-Dobbs was significantly younger than Pre-Dobbs (35 vs 38 years, respectively, p = 0.01) with a significant increase in Post-Dobbs men under 30 seeking vasectomy (p = 0.005). A total of 16.9% (24/142) of Post-Dobbs men were childless, compared to 8.6% (10/116) of Pre-Dobbs men (p = 0.05). Of those with children, median number of offspring was unchanged at 2. Billing data showed a significant increase in vasectomy procedural volumes Post-Dobbs. While overturning Roe v Wade directly impacted female reproductive rights, number of vasectomy consultations and procedures increased significantly following this decision. Younger men, especially those under 30, as well as childless men were significantly more likely to seek consultation Post-Dobbs compared to the prior reproductive legal climate." 
 According to the news editors, the research concluded: "While longer-term data are needed, findings indicate that men are invested in maintaining reproductive autonomy for themselves and their partners."
