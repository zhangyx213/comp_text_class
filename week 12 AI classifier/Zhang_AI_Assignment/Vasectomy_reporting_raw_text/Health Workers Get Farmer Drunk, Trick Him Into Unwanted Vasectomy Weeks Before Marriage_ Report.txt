The Indian government has an incentive program for sterilization in which it pays men to get vasectomies.Shutterstock
A 35-year-old   
The victim, who is from the Navi Sedhavi village in Mehsana district in  
The victim stated that he was taken to a medical center by healthcare workers who were looking to make a commission off of sterilizing him,  
A false consent form was also forged on the victim's behalf, bearing his fingerprint. It states that he has three children.
"Vasectomy is not a scam as being projected because health workers don't have a target to achieve. It is voluntary for which a health worker gets Rs 200 to Rs 500. The incident is being investigated," state health minister and government spokesperson Rushikesh Patel said.
The Indian government has long offered sterilization rewards in order to assist with the nation's growing problem of overpopulation. They have incentivized citizens to do so by offering compensation of 2,000 rupees to anyone who undergoes the procedure and 200 to 500 rupees to medical workers every time they successfully conduct a procedure.
The worker involved in the scheme has been suspended as investigation into the incident continues.
