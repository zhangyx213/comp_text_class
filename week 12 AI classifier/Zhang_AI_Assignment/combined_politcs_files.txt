Vasectomies at clinics, hospitals and medical centers in Oregon and southwest Washington have increased since   last year, local health officials tell Axios.
Why it matters: The  , which isn't   to the Pacific Northwest, could mark a shift in attitudes about a man's role in family planning.
Driving the news: Doctors across the country have reported surges in the procedure's popularity since the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court in June 2022 ended the federal constitutional right to abortion.
  published earlier this year, researchers found a 35% increase in new vasectomy consultation requests since the   ruling.
What they're saying: Jason Hedges, an associate professor of urology in the Oregon Health & Science University's School of Medicine, performs 300 to 500 vasectomies per year but his practice is "booking out further than we used to," he tells Axios.
"It's always been one of the easiest and most successful forms of birth control. And we typically know from the past, when there are big social, political or economic events that can impact the frequency of vasectomies."
In  , Hedges and other researchers found vasectomies to be more common in times of economic recession, whereas vasectomy reversals rose during periods of less financial pressure.
Meanwhile, Planned Parenthood's East Portland, Milwaukie, Salem, Eugene, Bend, and Vancouver, Washington clinics have also seen more interest in the procedure, according to Jessica Keersemaker, vice president for patient services.
Right now, each location performs 20 to 40 vasectomies per month and has a waitlist of about 25 patients waiting to be scheduled.
Keersemaker said via email that this "is a long-term trend" and that to accommodate demand Planned Parenthood has quickly added additional capacity at its health centers.
Of note: Vasectomies can cost upwards of $1,000 for those without insurance, but are typically no cost for those with coverage, according to Hedges.
The procedure can be   in most cases, but that  .
The intrigue: Abortion remains legal in   and  , yet Hedges said many of the young men who have sought the vasectomy procedure from him in the last year — whether they are single or in a relationship — cite the fall of Roe for their decision.

2024 OCT 01 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Health Policy and Law Daily -- Fresh data on Surgery - Vasectomy are presented in a new report. According to news originating from Cleveland, Ohio, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, "In June 2022 the United States Supreme Court issued a ruling in the case Dobbs v. Jackson that overturned Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling establishing a federally protected right to abortion in the United States. Anecdotal reports suggested increased vasectomy volume following this event; however, no published data exist." 
 Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Cleveland Clinic Foundation, "We sought to describe trends in vasectomy consultation before and after the Dobbs v. Jackson ruling (referred to as pre- and post-Dobbs herein). Following IRB approval, we reviewed charts of all adults seeking vasectomy consultation in July-August 2021 and July-August 2022 at a large healthcare organization. We then aggregated vasectomy procedural billing data from 2018 to present. The primary outcome was volume of vasectomy consultation appointments and the secondary outcome was number of vasectomies performed. In July-August 2021 (Pre-Dobbs), 116 men attended vasectomy consultation versus 142 men in July-August 2022 (Post-Dobbs). Median age Post-Dobbs was significantly younger than Pre-Dobbs (35 vs 38 years, respectively, p = 0.01) with a significant increase in Post-Dobbs men under 30 seeking vasectomy (p = 0.005). A total of 16.9% (24/142) of Post-Dobbs men were childless, compared to 8.6% (10/116) of Pre-Dobbs men (p = 0.05). Of those with children, median number of offspring was unchanged at 2. Billing data showed a significant increase in vasectomy procedural volumes Post-Dobbs. While overturning Roe v Wade directly impacted female reproductive rights, number of vasectomy consultations and procedures increased significantly following this decision. Younger men, especially those under 30, as well as childless men were significantly more likely to seek consultation Post-Dobbs compared to the prior reproductive legal climate." 
 According to the news editors, the research concluded: "While longer-term data are needed, findings indicate that men are invested in maintaining reproductive autonomy for themselves and their partners." 
 This research has been peer-reviewed.

Highlight: The MAGA Republican and Trump ally described an initiative to offer free vasectomies and medication abortion in Chicago as "truly heartbreaking."
Body


Representative  of Georgia, a MAGA  and one of 's closest allies, has  to offer free vasectomies and medication abortion near next week's Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Illinois, as "heartbreaking."
"I thought this was fake but it's not," she wrote on X on Saturday. "Planned Parenthood is going to provide free vasectomies and abortions at the Democratic National Convention this upcoming week," she added. "It's hard to even comprehend and it's truly heartbreaking. Being a mother is the most precious gift, choose life."
Planned Parenthood Great Rivers, which describes itself as "the leading provider, educator and protector of sexual and reproductive healthcare" in the St. Louis region, plans to run a mobile health center near the Democratic National Convention on August 19 and 20. Those who have scheduled an appointment, according to reports, will be able to get a vasectomy or medication abortion for free, while emergency contraception will be provided without appointment.
Newsweek contacted Greene's spokesperson and Planned Parenthood Great Rivers for comment by email on Sunday morning, outside of standard working hours.
According to Planned Parenthood, the average price of a vasectomy in the U.S. can go from zero to $1,000, including follow-up visits, depending on where people get it, what kind, and whether it is covered by health insurance. On the higher range, the procedure might cost more than some can afford.
The center already has a waiting list for vasectomy appointments due to high demand. "All free vasectomy and medication abortions are filled for our mobile health clinic in Chicago," Planned Parenthood Great Rivers wrote on X on Saturday.
"Check back soon—we will share the interest form link again if we have cancellations," it said, before adding that patients will still have access to the 11 Planned Parenthood's health centers in Chicago and its suburbs.
As of Saturday, the center still had availability for medication abortion appointments at its mobile health clinic in Chicago.
The offer of a free vasectomy or medication abortion is of enormous significance in southern Illinois, where Planned Parenthood Great Rivers operates, because of its proximity to Missouri, where abortion is now banned except in cases of medical emergencies. The Guttmacher Institute reported that roughly 2,860 Missourians traveled to Kansas in 2023 to have an abortion, while 8,710 went to Illinois.
Conservatives have responded to the initiative with anger and disbelief similar to that expressed by Greene. Sarah Fields, president of the conservative organization Texas Freedom Coalition, commented on it on X, writing: "The depravity of humankind has reached a point that breaks my heart and troubles my soul on a daily basis. I sincerely hope God returns soon. This cannot continue."
Disapproval has also come from  for Life, an anti-abortion rights national organization who openly criticizes the 's approach to the issue. The group wrote on X calling for the Democratic National Convention to "stop funding abortions and make birth free."
But protecting access to abortion is likely to be a central message during the convention next week, as Democratic nominee Vice President  is expected to take a more aggressive stance on the topic than President  had.
The vice president has consistently defended access to abortion during her career and her years in President Joe Biden's administration, condemning the 's decision to overturn Roe vs. Wade in summer 2022.
Abortion is also one that is a weak point for conservative  and one that could damage Trump's chances of victory in November. Two-thirds of American voters (66 percent) think abortion should be legal in either all cases (34 percent) or most cases (32 percent), according to a Quinnipiac University poll released in April—the highest level in two decades since the institute started measuring support for the practice.

2024 JUL 15 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Health Policy and Law Daily -- New research on Surgery - Vasectomy is the subject of a report. According to news originating from La Jolla, California, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, "The Supreme Court ruling Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization (June 2022) overturned federal protection of abortion rights, resulting in significant impact on both male and female reproductive rights and health care delivery. We conducted a retrospective review of all patients who underwent vasectomy at a single academic institution between June 2021 and June 2023." 
 Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the University of California San Diego (UCSD), "Our objective was to compare the rates of childless and partnerless vasectomies 1 year before and after this ruling, as these men may be more susceptible to postprocedural regret. Of total, 631 men (median age = 39 years, range = 20-70) underwent vasectomy consultation. Total vasectomies pre- and post-Dobbs were 304 (48%) versus 327 (52%). Total childless and partnerless vasectomies pre- and post-Dobbs were 44 (42%) versus 61 (58%) and 43 (46%) versus 50 (54%). Vasectomy completion rate was slightly increased post-Dobbs (90% vs. 88%; p = .240). The post-Dobbs cohort had significantly less children (1.8 vs. 2.0; p = .031). Men in the post-Dobbs era were significantly more likely to be commercially insured (72% vs. 64%) and less likely to be uninsured (1% vs. 6%; p = .002). Men who underwent childless vasectomy were significantly more likely to be younger (36.4 vs. 39.8 years; p< .001). There was a significantly greater proportion of Hispanic and Black men in the partnerless cohort compared to the cohort with partners (24% vs. 19% and 9% vs. 2%; p = .002)." 
 According to the news editors, the research concluded: "Patients should be counseled on the permanent nature of this procedure, underscoring need for effective and reversible male contraception."

The following information was released by the American Medical Association (AMA):
By
Sara Berg, MS , News Editor
When discussing reproductive health choices, one procedure has been gaining attentionespecially since the fall of Roe v. Wadefor its effectiveness: the vasectomy. As individuals and couples explore long-term contraception options, vasectomies have emerged as a popular choice for those seeking a permanent solutionrates have increased by 26% in the past decade. With its relatively low risks and high success rates, this procedure is reshaping conversations about family planning.
The AMA's What Doctors Wish Patients Knewa„cents series provides physicians with a platform to share what they want patients to understand about today's health care headlines.
In this installment, three physicians took time to discuss what patients need to know about getting a vasectomy. These AMA members are:
Jason Jameson, MD, a urologist and chief of urology at the Phoenix Veterans Affairs Medical Center, who serves as a delegate for the American Urological Association in the AMA House of Delegates.
Amarnath Rambhatla, MD, a urologist at Henry Ford Health and director of men's health at the Vattikuti Urology Institute in Detroit.
Moshe Wald, MD, a urologist at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics and an associate professor in the department of urology at Carver College of Medicine in Iowa City.
Henry Ford Health and University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics are members of the AMA Health System Program, which provides enterprise solutions to equip leadership, physicians and care teams with resources to help drive the future of medicine.
There are seasonal spikes in vasectomies
"We sometimes see seasonal spikes in vasectomies. We see it in March and then also in November and December before the end of the year," Dr. Rambhatla said. "We think it spikes at the end of the year because everyone has met their deductible for the year.
"In March, it's been loosely associated with March Madness, he added, noting "the running joke is that men get their vasectomy around the NCAA basketball tournament and ask their wives for permission to lay on the couch for four straight days so they can watch the basketball tournament."
"The other interesting thing we've seen is with the Roe v. Wade reversal. There are studies showing an increase in Google trends, searches and consultations for vasectomies after that," Dr. Rambhatla said. "So, it seems like some men are more inclined to be in control of their fertility status after that ruling."
It's a minor surgical procedure
"A vasectomy is a minor surgical procedure, which is aimed at eventually achieving permanent birth control," said Dr. Wald, noting "the procedure is typically performed in a clinic setting under local anesthesia, which means injection of numbing medication into the area.
"However, in some cases, based on anatomy and on the patient's preference it could also potentially be done in the operating room under sedation or general anesthesia," he added. "But the vast majority are being performed in the clinic under local anesthesia."
"The procedure involves the surgical interruption of a tube called the vas deferens. The vas deferens is the tube that drains sperm from the testicle outwards and a man typically has two of them, one on each side," Dr. Wald said. "So, the idea is to interrupt these tubes, and then allow enough time for the sperm that at the time of the vasectomy was already beyond the vasectomy site to wash out."
The procedure "usually takes about 2030 minutes. One or two small cuts are made in the scrotum with a scalpel or no-scalpel instrument," Dr. Jameson said, noting "the vas deferens are cut and tied or sealed with heat. The skin may or may not be closed with sutures."
But "if the vas deferens are not easy to feel due to body characteristicsobesity, previous scarringthe procedure may be more challenging to perform," Dr. Jameson noted.
It's OK to drive yourself home
"Most of the time patients are OK to drive themselves home after the procedure. Occasionally I'll have some patients who are a little nervous or anxious about getting a vasectomy," said Dr. Rambhatla. "So, we can prescribe them medication to help calm down their anxiety for the procedure.
"In those situations, they need to have a driver with them because that medicine can alter their ability to drive," he added. "Otherwise yes, you could drive yourself home."
Don't be nervous, it's straightforward
Patients "should definitely relax. It's a straightforward, easy procedure," said Dr. Rambhatla. "The most common feedback I get from men after the procedure is: Oh, I thought it was going to be a lot worse than that."
"Sometimes their friends will mess with them before the procedure and say it's going to be a terrible experience and it is just good old fun," he said. "But most of the time, people say it wasn't so bad and they had nothing to worry about."
Follow up requires a semen test
A vasectomy is "not immediately effective. If you can imagine a tube through which sperm is passing, the vasectomy is basically occluding that tube so sperm isn't passing through anymore, but there's still sperm on the other side of that tube we've occluded," said Dr. Rambhatla. "And so, all that old sperm needs to be cleared out for men to become sterile."
"We check a post-vasectomy semen analysis about three months after the procedure to make sure all that old sperm has been cleared out," he said. "And sometimes some men may take longer, so it can take up to six months or so to clear out all the old sperm."
