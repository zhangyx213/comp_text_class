PERSPECTIVE

ROMNEY THE INCREDIBLE

BY RAYMOND MOLEY

If there were not a George Romney,
invent one. I am still willing to be
convinced that the New York gover-
nor would reject a nomination if it
sought him after the bloody field was
strewn with the remains of the pres-
ent aspirants. But even if Rockefeller
does not want to be nominated, he is
the authentic champion of the Eastern
Establishment which cannot endure
the prospect of a Republican conven-
tion without a candidate for the nomi-
nation who reflects the interests and
views of that corner of the nation. It
has had such a candidate ever since
the days of Roscoe Conkling and the
time when Thomas B. Reed unsuc-
cessfully challenged McKinley and
Hanna in 1896.

In 1964, after the California pri-
mary virtually eliminated Rockefeller,
the E.E. projected Governor Scranton
as a somewhat singed and reluctant
offering. And now, with somewhat
similar blindness to the dominance in
the GOP of the West, the Midwest
and the South, the Michigan governor
has been built up as a contender.

But now, as Romney stands naked
in his inadequacy, there are voices
not far from New York City and Al-
bany supporting Governor Reagan.
Not because they admire him and his
views, but because he might be used
to frustrate Nixon in New Hampshire
and Wisconsin.

AN UNCERTAIN TRUMPET

Since Romney is now a professed
candidate, however, and his support-
ers must still find reasons for his nomi-
nation, it is pertinent to consider how
he would fare in a campaign against
Lyndon Johnson. Without reviving
the oft-reported account of Romney's
fumbling with the issues, I select for
illustration his performance on the
CBS "Face the Nation" program on
Nov. 19. He met on that occasion
three competent inquisitors who plied
him with highly pertinent questions
about Vietnam. One concerned Rom-
ney's idea that a solution lies in neu-
tralizing the whole area (presumably
North and South Vietnam), "taking
that area out of the cold war." That,
incidentally, would be like a sugges-
tion to Lincoln in 1862 that Virginia
and Washington be neutralized.

Q. Is there a specific program? You
say neutralization-
A. I am in the process of studying it
and developing it.

Romney then made the point that
the South Vietnamese should be made
to fight more.
Q. Suppose you were President and
they didn't?
A. We should cross that bridge
when we come to it.

Those answers characterize Rom-
ney's answers when he faces hard re-
alities for decision. Either he says he
must study some more or the problem
can wait for decision. He is really not
sure, clear and articulate about any
of the grim issues that are disturbing
Americans. How can Republicans ex-
pect a victory in 1968 when the tune
is called by this uncertain trumpet?

A SITTING DUCK FOR LBJ

For the next Presidential campaign
will not, like the last one, be a conflict
of ideologies. It will be a hard-hitting
debate over the tools essential to meet
American commitments abroad and at
home. The words "liberal," "conserva-
tive" or the blurred something called
"moderate" will have little relevance.
The Johnson cards are on the table.
And whoever challenges him must
match him point by point with viable
alternatives.

No Polonius can do that with a rou-
tine of homey platitudes. Nor can a
GOP candidate rely upon set speeches
prepared for him by an aggregation of
ghosts. It is incredible that Romney is
prepared to face such veteran cam-
paigners as LBJ and Humphrey and
also to meet, day after day, the merci-
less inquisition of the most numerous
and in part the most sophisticated
group of press representatives in the
world. The half-hour "Face the Na-
tion" performance shows how ill-pre-
pared he is for such a test.

It is equally incredible that Rom-
ney's lack of preparation is so glaring
after he has had more than two years
to inform himself on the vital issues
upon which the 1968 campaign will
be decided.

He should know, as he was remind-
ed, that neutralization means surren-
der to Communism on the installment
plan. And when he says, taking a cue
from Robert Kennedy, that the South
Vietnamese military forces are not
bearing their share of the burden, that
charge is shattered by General West-
moreland and Ambassador Bunker.

Indeed, Romney himself is incredi-
ble, considering how badly his scanty
knowledge and foggy faculties fail to
meet the range of his pretensions.

**PERSPECTIVE**

**A LOOK BEYOND THE WAR**

**BY RAYMOND MOLEY**

Richard Nixon's contribution to the
multilogue on Vietnam looks be-
yond enlisting support for his nomina-
tion, for he is giving his party a foreign
policy fit for all seasons, an asset the
GOP needs as it looks toward 1968.
For this, Republicans should consider
themselves deeply in his debt.
The President will be very hard to
beat in 1968 if the limited objectives
of our military effort are achieved in
the next ten months. In that case LBJ
will emerge as something of a hero
and something of a seer. Pollsters will
revise their popularity ratings, party
critics will subside, Democrats will
unite and loud hosannas will rise from
the populace.
The Republican Party will need a
spokesman who not only is broadly ex-
perienced in foreign affairs but who
has a viable set of views about the Far
Pacific and Asia. This must not only
encompass support for a war which
has cost the United States so much
but look beyond the war to the re-
sponsibilities of the United States.
Any Republican possibility who fa-
vors either our isolation from the per-
imeter of China or the obliteration of
North Vietnam could not possibly pre-
vail against the President, whatever
may happen during the next year.
Among the GOP aspirants, Richard
Nixon is unique in his firsthand, long-
term study of Asia and the Pacific, in
his comprehension of the objectives of
the Communist system and the fears
and hopes and interests of the still
non-Communist countries on the pe-
riphery of eastern Asia.

**NIXON'S EXPERIENCE**

Fourteen years ago, after a mission
in which he visited those places, in-
cluding Hanoi and Saigon, he warned
Americans of the plight of Southeast
Asia and favored some help to the
beleaguered French. Secretary Dul-
les and Joint Chiefs chairman Radford
agreed with him. Radford, except for
MacArthur, was our most experienced
military leader in Asiatic and Pacific
affairs. But the President hesitated,
France withdrew and there emerged
the succession of events which ended
in our armed intervention.
Nixon's position then and now has
been that with the Communist system
-either Russia or China or both-dom-
inant in Southeast Asia, the gateway
to the Indian Ocean would be ex-
posed and all the countries on the per-
imeter, from Japan to Australia and
India, would be menaced by Commu-
nist military aggression and economic
exploitation. That would be the pre-
liminary to World War III.
Nixon's judgment of our present
military effort is that never has so
much power been so ineffectively
used. But if we prevail despite our
mistakes, any settlement must avoid
two extremes. One is a phony neu-
tralization of South Vietnam. The
other is the creation of a vacuum in
North Vietnam, into which Red China
would certainly move. And Russia
would demand compensation for its
present involvement, which has con-
tributed 100 per cent of Hanoi's oil
and 80 per cent of its sophisticated
weapons.

**CANNOT ACCEPT ISOLATION**

But, Nixon says, the foreign policy
of a great power like ours must look
beyond the war to its aftermath. For
war in this instance, as always, is a
temporary crisis in the long processes
of diplomatic policy. Most of our wars
have created problems greater than
those for which we took up arms.
Our sea, air and economic power
impose responsibilities in the long fu-
ture in non-Communist Asia. We can-
not escape this. And safety for the
non-Communist world in the Pacific
will demand new efforts to create mu-
tual interests and mutual aid among
those countries. This would be a sub-
stitute for SEATO, which was virtu-
ally imposed from Europe (which
has now just about abandoned the
Far East) and the United States. In
that postwar era the United States
must provide encouragement, eco-
nomic aid and military protection.
While our stand in Vietnam has done
much to convince those countries that
Communism is not necessarily the
wave of the future, they will need
help for a considerable time. We can-
not accept isolation when our interests
and those of the countries of the free
world are involved.
It is not Communist China alone
that is the great future threat. Rus-
sia, with the mobility of its vast new
maritime strength and its designs for
economic and ideological penetration,
will be a permanent power in the
Pacific. This must be balanced by our
own presence and our own concern
for the protection of the independ-
ence of the countries involved.
Nixon's view of the future should
also be the policy of his party.

PORTRAIT OF THE GOP
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

Thirty-seven years have passed since the electorate in the
Congressional elections of 1930 handed a vote of no
confidence to the Republican Party. When we realize that a
new generation has come of age since then, it is obvious why
those people who shape public opinion have portrayed the GOP
as an object of pity, scorn, contempt and ridicule. Most of
the active articulate people in the communications media, in
college classrooms, in the pulpit, in Congress and in the
studies where political books are written are within the age
span of 25 to 55. Thus, political evaluations are pregnant
with the prejudices and preconceptions of the period when
those people came of age. A great proportion were either
unborn or in grammar school when FDR was elected.

In writing of the Republican Party they conveniently ignore
the years when the GOP was shaping national policy, mostly
for the better. For as we review the years when these people
knew public affairs at firsthand, the record of the GOP was
that of defeats, internal conflict and sectionalism. Because
of the party's minority status, it lacked any lasting
legislative or executive achievement.

It is refreshing, even inspiring, to find two writers of the
post-New-Deal era who, breaking away from the prejudices of
their contemporaries, portray the Republican Party as a
vital institution quite worthy of offering itself as an
alternative in a political system in which liberty, progress
and national health and security can be guaranteed only by a
strong two-party system.

ACCENT ON ORGANIZATION

These writers are Stephen Hess and David S. Broder. Their
book is "The Republican Establishment: The Present and
Future of the G.O.P."* The authors are neither ideologues
nor apologists. The book is written to inform and guide an
electorate that faces a year in which it must make great
decisions.

These authors are distinctive among political writers who
prefer to deal only with candidates and issues. They begin
with an appraisal of the GOP as an organization or, rather,
a number of organizations: the Congressional leadership, the
National Committee, the state governors and the splinter
groups on the periphery. They show

*440 pages. Harper & Row. $7.95.

in a vividly interesting way how chairman Ray Bliss uses the
machinery of the National Committee to build a firm
grass-roots base for party success.

Then, since politics is people and leaders of people, there
are lengthy profiles of the Presidential aspirants-Romney,
Nixon, Percy, Reagan-and other figures in Congress and in
the Statehouses. Here the portraiture is full, perceptive
and scrupulously fair. In delineating these figures in the
news, nothing is extenuated, or is aught "set down in
malice."

DECLINE OF THE EAST

Finally, the great regions are examined-East, South, Middle
West and West. There was a time in Republican history when
only the Eastern Establishment, with its great financial and
political base, and the Middle West, rooted in industry,
counted in choosing candidates and shaping party policy. But
now, as the authors show, the South and West must be
reckoned with. For political influence has followed the
drift of the population and economic power. The political
dominance of the East exists no longer, despite its
importance as the center of the communications media and its
considerable community of "intellectuals" and writers.

The decline of the East, the authors say, is dramatic. In
fifteen years its share of Republican governors has dropped
from eight to five; in House seats, from 74 to 48. Maine,
Vermont and Connecticut have Democratic governors. The East
cannot recapture its past.

The brighter outlook for the GOP as 1968 approaches is in
the results of the 1966 recovery. Nothing contributed so
much to that recovery as the sane policies of leadership in
Congress, the quiet labors of Ray Bliss with the "nuts and
bolts" of party organization, the indefatigable campaigning
of Richard Nixon and the dawning reality that the Great
Society as envisioned by President Johnson only proves that
this country is too big to be governed completely from
Washington.

But opposition parties never win. The incumbents fail. And
therein lies the speculation that shrouds the outcome in
1968. For if the President succeeds in repelling the
Communist thrust into Southeast Asia, it will be difficult
for even a revitalized. GOP to dislodge him.

**PERSPECTIVE**

**ROCKEFELLER-REAGAN?**

**BY RAYMOND MOLEY**

A leading member of the Reagan-for-President hopefuls has
explained his preference in terms of "maturity." Ronald
Reagan, he said, is more mature and sophisticated than was
Barry Goldwater in 1964. But he quickly added that his
people would find both Nelson Rockefeller and George Romney
"totally unacceptable."

The relative maturities of the various Republican
Presidential possibilities is not the subject of this piece.
But the maturity and sophistication of those who are
promoting a Reagan boom are quite pertinent to any appraisal
of current calculations in the GOP. Those conservatives who
would plunge Reagan into the contest for the nomination are
doing exactly what many veteran Rockefeller supporters hope
for. Since that hope includes the defeat of Richard Nixon,
it is believed that the outcome would be a
Rockefeller-Reagan ticket. This, it is anticipated, would
provide for them the best of two GOP worlds.

Five weeks ago, a highly sagacious Republican politician
told me that as the cause of Romney fades out, Rockefeller
strategists, in order to eliminate Nixon, will promote the
fortunes of Reagan. Their purpose would be not the
nomination of Reagan, but to give Rockefeller a chance to
emerge as the Presidential candidate. And by adding Reagan
to a Rockefeller ticket, to win support of enough
conservative strength to win the election. In these
calculations it is assumed that, regardless of what may
happen in early primaries, the Republican convention will
not nominate Romney.

**STRANGE BEDFELLOWS**

This seemed to be highly speculative, even improbable. But
since then, certain bits of the complex puzzle have begun to
fall into place. More than one of the people identifiably
close to the Rockefeller organization has spoken openly of
the attractiveness of a Rockefeller-Reagan ticket. The
refrain has been echoed in various powerful media of
communication in the East. And a poll showing
Rockefeller-Reagan running even with Johnson-Humphrey has
appeared.

A Vice Presidential nomination used to be regarded as a
necessary but politically useless addition to a ticket. The
Presidential candidate was for real. The Vice Presidential
candidate was to lure the unwary. But John F. Kennedy's
selection of Lyndon B. Johnson for second place is still
believed to have assured the margin of victory. That is why
liberal strategists believe Reagan to be indispensable to a
Rockefeller candidacy.

Nothing much can be done about the young conservatives who
are pasting Reagan-for-President stickers on their car
bumpers. Boys will be boys. Their "movement," however, is
not altogether innocent, for among them are certain elders
who have always been hostile toward Nixon. Nor are the
Easterners who are talking about a Rockefeller-Reagan ticket
disingenuous. Both groups, worlds apart in their
philosophies, are intent upon eliminating Nixon.

**THE DECISIVE KEYS**

There are two factors which are the keys to the ultimate
decision. One is the mood of the prospective delegates who
will answer to the roll call in 1968. For there will be a
large majority of delegates from the Midwest, the West and
the South. These made up the preponderant vote that
nominated Goldwater in 1964. There is good evidence that
they will absolutely refuse to nominate Rockefeller or
Romney, regardless of what happens in the early primaries.

The other factor is Reagan himself. On the one hand, there
are a few people close to him who are urging him to seek the
Presidential nomination. He is ambitious. Who isn't? The
aforementioned young conservatives look to him as the
redeemer of the 1964 lost cause. His platform appearances
ignite great enthusiasm. And audiences are a heady narcotic.

On the other hand, a great many of his 1966 supporters in
California want him to continue in his job as governor. His
equipment to campaign against LBJ, he must realize, is
limited. To enter the New Hampshire primary would hurt Nixon
and antagonize Nixon supporters. A contest with Nixon might
well split the GOP once more. Reagan's own current
disposition is to reject any movement for him in the New
Hampshire primary and perhaps in Wisconsin. He has given
assurance that he will positively refuse to take second
place on a Rockefeller or Romney ticket. He says that oil
and water don't mix. But if all others fail by convention
time, who can refuse a party demand?

That is how it looks at this time, in September 1967.
