PERSPECTIVE

MR. BYRNES' VIEWS

BY RAYMOND MOLEY

A s a wise contribution to the mul-
tilogue now going on concerning
the future of conservatism in general
and the two-party system in particular, I have asked an old friend and
elder statesman how it looks to him
from the impartiality of his well-
earned retirement. The career of
James F. Byrnes—"Mr." Byrnes in his
state—has not been equaled in its
variety in American history. He was
a member of the House for fourteen
years, a senator for twelve years, a
Supreme Court Justice for more than
a year, director of economic stabilization and war mobilization for President Roosevelt in the war years,
Secretary of State in the Truman Administration, and, finally, governor of
South Carolina for four years.
No one—repeat, no one—in Congress did as much to secure the enactment of the early New Deal
legislation, and Byrnes was then a
junior senator. His immense school-
building program when he was governor of his state has saved South
Carolina from the racial disturbances
which have afflicted so much of the
South. His record is the antithesis of
reaction. And his wise counsel, uttered as it is without personal ambition or advantage, is most pertinent
at this time:
"The funeral dirge over the Republican Party is premature. The Republican Party was supposed to die
after 1912 and also after 1936. But
it recovered. After the Harding landslide in 1920 the Democratic Party
had only 88 members in the House.
This minority faithfully attended
committee meetings and sessions and
through its record of constructive opposition recovered in the election of
Roosevelt in 1932.

DEMOCRATIC DIFFERENCES

"I am an independent Democrat.
In 1952 I supported General Eisenhower. In 1956 I voted for electors
pledged to Sen. Harry F. Byrd. In
1960 I supported Richard Nixon and
in 1964 Senator Goldwater. As an
independent Democrat I believe that
constructive opposition is good both
for the incumbent Administration and
for the minority.
"Speaking as an American I hope
the Republican Party will unite and
carry on the fight for conservative
constitutional government. Republicans now can take heart from the
knowledge that there are varying
views in the ranks of their opponents.
And these differences will soon appear in the Democratic Party.
"President Johnson, after his inauguration, will become a candidate for
re-election in 1968. He will make an
effort to fulfill pledges of the Democratic platform which was adopted
only after his approval. Inevitably
there will appear serious differences
among his supporters.

NO ADVISORY COMMITTEE

"The Democratic platform pledges
its candidates to repeal Section 14-b
of the Taft-Hartley Act, under which
twenty states have enacted right-to-
work laws. Fulfilling this will arouse
little enthusiasm among the 50 big-
business men who ostentatiously
called upon the President with a
promise of support at the polls.
"With a big majority of Democrats
in both House and Senate the President should have no trouble in redeeming his promises. He has
hundreds of appointments to make
in offices of great importance. This
power of appointment gives the President great power and he does not
balk at the exercise of power.
"Moreover, should questions of
constitutionality arise, the Supreme
Court has a tendency to share
the President's social and economic
views. And four of the present Justices will be eligible for retirement
during the next four years.
"Proposals for the appointment of
a Republican advisory committee
have been made. This kind of arrangement was tried by the Democrats some years ago and it failed.
Congressional leaders are most competent to make policy. And they
should, of course, consult with Senator Goldwater as the titular leader
of his party, with members of the
national committee, and Republican
governors, if possible. But policy
should be announced in Congress.
"In the days ahead, the opposition
in Congress should earn the right to
be called the 'loyal opposition,' and
all who disagree with the ultra-liberal views of the President and
Vice President should support that
opposition."

**VIEWS OF A VETERAN**

**BY RAYMOND MOLEY**

John W. Bricker, recalling his days in the Senate, commented after this year's election that the chaplain of that body once said in his prayer: "God give us a mandate higher than the ballot box." In the light of recent events, Bricker meant that the voters did not accept the Johnson program, but, rather, rejected what they were led to believe Goldwater might do if elected. The issues that really concern the people were hardly debated at all.

I have sought Bricker's views on the GOP's future because no one in the past has so clearly appraised the thinking of Ohio voters—and Ohio ever since the Civil War has most accurately reflected national sentiment. And Bricker, freed from further quest of public office and with his mind enriched by long experience in politics, is able to make the long and impartial estimates so necessary to the party's future.

The Eastern press has never accorded Bricker the credit he has deserved. This has been because the late Robert A. Taft held the center of the stage so long. And Bricker loyally supported Taft's three tries for the nomination. Taft was called Mr. Republican. But Bricker deserved the title of Mr. Ohio. He has always held a warm place in the hearts of Republican leaders throughout the country.

In 1944, when he was a candidate in his own right and Dewey won the nomination, the Republicans, with an enthusiasm and unanimity I had never seen in a convention, gave Bricker second place on the ticket.

**WISE FORECASTER**

He won successive elections in Ohio—first as attorney general, three times as governor, and twice as United States senator. In 1958 when he narrowly lost, he had warned certain businessmen not to put right-to-work on the ballot that year. His forebodings were amply justified.

On many occasions I have sought Bricker's predictions before elections. In 1950 when all the newspapermen in Ohio predicted Taft's defeat, Bricker told me they were wrong. And they were. In 1960, when the press gave Ohio to Kennedy, Bricker gave the approximate majority which Nixon actually received. In 1962 he guessed, two weeks before the election, the number of Congressional seats the GOP would win and the ones that they would lose. He was proved right.

His uncanny sense of voter opinion in Ohio commends his views on what the GOP should consider in seeking a comeback. For while Ohio has large industrial centers, the decision usually follows what happens in the suburbs, the smaller communities, and the rural counties.

**CONTINUING CONCERNS**

"I have seen the time," he says, "when the Republican Party had fewer governors and a lower membership in Congress than it will have in 1965." After the great defeat in 1936 the reaction came in 1938, when Bricker and Taft were both elected in Ohio and there was a strong Republican tide over the nation. "Certainly," he added, "this is no time to quarrel about who is to be blamed for losing this election. It is too early to hold conferences of leaders, real or pseudo. Surely, those who would rule or ruin the Republican Party should not be charged with rebuilding it. A Republican program must come from internal reconciliation of opposing viewpoints."

It is Bricker's opinion that there is still deep concern over the immense increase of Presidential power which may follow this landslide. Congress will for the time respond to the President's wishes. The people are also concerned about the Supreme Court's invasion of the realm of policy-making. This centers upon the questions of school prayer and reapportionment, which must come before the next Congress in the form of constitutional amendments.

The reaction against "too much Johnson," Bricker believes, may come sooner than most of us think.

Meanwhile, he says, the Republican Party must rebuild not only in its own interest but in the interest of the two-party system, for the continuance of that system is essential to the preservation of representative republican government. History has repeatedly demonstrated that multiple parties lead to instability and anarchy and that a one-party system leads to tyranny.

**PERSPECTIVE**

**A PARTY'S NINE LIVES**

BY RAYMOND MOLEY

Among all the published comments about the GOP's future, those of
Richard Nixon make the most sense.  Moreover, he has richly earned the
right to be heard. No one except the candidates labored so hard in this
campaign—200 speeches in 36 states. And the narrow margin of his loss in
1960 shows that he and his views are most acceptable to the great majority
of Republican voters.

He is speaking in the interest of party unity, not in terms of "let us
have peace," but with reservations. For in the prospective regeneration
of the party he excludes a dominant voice for those who deserted the
ticket chosen at San Francisco—Rockefeller, Javits, Case of New
Jersey, Kuchel of California. By inference, therefore, he means that the
sectional faction which won the Presidential nominations in 1940, 1944,
1948, and 1952 must in the future play a minor part in party affairs.
That was decisively settled at the San Francisco convention this year.

By implication Nixon is saying also that any of the candidates who op-
posed Goldwater at or before the convention would have lost by an
even greater majority. The policies advanced by these dissidents and the
voting records of those who hold seats in Congress reveal ideological
positions so like those of the Democratic regime that such acquiescence
could never provide the choice so necessary to a two-party system.

**NEED FOR SPECIFICS**

Nixon gives voice to none of those recriminations against Gold-
water which have been so popular since the election. Goldwater, he
says, will retain influence in the GOP, "a good, constructive influence."

This suggests that the Goldwater following, after excluding the so-
called "radical right," is so dedicated to the views of the recent candidate
that no viable party can exist without its support.

The determination of future party policy is not so difficult as it seems.
It is well, in seeking measurable agreement, to dispense with such
generalities as "right," "far right," "left," "far left," and "moderate."
What is needed in determining party policy is specifics. Some of
these specifics are: How, by creating alternative programs suitable to a
strong opposition, can the drift to a centralized government be slowed
down and halted? How can the social-security system be rationalized
without losing the central purpose, which is to provide security for old
age? How can the waste in defense be cut without impairing the national
security? How can the income tax be revised in the interest of equity and
productivity? For the 1964 tax cut was at best a crudely conceived reform.
Is the GOP to accept without strong dissent the theory of this Administration
that there should be planned deficits and that such deficits are sound means
of economic growth? Standing on the firm principles embodied in the
Kerr-Mills Act, how can it be revised or administered in a way to eliminate
the demand for medicare attached to social security?


**STEPS TOWARD REVIVAL**

In foreign affairs, how should our fraying alliances be strengthened?
How should the foreign-aid program be reduced and administered? What
should be our posture toward the changing conditions in the Communist
world? How can the United States make secure a beachhead in Southeast
Asia without surrender to neutralization? What must be done in revising the
United Nations Charter to achieve the basic purposes for which the U.N. was
created?

There is need for a conference of GOP leaders intelligently to seek
agreement on the elements of a party faith. Such agreement will leave as
dissidents some who favor all-or-nothing policies. Some who dissent will
continue to support Democratic rather than Republican policies. Others
will remain irreconcilable in their belief that conservatism should oppose
everything that has happened in the past 30 years.

The Republican goal is not 1968. It is constructive opposition in Congress,
even with reduced numbers. And it is 1966, when some of the repairs after
the Johnson landslide can be achieved at the state and Congressional-district
level. For history teaches that after a landslide like this, there is a revival of the
opposition two years later.

**INDISPENSABLE DISSENT**

BY RAYMOND MOLEY

The egghead word for it has been
"consensus." Before the San Fran-
cisco convention it was used to urge
Republicans to take the middle way
and present a candidate whose views
were relatively indistinguishable from
the presently established regime in
Washington. The two parties, they
said, should be so alike that transition
from one to the other might be with-
out effort or pain.

After this course was rejected by
the convention, the theme changed.
A Republican consensus had failed;
it was necessary to national harmony
to "bury" the GOP candidates.

Lyndon Johnson took up the refrain
from the consensual Republicans. He
expressed the same aversion to dis-
sent, but used the word "content-
ment" or its equivalent. In his vision
of an era of good feeling, his encom-
passing arms embrace the Fords and
the Reuthers, Harvard and Texas, all
races, creeds, sections, and national-
ities. The vision of Isaiah comes to
mind, with the wolf, the lamb, the
leopard, the kid, the cow, and the
bear, the lion, and the ox all peace-
fully resting in the Federal corral,
with good old Lyndon passing out
the corn pone. This syrupy sentiment
evoked a great amen in the press,
the pulpit, the pundits, labor, and a
sizable sector of business.

The President has said that "unless
there is progress, there will be dis-
content." The truth written in history
is that without discontent there can
be no progress. The milk from con-
tented cows may nourish the body.
But the miasma created by a con-
tented people corrupts the spirit.

**NO ERA OF HARMONY**

We have heard before of "an era
of good feeling." That is what the
second term of Monroe was called
after that President had been re-
elected by a vote which lacked
unanimity by one. But in the early
1820s the two parties were shattered
by factionalism. Crazy speculation
west of the Appalachians brought to
the inhabitants inflation, bankruptcy,
and distress. The Missouri Compro-
mise deferred but did not solve the
slavery question. In the East the
Bank of the United States brought
corruption into the Senate itself.
Latin America exploded in revolution

and great imperial powers of Europe
moved in for the kill. It was the end
of an era and the beginning of the
revolution which centered in Andrew
Jackson, who was called worse names
than were applied to Goldwater.

But the national growth which
followed until 1860 found vital
nourishment in dissent. Nonconform-
ity was the very spirit of those who
came from the Old World to this
new land. My old professor at
Columbia reminded his class that
America was populated by "kickers."
The 1964 equivalent of that word is
"kooks." The belief that dissent can
be purged by a debacle at the polls
is fatuous sophistry. The questions
about the past 30 years of liberalism
raised in this campaign will not die
in November. They go to the very
essence of our national character,
purpose, and destiny.

**THE DIFFERENCES REMAIN**

The revolution which swept the
Republican Party in San Francisco
may not yet provide the essential
talent for government. But so long as
the vigor of dissent remains-and it
will remain-it will shape the political
patterns of the future.

Goldwater rejected wholly the
concept that Americans can be satis-
fied with only those material means
which can be bestowed by a paternal
government. He pointed to a differ-
ent sort of war on poverty-the need
for a war against that poverty of
spirit that manifests itself in compla-
cent acceptance of bribes in the form
of indiscriminate subsidies. The polit-
ical trickery of passing on the burden
of costs to another generation is be-
coming quite obvious to those who
must shoulder that burden.

The need for dissent, I feel confi-
dent, will soon appear even to those
who have been frightened by what
is called Goldwaterism. It is not
merely the man Goldwater that was
involved in this decision. It may well
be the principles and policies for
which the President asked a mandate.
So long as dissent is abroad in the
land, the health of the nation is as-
sured. For the shaping of the future
is not within the power or province of
any one man or one temporary regime.
The right of dissent is an attribute
of freedom.

PERSPECTIVE

NIXON'S ROLE IN 1964

BY RAYMOND MOLEY

If the acclaim now given by conservative people to Richard Nixon for his campaign over the nation in support of the Goldwater-Miller ticket had been accorded him by those same people in 1960, he would now be running for re-election as President, and John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson would be senators from their respective states.

In 1960 there were altogether too many conservative people who were dampening Nixon's chances by complaints that he was not conservative enough, or that he should say this or that which he did not say, or that his campaign was badly managed, or that he did badly in his debates with his opponent. I have no doubt that this halfhearted support or nonsupport of Nixon in that year lost him the margin of victory.

It was useless then to argue with those conservatives. They did not seem to realize that the choice in 1960 was real and vital and important to the future of the nation. It was not realized then that while his relationship with the Eisenhower Administration was something of an asset, it was also a great liability. For he could not then state frankly that it was a State Department "clique" that helped Castro attain power in Cuba.

Nor could he respond when candidate Kennedy suggested that an invasion of Cuba by refugees would be desirable, for such an invasion plan was already under way and was top secret. Nor could he respond to the conservatives' complaint about President Eisenhower's neglect of his party's welfare.

RECORD OF LOYALTY

Now, however, he is under no such restraints. The old clichés about the "old" or the "new" Nixon are irrelevant now. He has always been the same, essentially conservative, and a supporter of the Republican Party in victory and defeat.

In the Congressional campaigns in 1954 and 1958 he battled in many states in the very teeth of defeat. I remember well how hard he tried to stem a crushing defeat for the Republican ticket in California in 1958, because I was out there and witnessed his efforts. He battled in Ohio and in many other states for losing causes. Those efforts are well remembered by hard-pressed Republican state leaders, and that is why Nixon's campaigning now is such a boost to their morale. The sharp contrast between the attitude of Nixon now and that of the neutralism of the Romneys and the restraint of the Rockefellers will not be forgotten. Nixon's role in the future of the Republican Party and his image before the nation as a statesman of the first rank will be assured.

FIGHTING FOR UNITY

The wisdom of his move from California to New York is now apparent. For he can speak not merely from one state but on a national platform. Even more than General Eisenhower, he is able to heal the wounds in the GOP inflicted at San Francisco and before. He is not, as it were, getting into the fight "to pick up the pieces." He is convinced that Goldwater can win if the issues are vigorously exploited. Nor is he moved by the possibility of his own nomination in 1968. For Nixon is a realist. If Goldwater wins, that nomination will be foreclosed, and if Goldwater loses, no one can tell now what the unpredictable course of public and party preference will be.

In his campaigning Nixon has already effectively blunted the sharpest issue of the opponents of Goldwater: irresponsibility and recklessness in suggesting the delegation of authority to use atomic weapons. Nixon bears testimony as one who, as a member of the Eisenhower inner circle, was privy to a plan for such delegation in certain contingencies, as reassurance to our NATO allies and for the protection of our slim forces in Europe against attack by overwhelming Soviet hordes. His challenge to the President to say whether that plan has been abandoned cannot be said to violate security, for the matter is now an unkept "secret."

It is well for this great debate that Nixon has not chosen, as other former Republican candidates for President and Vice President have chosen, to vanish behind the green shades of a law office, or to remain silent or to advocate splitting the ticket in favor of Johnson-Humphrey. He has raised a standard of unity and hope for a beleaguered GOP.
