**PERSPECTIVE**

**Will They Believe It?**

*by Raymond Moley*

WHEN I was a small boy a story
went the rounds about a man
who rushed up from the quarry
where he worked and entered the
bank. He had heard some ugly ru-
mors. He said to the cashier in a
loud voice: "If my money's here I
don't want it. If it isn't here I want
it!" A boy's mind regarded that story
as sheer amusement. But with the
years I came to realize this man was
expressing a basic truth which condi-
tions all economic calculations.

In the late 1930s when deficits
persisted and the national debt rose,
the question was often asked
whether a $65 billion debt was too
much. Someone answered that the
figure was unimportant. For any figure
was too high if a large majority of
Americans believed it to be too high.
Despite the pretentious use of fig-
ures, charts, and theorems, economics
still falls short of status as a science.
The imponderables of public psy-
chology must be reckoned with. The
measurement of public opinion, de-
spite all the polls and all the labors
of the "weevils of research," still
eludes exactness.

We work better, think better, feel
better, and produce more when we
have confidence in the future. Some-
times that confidence is based upon
an illusion. But while the illusion re-
mains, the results are real. Children
are better children as long as they
believe Santa Claus will reward them.

**KENNEDY'S GAMBLE**

The first major measures enacted by
Congress after Franklin D. Roosevelt
entered the White House in 1933
were an emergency banking act and
a drastic cut in the budget. These
restored confidence in the banking
system and in the fiscal responsibility
of the Federal government. In the
minds of Americans something was
awakened which had failed to re-
spond to the earnest and sincere ex-
hortations during three and a half
years of the Hoover Administration.
It was true, and the President knew
this as well as anyone, that there still
remained grave dislocations in the
economy after those initial measures
were passed. The heavy industries
remained stagnant. Railroads either
hovered on the brink of bankruptcy
or were already in the courts. Private
debts were excessive. Agriculture
rested, as Candidate Roosevelt had
put it months before, "in the shadow
of peasantry." Despite the fact that
most banks had been reopened, some
were still, as Jesse Jones bluntly told
a bankers' convention, actually insol-
vent. But recovery took shape, and
the gross national product was to rise
at a rate of 10 per cent a year until
1936. And unemployment declined.
President Kennedy, in planning a
series of immense deficits, is gambling
on the capacity of his Administration
to make people believe that Federal
extravagance can produce great pros-
perity. The arguments for planned
deficits are expounded at length in
the Budget Message and the Eco-
nomic Report. What remains is to
convince people that these arguments
and calculations are valid.

**FDR'S METHOD**

Walter W. Heller, chief of the
President's Board of Economic Ad-
visers, told the Congressional Joint
Economic Committee that the success
of the new policy would depend
upon "education." But despite the
great importance of a public willing
to believe in planned deficits, there
is still room to wonder whether the
sort of brainwashing which is used to
produce a consensus is wise. For it
largely consists of derogatory char-
acterizations of concepts and princi-
ples deeply embedded in American
minds. Roosevelt's method was to ex-
plain why his emergency measures
were in fact extensions and supports
for the copybook maxims. He was, he
said, saving capitalism, encouraging
thrift by practicing it in the Federal
government, and providing security
for the investment necessary to
growth. If he believed that the copy-
book maxims were myths, he was cer-
tainly wise enough not to say so.

But Dr. Heller told the Congres-
sional committee that people who op-
posed his views were "puritanical."
There is, however, a lot of Puritanism
among Americans. They don't like to
hear that Benjamin Franklin is old
hat. Nor that their frugal virtues in
these more "enlightened" days are
myths. Derision is not persuasion, nor
is it education.
