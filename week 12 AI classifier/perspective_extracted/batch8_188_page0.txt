**Perspective**

**Government by Men**

Not much is said publicly about it, but there are people in organized labor who would shed no tears if a drastic revision of the Wagner Labor Relations Act eliminated the board feature of that Act completely. These people are at last beginning to see what friendly critics pointed out five years ago when the Act was up for consideration—that placing such enormous powers in the hands of a board practically put a governmental harness on the labor movement. This arrangement, it was pointed out, would work all right so long as a pro-labor Administration remained in power in Washington. But the moment a politically conservative reaction set in, the shoe would be on the other foot.

It is easy to see now, after five years’ experience, exactly how that can happen. If a board like the present one can exercise enormous discretionary powers in behalf of labor, another kind of board can go just as far in the other direction.

Perhaps the labor leaders who favored the enactment of the Labor Act realized this. But they thought that the organization of labor in this country could be accomplished before Roosevelt left office. They foolishly looked upon the completion of their plans as a two- or four-year job, though wiser people pointed out that it looked more like a ten- or twenty-year job. At any rate, their dilemma now is to choose between the risk of a hostile board under a possible new Administration, or to take what they have gained, hold it, and depend upon, say, the Department of Justice for the enforcement of the general provisions of the Wagner Act.

The whole Wagner Act setup is a cast-iron system in some respects and a jelly structure in others. The result has been that policies, in their actual bearing on industrial conditions, had to be made by the members. The execution of the vague ideas written into the law became a government of men rather than of laws.

Similarly, the Securities and Exchange Acts dumped a large body of quasi-law-making upon the SEC, and, there, changes in personnel have brought changes in policy. Broadly, the SEC has shifted from a fairly limited concern with enforcing the “truth in securities” idea to a rather intensive concern with the actual management of various enterprises. Some of this shift may be a natural evolution. But, in the main, it seems to stem from differences in the social and economic philosophies of Kennedy and Landis in the beginning, and Douglas and Frank later.

Yet where the SEC, despite shifts in personnel, was slow to develop policies, the NLRB rushed ahead. Demands upon it were far more numerous, far more urgent. Confronted with choices between the vertical and horizontal unions, it got crosswise first with the AFL and, latterly, with Mr. Lewis and the CIO.

The snarl, of course, embarrassed Roosevelt. To reform this particular government by men, he put in William M. Leiserson. Left alone, Leiserson could doubtless have accomplished something. But he had to contend with the two senior members of the NLRB. Nevertheless, even if Leiserson had controlled the Board, he would have run into trouble because a board that has to choose between all the forms of labor organization and their jealous adherents probably has an impossible problem.

This form of government of labor relations could be made to work in a totalitarianism where the Board would be responsible to a hierarchy of officials and where members could be removed when they began to embarrass the regime seriously. Here we have attempted a compromise between independent commissions, which sometimes work in a democracy, and policy-forming in a field new to government on a scale old-fashioned labor leaders cannot accept.

Even if the Labor Board survives with its present law and present personnel, its own pappy won’t be able to recognize its manners after the present investigation is over. If, as seems more likely, the Wagner Act is not immediately amended but the Board’s personnel is changed, its wards can anticipate some bitterly unhappy developments. If the Republicans win the next election, then the hold-over New Dealers in Congress will try to revise the law and reduce the Board’s power or even eliminate the Board itself.


**Midwinter Tension**

For the first time in seven years, midwinter finds the Administration off the front page in the active, positive sense. It is there as the object of badgering by others, as the target of Mr. Dewey’s speeches, the subject of the political predictions of Messrs. Lewis, Wheeler and Farley. But it seems either to have lost its capacity for dashing, news-worthy action or to be deliberately lying low, particularly on domestic matters. In any case, it has ceased to carry the ball—to make headlines itself.

So we have an unannounced, unheralded breathing spell of sorts. But it is a breathing spell that provides comfort and stimulus neither to business nor to anyone else. Because nobody expects it to last. Nobody thinks this Administration can psychologically bear inaction and neglect for long. Already there is talk of the “war of nerves” in Washington—of grumbling, restlessness and straining at the leash within the Administration.

The things the Administration might do on the domestic front it is not disposed to attempt as it goes into an election year. That leaves the foreign field for action. And the feeling is growing, through the East, that the Administration is waiting and watching for a “crisis,” and “emergency” in foreign affairs.

Ernest K. Lindley, head of NEWSWEEK’S Washington bureau, has expressed it bluntly. Mr. Lindley says that the Presidential quietude bespeaks a new appeal for peace in Europe, and he believes the appeal will probably come before March 1st. The President’s preoccupation with foreign affairs, according to Mr. Lindley, prompted one of his followers to say: “His mind is so filled with affairs abroad that there is hardly a cranny left where thoughts of home affairs can lodge.”

It is certainly clear that spring will thaw out the war in Western Europe—that spring will bring its own inevitable crisis. If a successful peace effort is to be made at all within the next year, it must be made before that happens.

No one who understands the workings of Mr. Roosevelt’s mind doubts that he would rather be the prime mover in ending the war than any other single thing in the world. Not the least of Mr. Roosevelt’s characteristics is his admiration for his distinguished predecessor, Teddy Roosevelt, who, in 1905, waved the wand of peace that brought Russian and Japanese diplomats to Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Without in any sense discounting the wholeheartedness and sincerity of Mr. Roosevelt’s desire, it should be pointed out that another Portsmouth would incidentally pop the Presidency into Mr. Roosevelt’s bag again. Hundreds of thousands of those who consider his continuance in office the greatest of all possible calamities would vote for him because, however hostile they may be, they prefer Roosevelt to war. Millions would find their third-term qualms swept away by the magnificence of such an accomplishment.

Be that as it may, you can safely count on a crisis’ bringing the Presidential news out of the doldrums before spring.
