**Poll 'Em and Scare 'Em**

**by Raymond Moley**

LONDON—Two conditions in this general election forbid prophecy to an American. Both pertain to the well-remembered Missouri waltz of 1948. Candidate Dewey, tranquilized by Dr. Gallup and Elmo Roper, dropped his fighting role and spoke softly. Also beguiled by his brains trust, he did not attack the New Deal. There was no real issue, and millions of Republicans failed to vote.

The two major parties here propose essentially the same thing. Other factors, such as a superior Conservative constituency organization, may be decisive. But many may not vote. In that case, anything may happen. British press naïveté concerning the polls ill befits a politically sophisticated nation. But in conciseness of argument and in local organization it must be said that the British are a generation ahead of Americans.

Five newspapers here headline polls. According to the *Sunday Observer*, four of these emanate from the Gallup office, which canvasses with different teams for each paper. Each paper then interprets the figures for itself. The *Daily Express* has its own poll. All show a good margin for the Conservatives. This is one prescription for apathy.

**MORE FOR EVERYBODY**

The promises of the two parties are so similar that there is little reason for excitement. But there is pointing with alarm at the inflation that looms behind political proposals, and there is growing fright. Macmillan seized the offensive by demanding that Labor explain where the money was to come from to pay for the promised benefits.

Neither of the two leaders, Macmillan and Gaitskell, has the color of a Churchill or the motherly charm of "You Can Trust Mr. Attlee." Macmillan, called by one commentator "a Christmas tree of a man," is the spirit of a bountiful assortment of wonderful promises. His bank balance and social eminence are forgotten as he strikes homey poses on middle-class backdrops.

Gaitskell's fine intellect is locked in a shelter of compromise within the Labor Party. He also lacks a sense of humor. After promising to renationalize steel and road haulage, he is at pains to say there will be no more of such socialism. The welfare promises cover familiar ground: More for pensions, education, housing, old age, and youth. Gaitskell's plan for financing these has got him into trouble. Labor asserts that with more spending there will be more production and more to tax. That is what American liberals like Leon Keyserling are saying. It remains to be proved. But the British Conservatives can point to a record of greater production with limited spending.

One might ask where the Conservatives will find the money to pay for their super-market of benefits. These run from more sewage disposal to more doctors and dentists—more for all, from birth to dissolution.

**BAITED HOOK**

On foreign affairs, Labor points with horror to Suez and Nyasaland. Most people seem to believe that the Conservatives were right to attack Egypt and, like most of us, don't know where Nyasaland is. Aneurin Bevan implies that Labor could get on better with Khrushchev. But when Mr. K was here, the Labor leaders had a battle royal with him just as our union leaders had in San Francisco.

The agreement of President Eisenhower for a summit is fully exploited by the Conservatives. Macmillan claims that he prepared the way with his white fur hat in Russia. The Conservatives imply that they would get on better with the United States—which literally means better in doing in Uncle Sam.

Both Labor and Conservatives promise help to some industries. If this promise should be fulfilled, greater public ownership would result. But after the disastrous trial of socialism under the Labor government before 1951, no reasonable person expects either party to carry out much public ownership. Politicians simply do not want to run industry.

Thus, the Socialists are no longer socialist, and the Conservatives are no longer conservative. The middle class, which Marx assigned to oblivion, has grown bigger and bigger because the rich are poorer and the poor are better off. Both parties are baiting the hook for that middle-class vote.
