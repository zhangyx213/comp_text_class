**Perspective**

**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

**Frankenstein, M. C.**

No one seems to know exactly how many Federal commissions and agencies exist. Congressmen have guessed at 130. The American Bar Association says 115. The learned Committee on Administrative Management appointed by the President some time back was not definite.

No one knows how many regulations these seemingly countless Federal commissions and agencies have issued. All we know is that these regulations would, if collected, cover some 20,000 pages. This is more, in volume, than all the laws passed by Congress since 1789.

These regulations include 5,000 different prohibitions upon ways of doing business. The violation of any one of them is a crime. Yet they are not collected in any one place where citizens may consult them. In 1938, Congress provided money to collect and codify them. In two years only one-quarter of them have been codified. Meanwhile that codification itself has become out of date. New regulations have been pouring out so fast that the collectors could not catch up. Talk about Hydra's heads!

Having produced this monstrous aggregation of rule-making commissions and agencies, Congress, like Frankenstein, appears incapable of finding a way to control its creature. It has now spent over two years kicking around the only measure that has a chance to regulate the regulators—the Walter-Logan Bill.

The purpose of this bill is "to prevent administrative absolutism." It makes possible a judicial review not only of the rules laid down by administrative agencies but of the facts in individual cases. Essentially it gives the citizen recourse to the Federal courts as a protection against a process by which the combined functions of prosecutor, judge, jury and executioner are lodged in the same bureaucrats.

Committees of the Senate and House began considering this bill more than two years ago. The House passed it on April 18, 1940. The Senate had passed a somewhat different version of it on July 18, 1939, but, shortly after, Senators Barkley and Minton had maneuvered to get it returned to the calendar. There it rests, together with the House version and a favorable report from the Senate Judiciary Committee.

The bureaucrats and their spokesmen have made every effort to hinder its passage. To possibly legitimate criticisms of detail have been added the most sweeping objections that no "single formula or set of formulas" can properly regulate the bureaucratic agencies. To the initial maneuverings of Senators Barkley and Minton has been added a series of flagrantly obstructionist moves. Twice the Senate has been asked to delay action until it gets a report on the bill from a committee appointed by the Attorney General. Twice the dates on which the report was supposed to have been presented have gone by without so much as a sight of the report. More than twice the Administration has tried to get Congress to go home, knowing full well that the Walter-Logan Bill will die if it is not acted upon by the Senate before adjournment.

But some members of the Senate seem to have realized, at last, the danger—the immediate danger—of the Frankenstein's monster they have set in motion. The very strategy the bureaucrats have employed seems to have given these members of Congress the jolt they needed. For, after they let themselves be twice put off by the request that they wait for the Attorney General's committee report, they awakened to the fact that they had simply been induced to surrender more of their legislative power to the executive branch of government.

The purpose of Congress is to consider legislation on its own account and through its own expert services. When Congress runs to an administrative agency for advice as to how to extricate itself from a mess it created in giving administrative agencies too much power, and when Congress permits itself to be hog-tied by such an administrative agency, it is destroying the primary reason for its existence.

It would do Congress, the bureaucrats and the public no harm to ponder what Winston Churchill said last week when a new session of Parliament was inaugurated. We proclaim, he said, "the faith and sincerity of our resolve to keep vital and active, even in the midst of our struggle for life, even under the fire of the enemy, those parliamentary institutions which have served us so well and which the wisdom and civic virtue of our forebears shaped and founded..." If, in a supreme emergency, the Prime Minister can say that, we, in our relatively protected situation, do little credit to ourselves if we permit the surrender of the prerogatives of our supreme legislative body.

Grant that there are imperfections in the Walter-Logan Bill. But remember that there was no such real or pretended strain for perfectionism when Congress was engaged in regulating business agencies. Bills were passed in fewer days than the Walter-Logan Bill has taken in months. Business was told that some inequities were inevitable in general legislation. Now the shoe is on the other foot. The regulators are to be regulated and apparently they can't take the medicine they so gaily dished up for others.


**Unionism Without Unity**

On the day the American Federation of Labor opened its New Orleans convention and received President Roosevelt's letter on labor peace and cooperation, AFL union plumbers on the Pittsburgh Housing Authority's Terrace Village project went on strike against AFL Heavy Construction Laborers Union members' laying the water mains.

Jurisdictional fights of this sort are older than the schism between the AFL and the Congress of Industrial Organizations. Every change or improvement in construction methods brings its series of them. Every large job must contend with one or more of them. Committees, conferences, authorities, referees, arbitrations, boards have been set up. Still these disputes go on.

The AFL itself can do nothing to prevent them. Its executive council told the convention, in discussing racketeering in unions, that the national and international unions the AFL has chartered are "autonomous organizations, exercising full and complete authority over their own administrative policies." What it cannot do with racketeers, it cannot do to prevent jurisdictional fights. So genuine unity in labor apparently requires, among other things, the reorganization of the AFL itself.

Many people, including Secretary of Labor Perkins, would like to see the American labor movement united at the top, joined formally at least. If we could assume, cynically, that there was no longer dispute on whether labor should organize by crafts or by industries, we could indeed tie the AFL and CIO together at the top, like a couple of bunches of radishes. This would yield certain political advantages. It would further the desire of some New Dealers for a national labor party proportionately as large as the present New York American Labor party—large enough to carry the balance in some national elections. But even the political effectiveness of such a union would be temporary. Unless the basic economic differences were settled it would fly apart.

The course of the two labor conventions suggests that real unity is a long way off. This is disappointing. But it is better to deal with the fundamental problems of reasons for disunion than to waste time concocting a papier-mâché union.
