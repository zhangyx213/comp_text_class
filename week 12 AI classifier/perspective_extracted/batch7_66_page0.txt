**What Liberties Are We Losing?–V**
by RAYMOND MOLEY

IN CONCLUDING this series, let us first
look back over our four preceding
articles and bring the various aspects
of the current Fair Deal program into
perspective—to see it clearly and to
see it whole. Then let us appraise
the present and ultimate effect of
such a vast expansion of government
planning upon significant aspects
of our national life and all the individual
lives which it encloses.

The immense paw of the
tax collector is already
upon us. He takes at least
$60,000,000,000 annually
now. As Herbert Hoover
pointed out last week, this
means at least 60 per cent
of our possible savings, after
we have paid for a reasonable
standard of living. But
the President and his party
ask for more. Senator McClellan, a
Democrat, tells us that the President’s
program calls for an additional
$20,000,000,000 to $25,000,000,000.
That would increase the bite from our
savings to a possible 80 per cent. That
means that the individual’s freedom
to invest or otherwise dispose of his
surplus earnings is approaching the
vanishing point.

Meanwhile, our past savings, laid
aside in years when taxes were not so
oppressive—contemptuously referred
to by the President as years of darkness,
denial, and despair—are shrinking
in real value under inflation. For
government’s needs are not met by
taking from what we earn this year. A
larger and larger amount is taken from
what we have earned and saved in
past years. A deficit reaches a long
arm back and grabs what government
failed years ago to take in taxes. Thus,
government forecloses the future,
robs the present, and sacks the past.

GOVERNMENT must, in putting over
its program, knock down or chisel
away the constitutional right of an individual
to the property he has created
or earned. This, as we have seen,
is done by making property a third-
class right or by substituting for it the
idea of security through government.
Thus, our serene highness, government,
takes what you have and hands
you a vague promise that has no binding
force on future holders of power.
The alleged benefits bought by our
money consist of a long list of government
activities, each of which shears
away some of our liberties. The doctor
and his patients are to be ruled by a
ministry of health. The farmer is controlled
by a Brannan. The worker is
delivered over to a Reuther, a Lewis,
or a Green. The businessman is in
hock to the RFC. The old folks are
on a dole. The people are to get light
and power from autocratic
valley authorities, for whatever
prices their masters
choose to charge. Even the
water on the farm is to be
spoon-fed by a bureaucrat.

The prospect is enchanting. A tight
little life with everybody equal. Hordes
of officials peering into every
corner of our lives. A barren
plain of uniformity, over
which ride the inspectors and police of
a superstate. A fine end for a nation of
once self-respecting pioneers! As
Churchill once exclaimed in another
connection: “What kind of people do
they think we are?”

In 1947 Prime Minister Attlee admitted
that seventeen ministries had
the power to enter private houses
without search warrants. That is the
ultimate picture of a planned state.

BUT, says the planner, you still have
freedom of thought and expression.
Let us see. As freedom of choice
ceases in the use of earnings, in occupation,
in the things bought and sold,
in caring for ourselves and our dependents,
our minds lose the habits of
freedom. The superstate hires a
greater and greater number of us, and
we learn that it is best to keep our
mouths shut and our opinions to ourselves.
The businessman whose customer
is the government must realize
that the customer is always right. Our
private cultural, educational, and religious
institutions, denied contributions
from vanishing private savings, become
government dependents.

In the end, there must be very little
left for free expression and thought.
Somebody else does all the thinking
about everything important in life.
Moral and intellectual atrophy sets in,
and self-reliance evaporates in the
thin air of absolutism.

The planning of things ends in the
planning of men.
