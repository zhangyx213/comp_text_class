**A Great Dissent**

by Raymond Moley

Those liberals who have so enthusiastically hailed the majority opinion of the Supreme Court in the state-districting case fail to realize that Justice Holmes, whose memory they so devoutly revere, would have agreed with Justice Frankfurter's vigorous and eloquent dissent. For many of the most famous Holmes dissents held that the states should be permitted to make their decisions, possibly make mistakes and rue them and correct them, rather than make them children of the Court.

It is not the relentless accumulation of years—80 in November—that has changed Frankfurter, the firebrand of four decades ago, to the most conservative Justice on the Court. It is the march of events and policies. A lot of us believe that those events and policies have been marching in the wrong direction.

It is not a popular matter to seem to defend the inaction of the states in redistricting. But there are those who place principle over popularity. In this instance neither Frankfurter nor this writer is raising the question of the wisdom of the present status of representative government. Rather, the Frankfurter dissent denies the right of the Court to inject itself into a political matter; denies the stupid assumption, even if there is a right, that the courts are capable of making the mathematical calculations and the cartography essential to redistricting, and, finally, denies the assumption, so generally held, that a representative government is also a democracy.

**'WITHOUT GUIDELINES'**

The Frankfurter dissent deserves careful reading and reflection. For it is not only wise, it is a splendid piece of judicial prose.

The majority opinion, Frankfurter holds, is a "massive repudiation of the experience of our whole past ... disregard of inherent limits in the effective exercise of the Court's 'judicial power.'" A task has been imposed upon judges and courts "without guidelines for formulating specific, definite, wholly unprecedented remedies for the inevitable litigations that today's umbrageous disposition is bound to stimulate..." The courts, Frankfurter suggests, are plunged into a "mathematical quagmire." The decision of the majority invites "legislatures to play ducks and drakes with the judiciary." Judges selected, presumably, because of their knowledge of law, past and present, should not play with state politicians at the game of people, maps, and pencils. That is a game at which those politicians have become expert over the generations. The weapons are those of the politicians. The terrain is where they were born and raised. In the scuffle that must ensue, clay feet may emerge beneath the robes of many a judicial idol.

**NOT A DEMOCRACY**

It is implied in the Court's decision and in the President's statement in his press conference that the mere lifting of a judicial finger will awe the politicians involved. This is absurd and naïve. A command without the means of enforcement will mock the authority which utters it.

But there is also an assertion which involves a principle basic in the American system. That is that this is a democracy rather than a republic. Indeed, every sort of prudent device was incorporated in the Constitution to prevent such a degeneration. Of all people, Supreme Court Judges should know that. For one of them in a majority of five may overturn the will of the majority expressed in the laws of Congress, of 50 legislatures, and thousands of local legislative bodies.

While the majority inserted a few words suggesting that geographical consideration should be weighed along with population in the selection of representatives, the clear implication is that population should be paramount. This concept has never been generally practiced: "It was not the English system, it was not the colonial system, it was not the system chosen for the national government by the Constitution ... It is not predominantly practiced by the states today." True representation involves interests as well as majorities. And a sparsely settled county, as well as our smaller states, can have a voice in the government only through representation. Only in that manner can we escape the ruthlessness of an overriding majority.
