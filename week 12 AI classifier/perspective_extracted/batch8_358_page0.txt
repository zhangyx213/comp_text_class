**TODAY IN AMERICA**

**RANDOM NOTES ON LABOR**

THE American labor movement is short of leaders. That has always been its major handicap and, at this juncture, may prove to be its tragedy. John Lewis, let us grant, is an able general. Let us further assume that he has a fairly good general staff at headquarters. But, to pursue the military simile, he has suddenly occupied a wide front while he lacks regimental officers. His handful of men at headquarters cannot spread themselves to cover the steel, rubber, glass and automobile sectors simultaneously. And the only line officers available are those with some experience in the mine fields, or with inadequate training in the old A.F. of L. craft unions.

AN ACUTE observer of our labor situation suggests that one reason the British labor movement has good leadership is that it affords almost the only career open to able workmen. In this country, the men who show a gift for leadership are apt to be picked out for promotion and put on the road to managerial responsibility. More than 90 per cent of our steel executives started in the ranks. How many of them might have been fine labor leaders if there had been no other avenue for advancement?

IN CLEVELAND the other day, an employer was describing with passion and bitterness the ingenuity with which a self-appointed leader of the men in his shop was winning point after point.  "But," he concluded, "it's mostly my fault. He should have been made a foreman a year ago."

LEADERSHIP in the railroad unions is distinctly superior, which perhaps helps make the point that experience and opportunity develop such men. Railroad executives are devoutly thankful that their labor relations were put on a solid basis long ago. Many a railroad president will state candidly that men the unions send to negotiate with him talk across the table as his peers in intellect and character.

OPEN OR CLOSED shop? For eight hours, I am told, the Chrysler management and the union leaders tried to draft a compromise on the question. Of course the negotiators knew when they started that, by definition, a shop is closed or it isn't, but both sides made a perfectly sincere effort to find a way out of the impasse. Something like 150 penciled memoranda were drawn up during the day. Not one of them furnished a basis for agreement.

THE NEWEST variation of the sit-down—and even more difficult to meet—is the "slow-down." Workmen simply slacken the pace of operations. They can, by concerted effort, put the factory into a hopeless snarl within half an hour. What to do? They are not trespassers, illegally occupying property. They are working—not so fast as they should, or could, but still working. Fire them? That might be construed as a lockout. The slow-down has been used in several plants in the Middle West and nobody has licked it yet, save by adjusting the grievance, whatever it may be.


IN WISE contrast to some of the other manufacturers, the steel industry has raised its prices as little as possible. There is good reason to believe it has not even covered its increased costs. From semi-official sources in Washington the word has leaked out that the steelmen are "profiteering"—that steel quotations have been increased much more than is warranted by the increase in steel labor costs. These hasty critics, however, overlooked the rise in other costs. Scrap is sky-high, and purchased scrap supplies about 25 per cent of the raw material for every ton of steel. Great Lakes boats have served notice that ore freight rates will be increased an average of 14 per cent when the navigation season opens. Manganese, copper, chemicals, and alloy materials in general have gone up sharply in price. Sincerely afraid that sharp price increases would curtail consumption, the steelmen set prices that represent a shorter profit per ton than they have enjoyed during the first quarter of the year.

HAVING SHOWN restraint in quoting new prices themselves, steelmen are severely critical of some of the things they see going on. A manufacturer of some more or less important gadget made of steel grants his employees, let us say, a 10 per cent increase in wages. Then he finds that the price of steel has gone up 10 per cent. Whereupon he increases the price of his product 20 per cent. Analyze this: the direct labor cost of his product amounts to 15 per cent of the selling price of his product. That, by the way, is a fairly typical figure in a great many important industries. Raw material cost is 25 per cent. Well, 10 per cent of 15 per cent is only 1 1/2 per cent and 10 per cent of 25 per cent is only 2 1/2 per cent. The manufacturer's costs in other words have gone up 4 per cent—but he tacks on 20 per cent. That is the sure way to dry up markets and insure the early recurrence of depression.

STEELWORKERS have had a disillusioning experience: Landlords in the steel towns immediately raised rents, prices went up in stores and, within no time at all, the local cost of living completely overtook the new wages.

TWO FALLACIES tend to confuse us all on the price-wage situation. The first is the workman's delusion that higher wages in money necessarily leave him any better off. When prices are raised to cover his new wages, he frequently finds himself worse off. The other fallacy, even more widespread, is the notion that higher wages for industrial workmen necessarily make for prosperity. They don't—if prices rise as fast or faster, for the simple reason that industrial wage earners are a much smaller proportion of the market for consumers' goods in this country than is commonly supposed. Farmers, employees in the great business of distributing goods and millions of service employees are also consumers. Any one of these three classes is as important, consumer-wise, as the factory workers who are winning spectacular wage increases now. And one of the causes of the last crack-up was the fact that industrial wages and, consequently, the prices of things industrial workers made, got too far out of line with the incomes of the rest of the population.
