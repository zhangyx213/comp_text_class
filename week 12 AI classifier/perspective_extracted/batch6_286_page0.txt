This Is No Budget
by Raymond Moley

FROM time to time over the past
five years I have suggested in this
space that the President's yearly esti-
mates of revenue have been too low.
These suggestions, moreover, were
made before, not after the proof came
in. And invariably the proof sustained
my statements. In estimating Fiscal
1947 the President missed the mark
by more than $8,000,000,000. For
1952 he already admits
an error of $7,580,000,000.
These gross underestimates
may have been due to his
failure to consider that
when inflation and increased
business activity are going
on, tax receipts rise at a
higher rate than national in-
come. But since his advisers
must have learned this sim-
ple fact after two or three
egregious blunders, the reason may
reflect less credit on the President.
He may have made those underesti-
mates to buttress his demands for
higher tax rates.
Now he estimates receipts for Fiscal
1953 at $70,900,000,000, which is
$15,800,000,000 higher than he esti-
mated in 1951 for Fiscal 1952 and
$8,600,000,000 higher than he ex-
pects to get in Fiscal 1952.
Since he got tax increases from Con-
gress estimated to swell revenues only
$5,000,000,000 to $6,000,000,000, it
is clear that he is at long last taking
account of inflationary factors.
But he has changed his tune too
late. For I shall venture the guess that
he will get, at present tax rates, much
less in Fiscal 1953 than his estimate.
For a lot of new factors have appeared
that promise lower tax returns.
To begin with, this Truman esti-
mate ignores the immensely increased
squeeze on profits. Corporations almost
generally expect sharp cuts in profits.
Price ceilings, a cut in civilian produc-
tion, and higher tax rates will take-in
fact are taking-their toll. Wage in-
creases forced upon companies with
the approval of the Federal govern-
ment will cut profits still more. U.S.
Steel reports that an 18Â½ cent wage
increase will cost the government
$525,000,000 in revenues.
The big bulge in corporate profits
after Korea was not in big companies
but in small ones. Now the smalls are
moving into less favorable figures. It is
the bigs that will do best from now on.
Also, war production is less profit-
able than civilian production because
of regulations, price-fixing, and re-
negotiation. From which follows the
conclusion that cutbacks in civilian
production will be cutbacks in profits.
Two factors may well reduce reve-
nues from taxes on personal incomes.
One is the fact that rates are now so
high that we have probably
passed the point of dimin-
ishing returns. Taxpayers
will not only search out
every possible deduction
but be less and less inclined
to "work for Uncle Sam."
Those with fewer scruples
will themselves, after read-
ing stories of how big crooks
have fixed the government,
cheat more and more.
So we shall probably have less rev-
enue in Fiscal 1953 than the estimate
-perhaps several billions less. But
that will probably not mean a larger
deficit, because the extravagant fig-
ures of military expenditures will not
materialize. No one with any knowl-
edge of the facts believes that the
government can possibly spend what
it is asking for this year or next. So
much has already been appropriated
and remained unspent that, accord-
ing to the Director of the Budget, on
June 30 there will be $72,800,000,000
unspent from what was already
appropriated and available when Con-
gress adjourned last year. This
tremendous piling up of unspent ap-
propriations is wholly out of control.
Barron's estimates that the govern-
ment will have $178,000,000,000 for
arms through June 30, 1953.

THESE astronomical sums, running on
and on from year to year, with
fantastically erroneous estimates of re-
ceipts make a mockery of the true
meaning of a budget. For when the
executive budget was created, it was
to be a yearly plan, a means of control
by the Executive and Congress, and a
method of letting the public know
what was happening to its money.
These objectives are lost. We are
coasting down a fiscal hill, in the
dark, with no brakes, and with a
slap-happy Executive at the wheel.
To use a recent Truman word, this
budget is just "eyewash."
