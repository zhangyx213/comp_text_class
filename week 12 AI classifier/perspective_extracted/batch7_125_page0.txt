**Fair Deal Under the Sea**

by RAYMOND MOLEY

BEAUMONT, TEXAS—If there are no
further delays, the Supreme Court
of the United States will soon hear
arguments on a petition by Attorney
General Tom Clark to bring suits
against Texas and Louisiana to establish paramount Federal rights in the
submerged lands under the Gulf of
Mexico and adjacent to those states.
This long-controverted subject is consequently of lively interest in
the two states concerned, as
well as in a number of other
states where, potentially at
least, there are oil and mineral
wealth of incalculable
value under the shallow
waters along the seacoast.
Secretary Ickes raised this
issue in 1936 when he
claimed that rights in this
continental shelf belonged to
the national domain. Since then, all
sorts of embellishments have been
added to the original contention, including the vast importance of Federal
control in relation to national defense.
The states involved have resisted bitterly. They assert that if these lands
can be taken from them on such
grounds, there is nothing to protect
other, inland natural resources from
similar claims. The Federal government since the war has moved ahead,
and two years ago a suit similar to the
current one was brought against California. The court held that the Federal
government has a “paramount”
right in such waters off the coast of
California.


The President is vigorously promoting the effort, and a bill has recently
been introduced in Congress authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to
grant leases to private companies to
exploit the oil under the submerged
lands. Under these leases the government would get 12½ per cent royalty
on oil and gas production. It would
also permit the issuance of new leases
in exchange for those already granted
by the states. The bill does not determine how the government’s share
would be divided, but it is likely that
some such plan will be proposed as
was contained in a bill last year. In
that bill 37½ per cent of the government’s take would be given to the tide-
lands states from which the oil and gas
is taken, 52½ per cent to the seventeen
so-called “reclamation” states, and the
rest to the Federal Treasury.
On the other hand, representatives
in Congress from the states affected
have introduced bills quitclaiming the
lands to the states. Such a bill passed
both houses two years ago but was
vetoed by the President. Last year a
bill passed the House but died in the
Senate. The present bill could probably pass but could hardly
overcome another veto. And
considering the opposition,
it is not likely that the Administration bill can pass.
If the Supreme Court further opens the way to Federal
title to these tidelands,
it will be overturning established law of long duration.
State ownership has been
upheld in more than 200
Federal and state court decisions. The
Federal government has consistently
recognized state ownership in buying
or leasing sites for lighthouses, jetties,
and other improvements along these
marginal waters. Texas, moreover, has
a claim which seems to transcend those
of all the other states involved. When
the Texas Republic was admitted to
the Union in 1845, it obtained from
the Congress of the United States
specific recognition of the new state’s
title to the land in question.
The oil companies, as is well known,
have been making extensive investments in tidewaters wells. In Texas
164 such wells have been drilled, and
more than $2,000,000 a year has gone
into Texas schools from the royalties
derived from them. In Louisiana
$29,000,000 has been added altogether
to state revenue from the proceeds of
oil leases in submerged areas.
The private companies have, since
the initiation of these tidelands proceedings, refrained from undertaking
further negotiations. They are afraid
to make the large investments required in the face of uncertainty about
the validity of their leases. They also
fear the ultimate effect of Federal control under leases obtained from the
Federal government.

It is hard to see how either the need
to conserve natural resources or the
demands of national defense justifies
this seizure of long-standing property
rights.
