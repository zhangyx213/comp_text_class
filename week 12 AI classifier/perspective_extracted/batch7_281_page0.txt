Report to the Russians
by RAYMOND MOLEY

This piece is not written to argue
or to interpret any of the territorial or
military issues between Soviet Russia
and her late allies. Nor is it directed
primarily to American readers. Its
purpose is, rather, to put into words
a picture of American opinion, di-
rected, as it were, to the eyes of re-
sponsible official Soviet Russia.
Official Russia will remember that,
while the formal recognition
of Russia by this country
was in November 1933, ac-
tual recognition was offered
in the spring, six months be-
fore, when President Roose-
velt included Soviet Russia
in an appeal to nations on
disarmament. The author of
this column was in an official
position then and partici-
pated in advising the Presi-
dent on that occasion. He
labored incessantly to get the new
President to reverse the policy of years
and to recognize Russia. In August
1941, when most "experts" predicted
the imminent fall of Russia, there was
written in this column the suggestion
that Hitler's crazy psychology and
Russian weather would bring dis-
aster to Germany. Over and over since
then, the aspirations of Russia for
security and legitimate influence have
been defended. All this is said to un-
derline the following observations.

A body of opinion is growing in
this country which is not favorable to
future American-Russian relations. We
may grant that some of the fuel for
this opinion is contributed by the un-
fair attacks of professional anti-Rus-
sians and by hostile newspapers. The
dismal continuity of these attacks
would not impair peaceful relations,
if there were no other factors.
Russia has weaknesses in relation to
this country which render it vulnerable
to psychological attack. There are
relatively few Americans of true Rus-
sian origin, while there are millions of
Poles, Germans and other voluble
enemies of Russia. A great religious
body is openly critical, for reasons
which we need not argue here. And
American Communism is a Russian,
not an American, liability.

What might be called American
capitalism is not inimical to Russia.
The leaders of American business are
as friendly to Russia as any other
group. And the vast middle-of-the-
road American people have no quarrel
with Russia. The great fight of Russia
for its existence won their keen ad-
miration.

But it is undeniable now that over
this country the air is becoming
charged with suspicion. The friends of
Russia of a year or two ago are turn-
ing away. It becomes harder and
harder for those disposed to friendly
relations to convince people. The great
hope for world peace is ebb-
ing. War is no longer re-
garded as impossible. This
is bad-very bad.

Another point which Rus-
sia should know: For better
or for worse, this country
will always ultimately de-
fend England. Those who
believed otherwise in 1914
and 1939 lived to learn. Let
us not argue the right or
wrong of this. It is a fact
which neither the Kaiser nor Hitler
nor many American pacifists realized.
Common origins, traditions, language,
plus the vast influence of Britain on
our thinking, are decisive. This is so
even while we decry British imperial-
ism and deplore British methods.
Americans are a literal people. They
cannot adjust themselves to "cowboy"
diplomacy. When they hear threats,
they believe them. When large Rus-
sian claims are made, they make no
allowances for trading talk. God save
their innocence, but they think diplo-
mats mean what they say! And they
suspect, above all else, that Russia in-
tends a world revolution and to press
on and on in quest of imperialism.
In November 1933, in the magazine
Today, I wrote, in an open letter to
Mr. Litvinoff, the new Ambassador:
"It isn't going to do any good to
attempt the methods of a decadent
European diplomacy. If, as we want
to believe, your government represents
something new in Europe, let it be
new in the sense that its diplomacy is
not of a pattern with the shopworn
melodrama of Talleyrand and Clemen-
ceau."

The United States and Russia are
still relative newcomers in world poli-
tics. Let us both reveal something
new. Let us be frank, reasonable and
temperate.

We Americans who believe that
two economic systems can live in the
same world will do our share. But the
Soviet must give us something with
which to work.
