Is This Food Necessary? II
by Raymond Moley

IN THIS space last week I pointed out
the fallacy in the argument that
new and vast Federal spending to
irrigate arid Western land is neces-
sary because of a prospective food
shortage in the foreseeable future. I
offered the incontrovertible testimony
of experts from the Department of Ag-
riculture that present developments in
the art of agriculture will provide all
that the nation will need up
to 1975 from the land al-
ready in cultivation. I
added the proviso that, if
by some miracle, the prod-
uct of existing acreage
should be insufficient to
feed and clothe the popula-
tion in that year, there are
millions of acres which can
be brought into cultivation
at vastly less cost than is
projected for reclaiming arid lands.
Since 1902, the irrigation of arid
lands in the seventeen reclamation
states has been a politically popular
enterprise. It has also been an exces-
sively costly one for the generality of
taxpayers of the nation.
In the 50 years up to 1952, the
Federal government had "reclaimed"
6,713,015 acres in those states, at a
construction cost of $2,174,633,749.
The farmers involved have repaid
only about 25 per cent of that sum.
For construction costs alone, the aver-
age per acre has obviously been much
more than the land is worth. A subsidy
involving interest-free repayment has
been in operation from the beginning.
The sum total of that charge on the
taxpayers of the nation is probably
several billion more.
We are now asked in such projects
as the Upper Colorado storage enter-
prise to spend at the rate of as much
as $2,700 an acre on land which, fully
irrigated, will be worth about a tenth
of that amount. And the Bureau of
Reclamation in 1952 had plans for
supplying water for 3,111,700 more
acres by 1959, at an average construc-
tion cost of more than $700 an acre.
This does not take into account the in-
terest subsidy which would run on the
unpaid costs far into the 21st century.
This paltry amount of reclaimed
land would be less than 1 per cent of
the 345 million acres of harvested
cropland in the United States.
According to the Department of
Agriculture, there are in the twelve
humid states from Virginia to Louisi-
ana 13,344,000 acres which could be
made available for crops at a drainage
and clearing cost of about $165 an
acre. And there are 7 million more
acres in other states.
We still have another way of in-
creasing our supply of food and fiber.
It has been abundantly demonstrated
in recent years that with
modest means of supple-
mental irrigation in humid
and semihumid areas in
such states as the Carolinas,
Georgia, Alabama, and Mis-
sissippi it is possible to
increase enormously what
is raised there. Senator
Eastland, in April 1954,
made a long and in-
tensely interesting speech in
the Senate describing the marvels
achieved in the South by such supple-
mental irrigation. He showed with
practical examples the relatively small
cost per acre of such methods and the
remarkable results that have been
achieved. In practice, he said, such
irrigation from nearby streams and
ponds pays for itself in from one to
four years.
Several farm journals have been
full of the news of this means of
stimulating production. One of the
most zealous exponents of this gospel
of self-help at small cost has been
W.B. Camp of Bakersfield, Calif.
Camp, a native of South Carolina, has
actually practiced what he has been
preaching in his home state. He noted
in California that cotton flourished on
irrigated land. He then applied what
he learned on his farms in South Caro-
lina and found that the secret of large
production was not in the soil but in
regularity of water supply. His ideas
have taken root in various colleges in
the South where training and research
are carried on.

IT MIGHT be well for the senators and
congressmen from those states, as
well as the taxpayers in all states, to
challenge the excessively expensive
demands of the arid states in this
and succeeding Congresses. The fu-
ture needs for food need not be
sought in the desert. They can be
supplied where food in the past has
amply sustained us.
