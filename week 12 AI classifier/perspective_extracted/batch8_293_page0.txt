**'Whipping the Devil'**

Despite rumblings of opposition, it seems likely that the President's spending program will be approved by Congress. Congress' newly born realization that the President is no longer unbeatable will probably result in its insistence upon controlling some of the expenditures. But credit inflation on a mild scale is clearly the road we are to travel for a while.

Looking down the road a piece, it is not difficult to foresee at least one characteristic of the outing—wholly aside from the possibility that it may end in a long and tortuous hike back: we can expect that the road maps the Administration’s vendors hand us from time to time will be pretty misleading.

These will be in the nature of figures and accounts broadcast from Washington in anticipation of the elections. It is true that figures do not lie. But if they are arrayed by accountants with sufficient ingenuity they can so baffle the lay outsider that it is impossible for him to discover what is the true flow of funds at any particular time. Certainly they can be meaningless as an indicator of whether our productive equipment is paying the cost of our government.

The presumption that we will be regaled with accounts like these is hardly unjustified in view of the fact that the Administration has already adopted a new kind of bookkeeping so far as speeches are concerned. As early as the autumn of 1936, political orators claimed that the Hoover deficit was not much smaller than the Roosevelt deficit—failing to mention, of course, that these astonishing figures were obtained by treating repayments on loans made by the RFC in the Hoover era as income in the Roosevelt era. Thus the Roosevelt budget was verbally brought nearer to balance out of Hoover deficits.

There is no reason to believe this kind of oratorical budget balancing will not continue so long as we can be told in fireside chats that "It is true that the national debt increased $16,000,000,000, but remember that in this increase must be included several billion dollars’ worth of assets which eventually will reduce that debt…" at the same time that repayments on government loans are being used as current income and are not being used to reduce the debt. Nor is there any reason to believe that the new bookkeeping theory will not continue so long as the young lawyers who write speeches and otherwise help to direct the careening


course of Federal policy these days drink deep at the well of economic enchantment that is David Cushman Coyle, adviser to various governmental divisions, boards, committees and Presidential assistants.

The outstanding characteristic of the new rhetorical order of bookkeeping which we must learn to expect in the months ahead is a vast confusion of terms. The government, we are told by Mr. Coyle in the April Harpers, should operate on the basis of a balance sheet similar to that of a business. Ignoring completely the fact that the government is not a business in respect to budget control, that it does not operate on a profit system but on a mutual system, Mr. Coyle proceeds to develop the fallacious analogy. "Like any merchant," says he, "the government has intangible assets" and chiefest among them is "the taxpaying ability of the citizens." Then Mr. Coyle indulges in some delightful, although unconscious, humor when he implies that this asset grows by what it feeds upon—that the more we borrow and spend, the better able we may be to collect money from the taxpayer. This "asset," however, we are to carry on the books at only a dollar value.

But aside from it, and presumably aside from such similar "assets" as the youth of the nation and the labor power of the nation, assets are to be credited against expenditures according to their "definite capital value." These assets he defines as, first, municipal bonds and private notes and mortgages "in proportion to their probable repayment. Next comes self-liquidating property owned by the Federal government, such as certain national forest areas, with proper allowances for increase and decrease in value. Third is necessary physical plant for the efficient carrying on of public business, such as a post office which actually saves in rental costs, also with proper allowance for depreciation. Last is the long list of intangibles, including soil conservation, aids to navigation, education, public health and scientific research, all of… value but not clearly measurable in dollars."

The government, says Mr. Coyle, ought to list as assets its expenditures for such purposes, in the light of its own judgment of their capital value, and balance the budget accordingly. As a matter of fact, if our budget were thus organized, it would not surprise Mr. Coyle at all to find that we are in the black at this very instant. And if the budget is balanced and a small increase in taxation will produce a surplus, we ought not to overlook the opportunity to acquire new assets—

such as expenditures for forestation work —even if we have to borrow to avail ourselves fully of "good openings" like these. The flaw in this exquisite logical process is that it wholly confuses moral, esthetic and material values in defining the term "asset." If you buy a meal or get a haircut, you cannot consider the expenditure an asset. You may look or feel better for the moment, but you have not permanently increased your resources in any respect. In fact, in a little while, when you have to stop by at the restaurant or the barbershop again, you are going to realize that such expenditures are operating expenses and not capital assets. Similarly, the government cannot list expenditures for battleships or new lighthouses as assets. Battleships serve the immediate purpose of defense, and lighthouses contribute to the safety of ships, but they do not increase the country's ability to pay the cost of national defense, salaries to public officials, relief and so on. In short, it is clear that the new bookkeeping confuses the nature of an asset with the noble purpose of an expenditure.

This is not to mention the blithe inaccuracy of the exponents of the new bookkeeping as to the present budget. Mr. Coyle says: "... in the 1938 budget there are two items called Investments and Acquisitions of Property that are probably more or less the same items that a corporation would put in its capital account. These items total $1,630,000,000." The fact is that these items are not expenditures but "obligations of appropriations" for the fiscal year 1938. But such gross misapprehensions as this are beside the point except in so far as they indicate the misleading quality of the argument for the new bookkeeping.

'Way back in December of 1932, Mr. Garner, who was then Speaker of the House, dryly described this form of bookkeeping as "whipping the devil around a stump." Had he cared to enlarge upon that statement, he might well have added that charging expenditures which are not true assets to capital account is merely designed to make us feel better about the deficit. It doesn't get rid of the deficit.

This is not to suggest that all expenditures can or should be paid out of current revenue. But it is to say that, if we drift into the belief that most of our governmental expenditures can be considered national assets, we shall soon believe that our assets are increasing so rapidly that if we printed all the currency we could use it could never exceed the security. Still, perhaps, there is no reason for us to feel alarm as we listen to glowing accounts of the schools, roads, bridges, parks and that host of other things that make us more valuable to ourselves. It is comforting to know that we could remain in the black, according to Mr. Coyle, up to the point of national disaster where money ceased to have any value at all.
