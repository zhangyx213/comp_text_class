**How to Behave Like a World Power**

**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

**8â€”Political Policies**

A world power whose international political policies are marked by drift and improvisation would not be a world power long. Russia and Britain have had fixed policies. Neither revolution nor war nor economic change has fundamentally altered them. The evidence of that is to be seen in their London demands. By contrast, the London Peace Conference has revealed only the faint dawn of American policy.

But one American move there may be the promise of sound future policy. It is this: Our position in Europe is more tentative, detached and conciliatory than it is in Asia. In Europe we seek nothing but good will and a reasonable assurance against another war. We are mediating or should mediate between Russian and British claims and between France and her rivals. We seek the permanent pacification of Germany and a Europe without war.

That position might well be the first principle of our long-term international policy in Europe and the Near East. Our stake in Europe, while large, is not a first consideration. We certainly should never be put in a position where we can be played off as a major rival of Russia, although British and French diplomacy will surely make that a major aim.

On the other hand, our position in the Pacific and Eastern Asia is decisive, constructive and permanent. Our forces actually won the war against Japan. We made no bones about assuming the leadership in her surrender. We are occupying Japan with our own troops operating under our own plans. We are reestablishing ourselves in the Philippines. We shall probably set up bases in the Pacific suitable for permanent domination of the sea, from China to the Western Hemisphere and from the Equator to the North Pole.

Our armed power and our political influence in that area are essential to our own continental safety and to the permanent stability of Eastern Asia. We have no territorial needs in Asia or in the Dutch East Indies or in Japan. But our influence must remain, if for no other reason than that there is no other center around which law and order can be built. Russia has made it clear that she wants nothing in China, beyond what she has acquired by her Chinese treaty. She has already claimed the Kuriles and the remainder of Sakhalin. Britain is hardly in a position to go beyond a restoration of her former position in Asia.

In that vast area, our policy should be the cementing of friendly and mutually beneficial arrangements with a restored and democratic Japan, with China and Korea, with the Dutch East Indies and with Australia and New Zealand.

The Dutch East Indies have great resources, which we can take in exchange for our own exports. That area was saved by our armed strength. Holland is a long way from her colonies and, no doubt, would welcome profitable trading relations between them and the United States.

Our relations with Australia and New Zealand, which will be governed by no man-made circumstances, might well set our pattern for our policy toward England and the British Empire. First, we cannot let the British Isles be conquered by a continental power. Two wars have proved that. Next, we do not guarantee the entire British Empire, but we shall have to protect those parts of it which touch our orbit of safety and interest. The two countries "down under," Canada and the British Atlantic and Pacific islands come under that head. This means no political union with them. But their economic and military destiny will move toward us under circumstances as sure as the law of gravitation.

Our Pan-American policy will continue to grow as it has in the past. Thus, American world policy will recognize its degrees of interest in accordance with our concern in three great world regions. In Europe and the Near East, it is defensive and mediatory; in Pan-America, it is defensive unity with our neighbors; in East Asia and the Pacific, it is broad, constructive and important beyond calculation.
