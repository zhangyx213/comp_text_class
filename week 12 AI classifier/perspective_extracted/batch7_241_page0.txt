**The Statesmanship of the NAM**

**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

It is hard to see what more the
National Association of Manufacturers
can do to win public recognition of
fairness. Perhaps if it should elect
Henry Wallace or John L. Lewis as
president, it might win over some
scoffers.

But the middle-of-the-road people of
the country who want management
and labor to get along somehow will
find in the 1946 attitude of
the NAM reason, justice and
moderation.

The NAM has come a
long way to reach this point
of view. Fifteen years ago,
its policies were tough, in-
dividualistic, definitely anti-
labor. Those who have
known of its inner workings
in the years since then know
how hard the exponents of
the old order have died. But
the old guard is all but gone now.

A clear indication of the new atti-
tude arose last week in a meeting of
the NAM board of directors. The issue
was whether the Wagner Act should
be repealed outright or revised. The
revisionists defeated the abolitionists
by an overwhelming majority. This
outcome was to have been expected,
in light of the increasingly moderate
attitude toward labor in past meetings
of the association.

The organization has had a series of
outspoken presidents, drawn not from
the great corporations of the country,
but generally from smaller or medium-
sized ones. NAM policy, as expounded
in its resolutions, its publicity and in
the speeches of its responsible officers,
has been vigorous in its resistance to
the growth of governmental power and
bureaucracy and urgent in its demand
for a better balance between labor and
management.

The association has also given
great attention to an educational pro-
gram to present the advantages of free
enterprise. The most notable feature of
this program is a new book, "The
American Individual Enterprise Sys-
tem," written by a group of economists
for the NAM, under the general direc-
tion of our former NEWSWEEK col-
league, Dr. Ralph Robey. It is a
monumental expression of the history,
philosophy and methods of that sys-
tem. This work is bound to have a pro-
found influence on economic thought
in this country, where so much of what
is published and taught in the eco-
nomic field is an attack on and a denial
of the system under which we operate.

A notable example of advanced
thinking in the NAM was Executive
Vice President Walter B. Weisenbur-
ger's reference to an annual wage. This
idea, hitherto regarded as impossible
by management, should, according to
Weisenburger, be something to con-
sider and it should "study every pos-
sible process of adding more
regularity to employment."
This is getting down to fun-
damentals.

The NAM labor program
recognizes that there are
two alternative courses in
dealing with the problem of
labor's present monopolistic
power. The first is to break
up the monopoly by apply-
ing the restraint-of-trade
curbs which now apply to
ownership and management. This
course would be somewhat difficult
to enforce. It would also be difficult to
sell to the public. And it would look
like reaction.

Another course, which might take
five years to accomplish, would be to
equalize bargaining power by a series
of legal steps. The first would be an
enforced open shop. The second, a
better legal means of enforcing con-
tracts. The third, a series of required
preliminaries to a strike. The fourth,
an outlawing of strikes which do not
affect wages, hours or working condi-
tions. The fifth, a revision of the Wag-
ner Act to include management in its
protective power. The sixth, a legal ex-
emption for management from bar-
gaining with foremen or other agencies
of management.

An angry Congress is likely to enact
a labor program which will be vastly
more severe than the alternatives out-
lined by the NAM. The issue before
the country now is whether labor and
management are going to get together
and agree on a program or whether
extreme anti-strike measures such as
Senators Byrd or Ball are advocating
will be passed.

The danger in another series of
disastrous strikes will be the ultimate
enactment of compulsory arbitration,
which both labor and management
want to avoid.

Labor everywhere can well con-
sider the mild NAM proposals as a
basis of constructive negotiation. Time
is running out.
