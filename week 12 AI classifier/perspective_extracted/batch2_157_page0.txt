**Nixon Versus Brown**

*by Raymond Moley*

LOS ANGELES—That the authority and responsibility of the states have been so largely submerged by the Federal government is a fact regretted by all believers in our constitutional system. But it is a fact which confronts every candidate for a governorship. In Pennsylvania Rep. William W. Scranton is stressing Cuba and other national issues in his contest for the governorship. Scarcely had Robert Morgenthau been selected to run against Governor Rockefeller than he hied himself to Washington to get help.

When I spent three weeks last spring here in California, Governor Brown’s main issue was that Nixon was interested only in national and international affairs and knew nothing about the state of California. To a considerable extent this taboo imposed by his opponent affected Richard Nixon’s campaigning. After the primary, several weeks were spent by both sides in preparing for the fall. Then as things rather mildly came to life in September, the voters remained apathetic. This indifference toward the discussion of state issues prevailed at the end of September.

The office of governor is not unimportant nor are the affairs of California inconsiderable. The annual budget of the state is close to $3 billion. Vast plans are under way for water use. An enormous educational system is directed from Sacramento. But the minds of the people were riveted on issues beyond the borders of the state.

**THE TABOO**

Another fact conditions the situation. Interest centers upon Nixon’s colorful personality. People are strongly for him or against him. Brown excites no one. His image is that of the plodding, unimaginative caretaker of state affairs. His personality and stewardship create neither enthusiasm nor condemnation.

And so having decided apparently that he must dissipate Democratic apathy, Brown shifted his plans and began to attack Nixon’s position on national affairs when he was Vice President and also when a candidate for President in 1960. This, it would seem, opens the way for Nixon to break the taboo and to permit him to counter with a discussion of national and international affairs.

Brown, like Morgenthau, made the pilgrimage to Washington to ask for help. New Frontiersmen have appeared in California, quietly at first but in considerable numbers. The President, having made one trip to California to extol the importance of water in the lives of men and plants, now promises to make a campaign visit over two days in late October.

**WORLDWIDE OUTLOOK**

On this trip I have had the opportunity to speak before audiences—in San Francisco, Sacramento, San Bernardino, San Diego, and Los Angeles. Such speeches provide an excellent way to judge public sentiment. I found sharp interest in such subjects as Cuba, Berlin, and the Far East. They were far more concerned about what Communist imperialism is doing around the world, and notably in the Caribbean, than about where their next source of water is located or whether there are pinks in state institutions.

As the nation’s most populous state they realize their vast stake in the United States and the world. They are aware that they pay more in income taxes than any state except New York. Their immense defense industries, their air and naval installations, and their long coastline bring home their part in the defense of the nation in the event of war. Almost every state activity is tied in with the Federal government and there are more Federal employees here than in any other state or the District of Columbia.

There is also to be considered the influx of a new population—2 million in four years. These newcomers come from the reaches of the nation and they are not informed about nor interested in California’s government.

All these circumstances will almost inevitably turn this Nixon-Brown contest into a lively and vital referendum of national and international policies. When the lines are thus drawn Nixon will be in his own field. For he has prepared for such a contest during his thirteen years in Washington. He is also a foremost leader in his party. Thus this campaign can become an exciting and memorable political event.
