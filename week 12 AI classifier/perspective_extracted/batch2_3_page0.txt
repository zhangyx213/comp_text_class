PERSPECTIVE

PROFITS FROM SUBSIDIES

BY RAYMOND MOLEY

When the recipients of government
handouts get rich enough to
start a lending bank it is time to
revise not only policies but the meaning
of words. Yet an amazing proposal
for such a bank has been made by
the National Rural Electric Cooperative
Association on the advice of a
venerable Wall Street investment
firm, Kuhn, Loeb and Co.

It seems that the great almoner,
Uncle Sam, has been so generous in
providing capital for some hundreds
of rural-electric cooperatives that they
have accumulated hefty cash surpluses.
Despite their lavish way of
putting money not only into electrical
operations but into businesses quite
unrelated to the purposes for which
they were formed, they have a lot of
money left over for investment.

The Rural Electrification Administration
was created in 1936 when
many farmers could not get electric
service. Now 98 per cent are served,
either from private companies or subsidized
co-ops. The total authorization
for loans to the hundreds of
co-ops has now reached $5.1 billion.
The money has kept flowing out at
2 per cent interest—$355 million in
1965 and $380 million for 1966.

BILLION-DOLLAR POOL

The trade association and lobby for
the co-ops is the National Rural Electric
Cooperative Association. This
organization has had under consideration
for some years the pooling of the
surpluses of the co-ops in a huge
lending institution, and with this in
mind the NRECA employed Kuhn,
Loeb to draw up a plan. The NRECA
has announced this plan:

First, the 2 per cent loans for 35
years should be retained for some
co-ops whose continuing need is
claimed.

Second, “a supplemental intermediate
loan program should be instituted
by REA which would provide 50-
year loans” at the current cost of
government borrowing—between 3
and 4 percent at today’s market.
“These loans should not be subject
to many of the restrictions now applying
to the use of REA loans.”

Third, private investment should
be brought into the program through
what is called a “Federal Bank
for Rural Electric Systems” or government-guaranteed loans, or both.
The directorship of the bank
should be composed of a representative
from each of the co-op regions
plus someone to represent the Department
of Agriculture. These would
be appointed by the President.

The bank should be financed by:
“1—Stock subscriptions by rural
electric borrowers, both voluntary
and through a requirement of a specified
purchase in relation to loans
obtained;

“2—Matching stock subscriptions
from the Federal government (Kuhn,
Loeb suggests an initial equity subscription
of $500 million);

“3—Borrowings by the bank in the
money markets, using equity stock
subscriptions by rural electrics and
the government subscription as a base
for debentures.”

This program would be administered
initially by the REA but the
ultimate purpose is to bring the operation
out of the government and
into the hands of the “borrower-
owned credit institutions.”

While the capital provided by the
co-ops would be close to half a billion
dollars, the Kuhn, Loeb people
propose that Congress authorize
“a Federal equity subscription of
$500 million.” Thus we would see a
billion-dollar institution in the money
market.

The American farmer has since the
days of Populism railed at Wall
Street. But now, with the help of a
Wall Street firm, the farmers would
join the “money-changers” with a big
institution of their own.

It should be noted that the plan
still would maintain the 2 per cent
handout for many of the co-ops. The
NRECA says that “the study data
demonstrate that a vast majority of
the systems cannot at this time get
along without this important program
if they are to reach the financial
strength and maturity necessary to
achieve the objectives of the rural-
electrification program.” These “objectives”
are well settled in the minds
of the people who propose this plan.
In essence they mean the establishment
of an immense and possibly
monopolistic power system subsidized
by government and subject to few of
the tax burdens borne by private
companies.
