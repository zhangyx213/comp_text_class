**The Danger and the Remedy**
by Raymond Moley

THE issue raised by the Bricker resolution and its various substitutes is not a mere lawyers' quibble. It deeply affects laymen everywhere and should be resolved by lay opinion over the nation. Most of the legal argument is irrelevant for three reasons: (a) no one can tell what this Supreme Court will say about detailed language; (b) practically all the judicial opinions on the effect of treaties and international agreements have been swept aside by the Missouri vs. Holland case in 1920 and the so-called Pink case in 1942; and (c) the vast machinery of legislation by international agreements that has come with the U.N. and other international bodies has exposed the social, economic, and political interests of every American citizen to new and strange legal restraints imposed not by the representatives of the people in Congress but in fact by bureaucrats unknown to the public.

The Holland case arose because a statute of Congress giving the Federal government authority to protect migratory birds had been declared unconstitutional. When that happened John W. Davis was Solicitor General. I shall let him state what happened in words used before the New York Bar Association in 1953:  "I took it upon myself...to march over to the Department of State and say to them—I think it was to Secretary Lansing in person—that if he would negotiate a treaty with Canada providing for the protection of these migratory animals which neither country was able to protect alone, and if under that treaty Congress should be empowered to pass a statute for their protection, I thought it would stand up, and it was so done.” In that way the Constitution was breached by a treaty. The same John W. Davis is now head of the leading pressure group fighting the amendment.

In the Pink case the Supreme Court decided that an executive agreement between F.D.R. and Litvinoff in 1933 was the supreme law of the land and superseded the Fifth Amendment and the law of New York.

In three preceding articles I have shown how, through international commissions, agreements are made which have controlled and can in the future control economic affairs within the country. A series of such agreements dealing with tin and other raw materials is in the works or is planned. There are pending in the U.N. international conventions such as the "human rights" contraption which could take the form of treaties or agreements binding upon the internal affairs of the country. President Truman's Committee on Civil Rights, whose report in 1947 he heartily endorsed, cited Missouri vs. Holland as authority for the statement that civil-rights legislation could be enacted despite constitutional barriers through an "international bill of rights."

Gen. Lucius D. Clay, also a member of the Davis group, in the first chapter of his book, "Decision in Germany," makes the best of all cases for control in his account of the disastrous agreements that led up to the Berlin isolation and all the trouble since. It was an agreement that isolated Berlin. Even Potsdam was an agreement.

Two points embodied in almost all of the proposed amendments would provide the protection needed. There would be clear statements in an amendment that "a treaty or other international agreement which conflicts with this Constitution shall not be of any force or effect" and "a treaty or other international agreement shall become effective as internal law... only through legislation by Congress." With these solidly in the Constitution, Congress can set up machinery to control and regulate international agreements.

THE President and Secretary of State assure us that as long as they are in power there is no danger. But surely the President can see that there is not only a potential danger in the future but that it is reasonable for people to demand constitutional protection against such danger. That demand will not die with some cleverly contrived parliamentary trick that shelves this issue during this session. It will persist until there is firm assurance for the long future ahead.
