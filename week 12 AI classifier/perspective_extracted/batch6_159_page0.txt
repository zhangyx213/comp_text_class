Shadow of Things to Come
by Raymond Moley

IN THE course of a reading of the
many, many pages of the TVA vs.
Middle South-Southern phase of the
Senate debate on the atomic-energy
bill, a question presented itself to
which the answer was immediately
obvious. Those men who screamed
their opposition hour after hour were
not the breed to strain at a $100 million
gnat. They had never dissented
while $1.78 billion was
poured into the TVA with
only an 8 per cent return to
the Treasury. They were
not really concerned about
a relatively small amount
of electric power to be sold
by private companies and
the denial of that slight
means of expanding the
immense TVA empire.

The very frivolity of their
quibbling demanded the cover of violent
language. The contract was a
"giveaway," a "sellout," a "terrible
calamity," a form of "monopolistic
bondage." The President was, according
to them, a tool of the power trust
and a malignant foe of the TVA. Not
even the consecrated estate to which
radicalism has elevated the TVA
could justify such passion.

No, we were witnessing a full-dress
rehearsal of the coming political campaign.
For as other issues such as an
Eisenhower depression or a slip in
foreign policy have disintegrated, and
the "house divided against itself" has
failed to fall, there remains for partisanship
only the "power trust." It is an
antique, rusty weapon, but it makes a
deafening noise. Partisans such as
Humphrey, Lehman, Gore, Kerr, and
the crafty Kefauver see at stake the
immense prize of a return to power.
Morse sees the gratification of vengeance
for which he has lusted ever
since Candidate Eisenhower made
common cause with Taft.

It was inevitable after the preliminary
skirmish over the electric-power
contract that the struggle would move
on to the infinitely more portentous
question of how atomic energy might
by a partnership between government
and individual enterprise serve
the civil needs of the American people.
If the opposition's concern had
been genuine, it would have been
quieted by the illuminating and judicious
speech of Senator Pastore. This

Democrat, who by no means is an
enemy of government enterprise, told
them that the bill was the result of
the joint committee's long and patient
study over a series of 70 meetings,
that it does not prejudge the issue of
public vs. private power, that years
will pass before the civil uses of
atomic energy will be realized, and
that the writing into the bill of preferences
would be innocuous.

But violent partisanship
and the determination to
discredit the President's
considered plans presumed
to choose the perilous
course of prejudgment and
to seek by legislative fiat
the exclusion of individual
enterprise from partnership
in the use of an agency for
human service in which in-
dividual enterprise shared the labors
of discovery and development. This
would open the way for the imposition
of the deadening hand of government
monopoly, which would in time
annihilate economic freedom. For this
concentrated form of energy may
dominate all forms of industrial life.
It will be well to think of that
when we hear the call of the demagogues
this autumn in the highways
and byways of the republic. The
senators, who were measurably limited
in this debate by parliamentary
rules and decorum, will then
be unrestrained.

It is fortunate that as the country
faces these momentous issues we
have a President who believes in
economic enterprise and local self-
government, and that on such fundamentals
as this his party is more
united than the opposition. It will
be well, too, as the members of the
House of Representatives come up
for the judgment of the electorate, to
note that the lower house has in this,
as in most cases, been a stable and
conservative force.

The left-wing Democrats are clearly
irreconcilable. Therefore, the President
and his party in the coming
campaign should stand squarely in
economic issues for partnership between
regulated individual enterprise
and government, at the local level
where possible. This is the only alternative
to Federal monopoly.
