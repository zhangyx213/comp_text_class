**CORPORATE GIVINGâ€”II**

**BY RAYMOND MOLEY**

While there are occasional objections by stockholders, most large corporations regard corporate giving for philanthropic purposes as an established practice. The practice had its origins long ago, but since World War II it has grown to large proportions. Since such outlays vary in size from company to company, and since it is difficult to define them, the total amount in dollars can only be estimated. But corporate philanthropy is now, no doubt, in excess of $1 billion and is rising every year.

The legality of these outlays is well established. The key case was decided in 1953 (P.A. Smith Manufacturing Co. v. Barlow, et al. 26 N.J. Sup. Ct. 106). Since the New Jersey Supreme Court enjoys high regard, this has been the guide in other states. Since 1945 a majority of states (38 in a recent report) have enacted permissive statutes. And the Internal Revenue Service has permitted deductions from profits of up to 5 per cent before taxes. The IRS has placed the aggregate of such deductions at between 1 and 2 per cent, although some small companies run as high as 5 per cent.

**THE SMITH CASE**

In the Smith case the court substantially abolished the old common-law test that corporate gifts must be of "direct benefit" to the company. This case involved grants to Princeton University for purposes quite unrelated to the commercial interests of the company. The dicta in the court's opinion are especially revealing: "There is now widespread belief throughout the country that free and vigorous non-governmental institutions of learning are vital to our democracy and the system of free enterprise and that the withdrawal of corporate authority to make such contributions within reasonable limits would seriously threaten their continuance. Corporations have come to recognize this and with their enlightenment have sought... to insure and strengthen the society which gives them existence."

Acting under this permission and under the general concept of responsibility stated by the New Jersey Court, many or most corporations have created administrative machinery to select grantees. A growing practice is to create a company foundation with personnel specialized in philanthropic work.

In no case have I discovered that a management has abandoned the concept that the major purpose of a company is to produce goods and services at a profit to the shareholding owners. This is as it should be. For without a margin from profits, there could be no philanthropy.

**SEVERAL INTERPRETATIONS**

The rationales for corporate giving vary in quality. Some still look to immediate gains such as creating a better "image" for the company. I cannot blame management for this argument, because there are many stockholders who could not be moved by more fundamental reasons.

Another stated reason is that contributions to educational institutions help to train people as prospective employees. But such outlays made with "public relations" and job training in view are not philanthropy at all. They are essential parts of a company's business.

I don't like such vague expressions as calling these philanthropic grants good "investments." That is an incorrect use of the term. An investment is something that is expected to produce a pecuniary return.

Also among the reasons why a company makes grants is that it must yield to coercion. The city fathers in a place where a company does business frequently "put the arm" on management with an implied threat of discrimination or harassment if it does not give. In such instances it is sometimes easier to yield than refuse, even when the purpose may not seem worthy to the management.

On a broader scale there is the important consideration that in a free society there should be a balance between "public" (or governmental) and "private" responsibility for meeting the infinitely varied needs of modern society. To permit government to carry all the burden is to assume the omniscience of a bureaucracy. And the price paid is individual freedom.

But there is an even greater and more basic rationale for corporate giving which I shall consider next.
