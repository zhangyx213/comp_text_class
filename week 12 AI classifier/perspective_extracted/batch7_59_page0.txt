**Academic Nonsense**

by RAYMOND MOLEY

SANTA BARBARAâ€”The regents, alumni, and faculty of the great University of California are shaken and divided by an issue that might have been avoided if a little common sense could have been mingled with the learning of a handful of teachers in that institution. The real issue is not, as has erroneously been stated, any "loyalty oath" set up by a hysterical and politically minded state government. It is whether all members of a faculty shall be governed by a simple statement requested by an overwhelming majority of the faculty itself.

The University of California, like other institutions, has been troubled for a long time by a tiny minority of alleged educators who have used the shield of academic privilege, prestige, and occupational security to protect their purpose of propagating ideas that are the deadly enemies of all freedom. Ultimately, a loyalty oath was established. A violent controversy ensued and finally, four months ago, the faculty of the university voted in favor of excluding Communists, on the ground that they were incapable of objective teaching. At the same time, the faculty requested the regents to abolish the so-called loyalty oath and to substitute therefor a non-Communist statement in each individual contract. This action had the support of 90 per cent of the faculty.

The regents the following month abolished the loyalty oath and, in cooperation with an alumni committee, worked out a non-Communist formula to be signed by faculty members. Ninety-eight and one-half per cent of the faculty complied in signing. One hundred fifty-seven refused.

IN JUNE, on the motion of Robert Sproul, president of the university, the regents unanimously voted to expel these recalcitrants. Then there followed a lot of arguing in which, it is said, even Governor Warren participated, and in July the regents by a vote of 10 to 9 decided to keep 39 of those who were earlier proscribed. Governor Warren voted with the majority. This has all the appearance of a face-saving action, in which it is not yet apparent whose faces will really be saved. It was rationalized by the fact that the 39 had appeared before a committee of the academic senate and said that they were not Communists. Thus, the academic mind by a process which would have done honor to the schoolmen of the Middle Ages finds a distinction in honor between the mouth and the pen.

The matter is not yet settled, for on Aug. 25 the regents will face a motion to reconsider the reconsideration.

The simple reason for a requirement in any free educational institution that those enjoying the privilege of academic freedom be loyal to our institutions is that no one can be a real beneficiary of the privilege of freedom if he is unwilling to abjure a belief that such freedom should be extinguished, which is of course the belief of Communism.

The contention that there is a distinction between believing, saying, signing, or swearing to such a disclaimer is a hazy film of unreality rising from befuddled and sterile speculation.

FOR more than 30 years I have held a university appointment, 27 of which have been at Columbia. In all those years I have freely taught, spoken, and written my opinions and findings of fact. I have participated actively and, I hope, effectively, in sometimes bitter political campaigns on all levels. Never has a word of criticism or a hint of pressure been offered. If, in the course of that time there had been required an oath of loyalty to the American system, I should have accepted it without a question. Such an oath, in fact, should be considered an honorable dedication to freedom.

A good many years ago, the President of the University of Minnesota tendered me a position. After concluding the arrangements he added: "My regents may ask me if you believe in the overthrow of American institutions by force or violence." It never occurred to me that to answer that in the negative was an impairment of freedom. After 30 years, it is still a mystery to me why anyone should object to an affirmation, in whatever form, that he believes in truth and freedom.
