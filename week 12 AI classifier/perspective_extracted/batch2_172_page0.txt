**PERSPECTIVE**

**California's New Mood**

*by Raymond Moley*

IN APPRAISING political opinion in a
state or region, the occasional visi-
tor has an advantage over those who
have lived there a long time. The
gradual change in the mood and char-
acter of the people is almost imper-
ceptible to the longtime resident. An
occasional check over a considerable
period provides a better perspective.

I hope I have such an advantage in
appraising the contest between Rich-
ard Nixon and Edmund G.P. Brown
for the governorship of California. For
I have spent from a few weeks to two
months a year in that state annually
over a period of 30 years. This year I
spent three weeks before and one
week after the primary in California.

In the 1930s the political life of the
state still followed the pattern of the
Hiram Johnson Progressivism. This
manifested itself in nonpartisanship
and in direct legislation. Radical
movements arose from time to time,
claimed national headlines, and after
a time were supplanted by new cru-
sades. The image thus created was
that of a state infested by eccentric
and irresponsible politics. The ex-
treme liberal governorship of Culbert
Olson from 1939 to 1943 marked the
culmination of that period. Earl War-
ren defeated Olson in 1942 and from
then until his elevation to the Su-
preme Court his major appeal was
based on the premise that he should
win Democratic votes by playing
down his Republican affiliation and by
liberal policies.

**POLITICAL TREND**

The growth of the state's popula-
tion from 1930 to 1940 was consid-
erable but not sensational. Such as
it was, migration came from more
impoverished states to the east. But a
great increase marked the decade of
the war-from 7 million to 10.5 million.
And from 1950 to 1960, more than
5 million were added. These later mi-
grants have been far more conserva-
tive than those who came earlier.
There were thousands of individuals
who were attracted to the advantages
of the state during military service.
There were also a great many farmers
from Texas and the Middle West who
found it possible to sell their land at
prices inflated by agricultural benefits.
And many new industries brought


large numbers of well-paid workers
and managers. The influx of Negroes
was relatively less than in New York,
Pennsylvania, and Illinois.

Thus, the political temper of Cali-
fornia's population has profoundly
changed. Republicans carried the
state for the national ticket in 1952
and 1956, for Knight for governor in
1954, Nixon for senator in 1950 along
with the re-election of Warren as gov-
ernor, and Kuchel for senator in 1954
and 1956. Knowland swept both sides
of the primary in 1952 with a majority
of 1,680,000. The Republican debacle
in 1958 was caused by a split in the
party and by the unpopularity of the
right-to-work amendment.

But the temper of the state remains
conservative. The Democratic advan-
tage in registration means very little
when the votes are cast in November.

**APPRAISAL OF PRIMARY**

On this background it is possible
to appraise the results of the recent
primary. The four Democratic can-
didates for governor polled about the
same number of votes as the three on
the Republican side. Republicans
voted 70 per cent of their registered
potential; the Democrats, 52 per cent
of theirs. Three unknown opponents of
Brown won 16.2 per cent of the Dem-
ocrats who voted. There were also an
indeterminate number of Democratic
write-in votes for Nixon and Joseph
Shell. Also, a number of state and local
bond issues were defeated.

The Republican vote split between
Nixon and Shell was in a ratio of al-
most exactly 2 to 1. Not more than
10 per cent of the Shell vote came
from Birchites and other extremists.
The remainder were merely regis-
tering moderately conservative opin-
ion. Shell has now loyally agreed to
support the ticket. I found no impor-
tant disposition among Shell voters not
to support Nixon in the campaign.

In fairness to California, I believe
it should be understood that while the
extremists there have made a lot of
noise, their political power is negligi-
ble. And the effort of Nixon in the
campaign should differ from that of
Warren in the 1940s. His appeal to
Democratic registrants should be to
the more conservative rather than the
more liberal among them.
