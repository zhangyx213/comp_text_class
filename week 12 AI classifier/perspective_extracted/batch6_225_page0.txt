**Leader and Party Builder**
by Raymond Moley

THE election of Surrogate Hall of
Nassau County, New York, sig-
nalizes a number of exceedingly im-
portant developments and conditions.
It marks the emergence of Presi-
dent Eisenhower as a skillful politician
in his own right, the appearance at
the head of the Republican organiza-
tion of a man who represents all fac-
tions in the party, and the emergence
on the national scene of the
most eminently qualified
Republican chairman in
many, many years.

When the resignation
of the ill-starred Wesley
Roberts was required, the
President moved vigorously
to get not only a much more
promising chairman, but a
man of his own choice; one
who would not only be
thoroughly acceptable to Senator Taft
and Speaker Martin but whom the
Dewey people would have to accept,
willy-nilly. Hall was not popular with
Governor Dewey or with Russell
Sprague, New York national commit-
teeman. But when the President
named his man, they had to comply,
the blow to the pride of those practical
politicians being softened, no doubt,
by the consolation of having the dis-
posal of Hall's job as surrogate.

Hall will do a great deal to unify
his party. He is an Easterner who in
the House was immensely popular
with the Midwesterners, whose voting
followed the line of the farm districts,
and who has shaken off all provin-
cialism in extensive travels, in the
United States and abroad.

By birth, residence, and sympathies
Hall belongs to the Republican, or
Oyster Bay Roosevelts. He held the
seat in the New York Assembly where
T.R. began his career. His given name,
selected by his parents in 1900, is that
of T.R.'s colonel and buddy, Leonard
Wood. Whoever knows Oyster Bay
realizes that it produces no city
slickers. It has none of the character
of metropolitan New York City. It is
a small, leisurely city of average folks,
deeply Republican and devoted to
the memory of T.R.

Consider, moreover, the extraordi-
nary range of Hall's experience in
politics: Republican town chairman,
state assemblyman, sheriff, surrogate,
congressman, major worker in four Presidential campaigns, and chairman
of the National Republican Congres-
sional Committee. Here is success at
every level in American political life.
He became chairman of the Re-
publican Congressional Committee in
1947 and immediately made that
hitherto moribund body a vital force
for helping in the campaigns of Repub-
lican candidates for the House. He
assembled excellent field
forces. And he and Martin
brought into being an ex-
ceptionally effective office
of public relations, which
developed a number of new
and potent campaign meth-
ods. Robert Humphreys, di-
rector of this work and
formerly National Affairs
editor of NEWSWEEK, served
as publicity director of the
Republican National Committee dur-
ing the Eisenhower campaign.

Hall demonstrated tremendous ex-
ecutive skill and dynamic energy as
chairman of the Congressional Com-
mittee. He picked good men, wisely
assigned their tasks, and delegated
authority. He was a good money-
raiser-indispensable in a national
chairman. He knows where to go
and whom to tap. He believes in
organization. There will be no scandal
to dog his heels.

Hall is a big, hearty man with an
infectious smile. The Republican Party
could have no better representative
to rid it of the last hints that it is the
party of a privileged aristocracy. Len
Hall may well be the advance agent
of a new era of Republicanism.

His success with the House commit-
tee admirably fits him for the
next big test, the Congressional cam-
paign in 1954. Taft has summed up
the requirements for victory then as
a good record by the President and
Congress, good means of publicizing
that record, and a big vote. The first
of those tasks is up to President
Eisenhower, Senator Taft, and their
colleagues. The second and part of
the third are up to Hall. The other
part of getting out the vote is up to
all of us.

We may be sure that Hall will do
well at his part of this task. For he
has the qualities of a leader and a
party builder.
