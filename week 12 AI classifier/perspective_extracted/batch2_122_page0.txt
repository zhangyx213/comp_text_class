**The Defense Colossus**

*by Raymond Moley*

SECRETARY MCNAMARA’S impatience, not to say resentment, toward an investigation of the TFX award by the McClellan subcommittee raises certain questions which deserve examination. He should know, if he does not know or has forgotten, that the American people have always been deeply concerned when vast power is concentrated in one individual. Indeed, this Republic was born because Americans were determined to limit and control the exercise of the power of government. Stripped of all legal and philosophical falderal, constitutional government comes down to simple common sense. It is a device for the containment and control of those individuals who temporarily possess power over great affairs. The people who wrote our Constitution quite correctly regarded their fellow man, as one writer has put it, as “a good sort but one who wants watching.” This is especially true when circumstances have created a vast power complex in which overwhelming authority is concentrated in a single individual.

Our defense establishment has been made possible because over the past six or seven decades three great masses of power have emerged in what was earlier a highly decentralized civilization. The first was composed of very large corporate industrial and banking units. The misuse of economic and political power in that sector early in this century gave rise to a Federal establishment vested with large responsibility for control. Later there appeared immense industrywide unions which constituted a third area of power.

**NEW PATTERN**

These power complexes together became what economists have called a system of countervailing powers. The public interest was served by this balance of interests. Political and economic liberty enjoyed other safeguards. There was the marketplace in which competition could operate. The press and other media had access to these complexes. There was Congress with its power of investigation. And there was a vigorous two-party political system.

world war and the armament race which followed created a new power pattern superimposed upon the old ones—a military-industrial complex. This comprises not only the Defense Department but agencies such as the Atomic Energy Commission, the space agency, foreign aid, the CIA, the USIA, and substantial parts of many other agencies and departments. There are also the many industries whose major or only customer is the government, and a large part of the membership of labor unions.

**EISENHOWER’S WARNING**

President Eisenhower, in his farewell speech before leaving the White House, offered this warning:

“This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. The total influence—economic, political, even spiritual—is felt in every city, every statehouse, every office in the Federal government. We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implication. Our toil, resources, and livelihood are all involved; so is the very structure of our society. In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.”

It is against the background of this wise warning and the historical circumstances attending the growth of this defense leviathan that McNamara’s attitude and behavior must be measured. For his authority in the defense complex is exceeded only by that of the President.

The makers of the Constitution decreed civilian control over the military as only one of many devices to keep government the servant and not the master of individual Americans. The essential purpose of constitutional government is to protect liberty. This means that no official head—whether it be covered by a Homburg, a wool hat, or a bespangled military cap—should grow beyond a size appropriate to a good and faithful servant.
