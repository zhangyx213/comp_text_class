**The Hearst Traditions**

*by Raymond Moley*

SANTA BARBARA—It is difficult to comprehend the nature, character, and traditions of William Randolph Hearst from any vantage point except here in California, his native state. For here he began his career, lived most of his life, and here he died. It was here that some of his most intense controversies were fought, here that his roots were deep and vital.

When I was a child in Ohio, my uncle here in Santa Barbara used to send me copies of *The San Francisco Examiner*. I vividly remember the marvelous comics that later became a national sensation. I remember, too, the way Hearst’s treatment of the news broke upon a youngster’s mind. I shall never forget that treatment in a special supplement of the Corbett-Fitzsimmons fight in Carson City, Nevada, on March 17, 1897.

The impact of the Hearst fashion of journalism fell upon a sedate press and inspired in it a fierce struggle for the minds and interests of people who had never read newspapers before. Perhaps it is true, as one newspaper commented since Hearst’s death, that despite this influence, very few non-Hearst newspapers bear any resemblance to the contemporary Hearst press. But much of what they have learned in half a century in reaching into the mass of people for new circulation must be credited to Hearst, and many of them would no longer be in existence except for that leadership. Hearst taught them that there were millions who could read, who had money to buy the things that were advertised, and who had never been reached before he came into the business. Moreover, his extravagant way of hiring attractive writers and editors raised the competitive pay of the working press everywhere.


THERE are those who will deny that Hearst taught people to think about public problems, but it cannot be denied that he made it possible to read with ease editorial opinions about those problems. For Hearst himself wrote simple and powerful prose, and Arthur Brisbane, at Hearst’s direction and under his influence, learned to capture the interest of millions. I venture to say that no editorial writer today can compare in clarity and emphasis with the Hearst who wrote personally in his prime.

The Hearst impact upon political life was less direct and less important than upon journalism, but it was immense and significant, for he was a progressive before “progressivism” was born. He was crusading for a fairer deal for the little fellow and against the economic excesses of the age before the country at large ever heard of Bryan and T.R.

True, he made the mistake of many great journalists and sought the lesser glory and influence of public office. In this he was not successful, thus following the pattern of Greeley and others who momentarily mistook their calling. But he learned his lesson after bitter conflicts and withdrew to San Simeon and thundered his political views through his newspapers.


THERE are those who will say of Hearst, as they did of Bryan, that he started as a liberal and ended as a conservative. Such a judgment, however, not only mistakes the meaning of liberalism and conservatism, but the essential faith of Hearst. It is the liberal name in these latter days that has been lost and stolen. The cult of statism and its sympathy for the Russian experiment is a perversion and not a true product of the progressivism of 40 years ago. It was not Hearst that changed, but the interpretation of the meaning of progress that changed. And in these past two decades, Hearst chose to run against the tide. It will be very difficult for his detractors to ascribe this to anything except the basic fiber of character. For he might have been the prophet of all the New and Fair Deals. He chose, instead, the course of opposition.

His insistence upon fundamental American principles has not been the echo of a discredited past, but a constant reminder to the American people that there is a faith that transcends fashion. If Hearst’s fashions were of another century, his principles of government were eternal. And he has made millions remember them. We can well ponder that fact.
