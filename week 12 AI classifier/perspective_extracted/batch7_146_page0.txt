**Reporting, Comment, and Criticism**
by RAYMOND MOLEY

This writer, in common with virtually every other magazine, newspaper, and radio commentator, has been receiving a larger mail than usual. The first batch, immediately following the election, ranged from mild criticisms of our judgments to scurrilous comments on our sanity, honesty, and parentage. Such abuse is the common lot of those who write for print. Our patience expands with our wastebaskets.

All this would not be worthy of comment, if a definite change in the character of my correspondence had not taken place about a week after the election. The muddy waters cleared, and more rational comments began to arrive.

The encouraging import of these later letters is that a large public which thinks for itself is less concerned with prophecies and polls than with information, interpretation, and constructive criticism. That public which itself shared the error in foresight common to all before this election accepts the verdict but comprehends a future full of grave national decisions, in which the participation of an informed public makes for wisdom and security.

This emphasis has always been the faith and purpose of the best reporters and commentators. Many of them before this election yielded perhaps too much to a demand for prophecy, and suffice it to say that this error has had a beneficial effect.

In studying political affairs, I have always depended on working newspapermen, chiefly local political reporters on papers throughout the country. There are no more experienced, honest, and impartial people in any profession than these men. Their devotion to their work is attested by the fact that some have worked at very moderate pay on the same papers for decades. These men, including, I may add, the 50 Washington correspondents who guessed unanimously in the NEWSWEEK poll that Dewey would be elected, won their professional standing the hard way. They are not fools and knaves, as some Monday quarterbacks would imply. They hold their jobs in a fiercely competitive field—a field from which post-election wisemen are not excluded.

Political reporters in the recent campaign gave the public facts as they saw them. In large part, those facts indicated that Dewey would win. There were inscrutable factors in voters’ minds which were not visible and which were not reported. Those factors determined the result. Omniscience still tarries in heaven, unless, as is hardly credible, President Truman like Joan of Arc heard voices which were inaudible to all others. The reporter, however, cannot wait for heavenly voices. He must go on with the multitudinous events of a busy world, and that is exactly what he intends to do.

The job of a political reporter is to describe the inside, outside, and, if need be, the underside of political life. The commentator reports and also interprets the significance of what goes on. He is also a critic, alert not only to what is, but what should be. And a free press presents all three—reporting, interpretation, and criticism.

Moreover, a free press is never dominated by a desire to follow election returns. This is overlooked by those, like Harold Ickes and the late President Roosevelt, who maintained that the press is all wrong because it so often fails to win elections. The function of the press is to present facts, interpretation, and fair criticism and to let the votes fall where they may.

Critics in fields other than politics are often overruled by public decisions. Lloyd C. Douglas’s novel “The Robe” was severely raked by the critics, but the public bought 2,000,000 copies in this country alone. This, however, does not deter critics from pointing out the defects in the current Douglas book “The Big Fisherman.” The critic’s function is only incidentally to appraise public taste. His function is to apply his experienced knowledge and judgment to a performance, creation, or idea which falls within his field. The public will again have its way, but the critic will keep his conscience.
