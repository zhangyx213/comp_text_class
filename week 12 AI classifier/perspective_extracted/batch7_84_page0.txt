**Dynamic Government**

**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

THE most unusual thing about President Truman's message on the State of the Union was its capacity to gull the gullible. It was carefully designed to hide a tremendous program of socialization behind a glittering cascade of pretty words about freedom and opportunity. This is not a new trick in politics. The amazing thing is that it still works with some people.  One editorial pulpit pronounced it to be "the finest expression of national character and purpose which has come from the White House since the time of Theodore Roosevelt." The message had, according to the same source, the "spirit" of "dynamic America."

The dynamic America the President was talking about was an America which, despite the blundering of government, grew through the spirit of individual effort. It grew because daring and inventive people found opportunity and made the most of it. And because it grew in the past through such forces, it is assumed that a government which proposes to burden and shackle such forces can claim the right to lead us to new frontiers.

THE President uses the good word "opportunity," it is true. But a careful reading of the message shows that opportunity to the President means an opportunity for the government to thrust itself forward as the source of bounty and the fulfiller of dreams. This is not the treasured sense in which opportunity is known to Americans. It is a new and strange design which hides the grasping hand of political power and the blight of statism.

So let us tear away the bright wrappings of the message and look at the substance. For after two or three thousand words, with which everyone can agree, come the same old specifications of the Truman program. The Taft-Hartley Act must be repealed and something else, cut to the specifications of labor leaders, must be enacted.

We must have more and more great power projects to provide electricity, irrigation, and other benefits to be paid for in the far distant future. We must have valley authorities virtually to dominate the states, counties, and the economic life of great regions. Social security must be increased. We must have socialized medicine under government direction and at public expense. We must have more and more Federal grants to the states, notably for schools. We must have a civil-rights program which at least a fourth of our states regard as an invasion of their constitutional liberty.

We must have no foolish efforts to reduce budgetary items. In short, deficit financing must be accepted as a fixed policy. And if more money must be raised by taxation, we must soak the people who are now paying. The Truman program suggests no readjustment of the burden. We must not meanwhile forget our continuing foreign obligations. The cost of all this is only dimly to be seen. Senator Taft estimates "gratuitous payments" in the budget for this fiscal year at more than $6,000,000,000 and next year at about the same figure.

As I have noted previously in this space, the cost of this program in terms of money would ultimately put our national expenditures at $100,000,000,000. It would, moreover, cost us the kind of civilization under which a truly dynamic America grew.

ONE might ask the President as well as his editorial admirers a simple question. If, under our American system, we have done so well in the past 50 years, why should we try the Truman system in the next 50 years?
