**Perspective**

**Commencements—of What?**

It is probable that the people least
affected by commencement orations are
the commencers themselves. Parents are
apt to be moved by them, of course. But
the graduates almost always find their
minds wandering to more immediate prob-
lems in the hours before the last farewells.
Perhaps that’s because they sense so quick-
ly that commencement orations reflect the
general—and therefore obvious—mood of
the times. Perhaps it’s because they can’t
help but discount any sort of exhortation
in which fashionable patterns change so
often and so abruptly.

It takes no looking back over the news-
paper files to know that there have been
at least three basic commencement ora-
tion styles in the past twenty years. For a
time after the Armistice there was the out-
of-the-fiery-ordeal-will-come-a-new-world-
order refrain. Then, as the ’20s wore on,
came the America-is-nothing-but-crass-ma-
terialism theme. Finally, with the depres-
sion, came the strangest of all intellectual
counterpoint—the oh-weep-with-youth-for-
their-elders-are-a-mess motif overlaid on
the there-is-no-God-but-the-majority-and-
government-is-its-prophet theme. All these
are plainly dated now. If the graduates of
those years remember them even dimly
they also know that the new-world-order
was an illusion, that the crass-materialism
pronouncements were a trifle premature
(right now we’d be tickled pink if we
had some more of those crass materials)
and that social gains are only as strong
as the capacity of the nation to pro-
tect them.

So commencement orators are on a
hot spot this year. And before these dusty
troubadours seize their harps and sing “to
freshen pulses old and thin” a suggestion
seems in order. There is a theme that fits
this year—a theme with which the future
cannot easily quarrel. It is the theme of
transition. Specifically, it is that educa-
tional leaders, whether they appreciate it
or not, are faced with something that is
not in their books.

Educational trends always follow, some-
what belatedly at times, great changes of
emphasis in national life, and national life
is swirling into unforeseen readjustments.
Certainly the teachers did not foresee
them. Certainly no one else could or would
have planned them. What is happening is
that this country, forced into a desperate
defense of things of the spirit, suddenly
finds that things of the spirit cannot be


their struggle for a mere survival. A whole
generation of social and educational re-
formers may drink the bitterness at the
bottom of that cup.

Whatever comes, the schoolmaster must
go to school again. And his first lessons he
must learn at the feet of people whom, in
his nicely arranged dream-education, he
has often mistakenly stigmatized as lack-
ing in vision, as incompetent and as reac-
tionary. He must learn from those who
make things, who know how to forge and
hammer and drill. He must learn from
those who know how to manage the work
of those who forge and hammer and drill.

I believe I speak no disparagement of
many of the excellent aspects of many of
our educational institutions when I say
that a boy can learn more now of what
he needs to know from a year in a machine-
tool plant than in a year’s schooling in a
high school or college. Education, as a
trustee, must recognize what this implies
and equip itself hastily, belatedly, perhaps
inadequately, to understand and explain
the actual materials out of which our fu-
ture is being shaped. There will be no fu-
ture for civilization unless that task is ac-
complished.

But there is a distant as well as an
immediate future, and that is the concern
of education too. Facing that distant fu-
ture we must not make snap judgments.
We cannot predict either that it will be
like anything we have known or wholly
unlike anything we have ever known. Only
one thing is certain. There are ideas and
principles that have survived changes as
great as those ahead of us. They have en-
dured through the industrial revolution.
They were old when capitalism, as we
know it, began. They antedate the rise of
national democracy, of nationalism itself.
They existed centuries before the bar-
barian invasions. Economics did not begin
or end with Marx. Politics, as Aristotle
expounded it, was a sound appraisal of
almost every public issue that we now
face. Thomas Aquinas perfected an intel-
lectual method that can give new energy
and meaning to the work of present-day
engineers and managers. And the first
principles of the Jewish and Christian
religions alone can give democracy mean-
ing and preserve personal freedom as a
faith.

If the material things we have created
are not to destroy us, we must again learn
to comprehend our heritage. If these spir-
itual principles and intellectual standards
that have withstood the cynical and ca-
pricious years are not at the core of our
lives, then the fruit is foul. The education
of the future must be profoundly affected
by the fact that America is being saved
in the factories, the machine shops and the
laboratories. And it must give us men and
women who understand what makes Amer-
ica worth saving.


defended without things that are made by
brains and hands and machines. Love of
freedom, willingness to die for it, are not
enough. Instruments of steel must be
forged to defend it. A security created by
the products of a material civilization is
the minimum, but the indispensably mini-
mum requisite. And this means if it
means anything, that the entire process
of education, the whole structure of cul-
ture must place a new emphasis upon the
American industrial process.

The state of the world is pretty
good evidence that the efforts of education
to teach people more about relations be-
tween individuals and among nations are
still grossly inadequate. Those who profess
to teach the social and political “sciences,”
in particular, can accuse themselves of
woeful errors. They have failed in the job
of hardening the minds and lifting the
imagination of young people by a frank
appraisal of the great uncertainties of hu-
man life. This is because they wanted edu-
cation to be sugar-coated, to be easy. It
was easy to picture the government as the
benevolent god in whose happy heaven all
will find the things they want. It was easy,
less “dull,” for the social and political
“scientists” to divorce themselves from the
classical principles. A course on Plato’s
“Republic” was sure to be less popular
than a course of field trips to public mar-
kets and community welfare agencies. A
mood has run through education that was
marked by a sedulous determination in
each new crop of teachers to pooh-pooh
what their own teachers had said and
written. Because they discarded the
principles as well as the illusions of their
predecessors, the successive structures
that they created became flimsier and
flimsier.

It is not surprising, then, that in the
field of international relations they should
discover the idea of international coopera-
tion foundering in the sea of human self-
ishness once more or that they must face
the fact that any new so-called new order
may well be based upon the familiar wa-
tery surface of national advantage. They
have found, too, that personal security
cannot be guaranteed within a nation that
fails first to make secure its own existence.
