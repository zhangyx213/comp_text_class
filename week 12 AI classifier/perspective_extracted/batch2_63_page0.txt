**PERSPECTIVE**

**PARTY CONTROL**

BY RAYMOND MOLEY

In the political comment before, during, and after the San Francisco convention the expression “party control” was frequently used. But what does party control mean? Is there such a thing? If so, what does it mean in the Republican Party now, after Goldwater’s clear margin of victory in winning the nomination?

In this political context the word “control” is different than when we speak of control of a corporation. In that case, a majority of the stockholders selects a board of directors to its liking; the board then selects top management and defines policies, and the management enforces discipline all along the line.

But a party is many things. Nobody “runs” a party. It is a loose aggregation of many, semi-independent units. The name of the party may be all they have in common.

**INFLUENCE IN CONGRESS**

There are at present the two Republican minority groups—one in the Senate, the other in the House. Each has its chosen officers and leaders. The leaders maintain a rather loose influence over the members. This cannot be called control. In recent years these Republican groups in Congress have done a good deal of constructive work in drafting policy statements and in seeking unity on the issues before Congress. On the Democratic side, policy is almost always determined by the White House.

Goldwater’s influence in Congress, even if he loses, will remain strong. He has been there and has been a team worker, even if he has sometimes acted independently in voting. He is respected by his colleagues as one who understands the problems faced by legislators. This is especially true of most of the younger House members who fairly well conform to the ideological views of the senator.

The Republican Congressional Committee under Bob Wilson is an operating agency issuing party statements and helping House candidates. It is important to note that only twice since the accession of T.R. in 1901 have Republican Presidential candidates served in Congress. Harding had been an undistinguished senator, and Richard Nixon had been a freshman senator. The others were greatly hampered by their lack of knowledge of a member’s problems and, unless they won the Presidency, had little influence in Congress later.

Then there is the Republican National Committee. Since it has been selected by the delegations to the recent convention and since the great majority of those delegations supported Goldwater, the new national committee will be highly responsive to Goldwater. But the national committee seldom meets. Its business is done by committees and the chairman.

Looking toward the future, Goldwater named a friend who participated in his campaign for the nomination, Dean Burch, as chairman. Denison Kitchel, who was the general campaign director before San Francisco, will stay for the duration of the campaign but will probably retire after the election. The staff of the national committee, which operates under the directives of the chairman, will be reorganized by the new chairman, from top to bottom. It will be built into a more effective instrument of Republican propaganda and its relations with state organizations will be strengthened.

**GOLDWATER’S ROLE**

Perhaps the major factor in the new Republican regime will be Goldwater himself. He will not permit his status as titular leader of the party to recede by neglect as did Landon, Willkie, Dewey, and, in a lesser degree, Nixon after defeat. He will no doubt make party work his major vocation. He has the personal means to do this. He will maintain constant contacts with Republicans in the states and in Congress and with the national committee.

To appraise the role of Goldwater himself in this party reorientation, the nature and inclinations of the man himself must be considered. He cares nothing at all about the hidden wire-pulling which is the delight of so many politicians. He hates indirection in speech. He is no orator who ignites mass emotions. He is concerned with the teaching or, if you will, preaching function in public life. In this role he will continue to serve, regardless of the outcome in November. That is how he won the following that gave him the nomination.
