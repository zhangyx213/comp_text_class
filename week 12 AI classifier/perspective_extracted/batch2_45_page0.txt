**VIEWS OF A VETERAN**

**BY RAYMOND MOLEY**

John W. Bricker, recalling his days in the Senate, commented after this year's election that the chaplain of that body once said in his prayer: "God give us a mandate higher than the ballot box." In the light of recent events, Bricker meant that the voters did not accept the Johnson program, but, rather, rejected what they were led to believe Goldwater might do if elected. The issues that really concern the people were hardly debated at all.

I have sought Bricker's views on the GOP's future because no one in the past has so clearly appraised the thinking of Ohio voters—and Ohio ever since the Civil War has most accurately reflected national sentiment. And Bricker, freed from further quest of public office and with his mind enriched by long experience in politics, is able to make the long and impartial estimates so necessary to the party's future.

The Eastern press has never accorded Bricker the credit he has deserved. This has been because the late Robert A. Taft held the center of the stage so long. And Bricker loyally supported Taft's three tries for the nomination. Taft was called Mr. Republican. But Bricker deserved the title of Mr. Ohio. He has always held a warm place in the hearts of Republican leaders throughout the country.

In 1944, when he was a candidate in his own right and Dewey won the nomination, the Republicans, with an enthusiasm and unanimity I had never seen in a convention, gave Bricker second place on the ticket.

**WISE FORECASTER**

He won successive elections in Ohio—first as attorney general, three times as governor, and twice as United States senator. In 1958 when he narrowly lost, he had warned certain businessmen not to put right-to-work on the ballot that year. His forebodings were amply justified.

On many occasions I have sought Bricker's predictions before elections. In 1950 when all the newspapermen in Ohio predicted Taft's defeat, Bricker told me they were wrong. And they were. In 1960, when the press gave Ohio to Kennedy, Bricker gave the approximate majority which Nixon actually received. In 1962 he guessed, two weeks before the election, the number of Congressional seats the GOP would win and the ones that they would lose. He was proved right.

His uncanny sense of voter opinion in Ohio commends his views on what the GOP should consider in seeking a comeback. For while Ohio has large industrial centers, the decision usually follows what happens in the suburbs, the smaller communities, and the rural counties.

**CONTINUING CONCERNS**

"I have seen the time," he says, "when the Republican Party had fewer governors and a lower membership in Congress than it will have in 1965." After the great defeat in 1936 the reaction came in 1938, when Bricker and Taft were both elected in Ohio and there was a strong Republican tide over the nation. "Certainly," he added, "this is no time to quarrel about who is to be blamed for losing this election. It is too early to hold conferences of leaders, real or pseudo. Surely, those who would rule or ruin the Republican Party should not be charged with rebuilding it. A Republican program must come from internal reconciliation of opposing viewpoints."

It is Bricker's opinion that there is still deep concern over the immense increase of Presidential power which may follow this landslide. Congress will for the time respond to the President's wishes. The people are also concerned about the Supreme Court's invasion of the realm of policy-making. This centers upon the questions of school prayer and reapportionment, which must come before the next Congress in the form of constitutional amendments.

The reaction against "too much Johnson," Bricker believes, may come sooner than most of us think.

Meanwhile, he says, the Republican Party must rebuild not only in its own interest but in the interest of the two-party system, for the continuance of that system is essential to the preservation of representative republican government. History has repeatedly demonstrated that multiple parties lead to instability and anarchy and that a one-party system leads to tyranny.
