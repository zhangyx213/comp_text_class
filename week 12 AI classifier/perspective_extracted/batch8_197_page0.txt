**Perspective**

**The Chrysler Strike**

A t a staggering cost to itself, the
Chrysler Corporation has stated an issue
for all of industry. Engaged though it is
in a business that is highly competitive, it
has seen its production stopped rather
than yield to demands that look to the
control and direction of industry by labor.
In the long Chrysler strike almost every
basic problem of labor-management rela-
tionship has been involved at one moment
or another. For a few days, one issue came
to the fore. Then another. Then still an-
other. All of which indicates conclusively
that there are not issues here, but an issue,
and that the Chrysler Corporation has de-
cided to settle that issue for a long time
to come. Perhaps the C.I.O. has made a
like decision, although it has concealed
its intentions by many disclaimers.
Brushing aside frills, the question asked
by Chrysler management is whether it
can have sufficient freedom and adequate
facilities to carry out its responsibility for
the process of production.
The issue of wages, despite the asser-
tions of the U.A.W.-C.I.O., was apparently
incidental. Chrysler workers are well paid
even according to the standards of a blue-
chip industry. But in the midst of a discus-
sion of wages the foreman issue arose.
Foremen in one of the plants had organ-
ized a union under the C.I.O. This union
thereupon requested a collective-bargain-
ing meeting with the management. The
management refused on the ground that a
demand for the control of foremen amount-
ed to a demand for the control of produc-
tion. Later the foremen's union withdrew
its request, but it did not then withdraw
a complaint it had lodged against the cor-
poration with the NLRB.
Thus, after apparently conceding the
issue of production control early in the
strike, the C.I.O. permitted the same issue
to be raised in another form. This incon-
sistency provided the corporation with
good cause for genuine indignation. It is
not easy to conduct rational negotiations
under such circumstances.
The corporation insisted that, regardless
of the distinction between the C.I.O.-
U.A.W. and the C.I.O. foremen's union
alleged by union leaders, the fact was that
both were branches of the parent C.I.O. It
said further that in any agreement the
corporation must be assured, as it was in
the old contract signed by John L. Lewis,
that foremen would not be classed with
employes.


The point is that foremen are the repre-
sentatives of the management in day-to-
day dealings with employes. They see that
work is properly done, maintain discipline
among employes, hear and judge minor
grievances in the first instance and gener-
ally operate as the first line of management
in the shop. To do this, they must in all
common sense be responsible to the man-
agement and not in any contractual or
organizational sense to the C.I.O. To per-
mit the latter is, as the corporation pointed
out, to deny to the management its repre-
sentative "at the very point where collec-
tive bargaining begins." It is impossible to
have bargaining when members of the
C.I.O. sit on both sides of the table. The
corporation properly demanded that "an
embarrassment concerning the dual capac-
ity of the foreman would not arise in the
life of the new agreement."
On this point the NLRB is ultimately, if
not in this strike, likely to get itself in a
nice bit of confusion. It has already pro-
hibited management from influencing,
through its foremen, the organization of
unions among employes. But if it per-
mits foremen to join the very organization
to which employes generally belong, it will
deny the management power to enforce
upon foremen its own rule of non-interfer-
ence.
If foremen are thus to be separated
from management there will be no direct
contact between employers and the rank
and file. Spies and other indirect contacts
will be encouraged; responsibility will be
confused, and ultimately management will
have little means of controlling the proc-
ess of production. Here is an issue that
goes to the foundation of the industrial
process. The Chrysler Corporation de-
serves the gratitude of all management for
bringing it into the open. It also deserves
public commendation for maintaining one
of the fundamentals of private enterprise.

**Labor on the Carpet**

For years many of our most far-
sighted economists and businessmen have
vainly pointed to the building industry as
the logical path out of our economic maze.
Unquestionably one of the most serious
obstacles to the development and expan-
sion of a sound industry has been the pol-
icy of the building-trades unions.
Thurman Arnold, Assistant Attorney
General, has undertaken to do something
about them. Last week he addressed a let-
ter to the secretary of the Central Labor

Union of Indianapolis announcing softly,
almost apologetically, that labor has no
more right than anyone else to organize
in unreasonable restraint of trade (NEWS-
WEEK, Nov. 27). The Department of Jus-
tice, he said, considers illegal "unreason-
able restraints" designed to prevent the
use of cheaper material, improved equip-
ment or more efficient methods; to compel
the hiring of useless and unnecessary labor;
to enforce systems of graft and extortion;
to enforce illegally fixed prices; and to
destroy an established and legitimate sys-
tem of collective bargaining.
If building-industry unions have in-
dulged in any of these restraints, it may be
argued that the unions are doing nothing
employers have not taught them to do.
The employers may make the codes, but
they could never police such codes for
themselves without running afoul of the
Sherman Act and state laws.
So eager is Mr. Arnold not to tread too
hard on labor's toes that in his letter he
states that the Department of Justice, in
its "anxiety to be fair to labor," will not
subject the labor unions to criminal prose-
cutions for violation of the antitrust laws.
But Mr. William Green, whose Ameri-
can Federation of Labor has most of the
labor organizations in the building field,
is not thankful for the thoughtful dis-
crimination or the soft words. Taking ref-
uge in the age-old defense that the Clay-
ton Act exempted labor unions from anti-
trust litigation, Mr. Green in his answer
makes no defense of the practices con-
demned by the Assistant Attorney Gen-
eral. He says that, while labor unions
should not go unpunished if they engage
in illegal practices, the antitrust laws are
not applicable.
The C.I.O. has, of course, remained si-
lent, but it is a pleased silence. Engaged
at present in an attempted raid on the
A.F.L.'s building-trades unions, C.I.O. offi-
cials showed a fine sense of timing when
they announced the signing of their first
building contract in Washington, D.C., on
the same day that Mr. Green's letter was
made public. Though not particularly suc-
cessful in its attempt to win the building
tradesmen away from their traditional
A.F.L. unions, and though the attempted
raid is not being backed by more conserva-
tive leaders like Sidney Hillman, the C.I.O.
is momentarily delighted with Mr. Arnold's
slap at their enemy.
The immediate effect of Mr. Arnold's
action will be to slow up temporarily the
snail-like progress of the construction in-
dustry. As evidence of collusion between
labor, contractors, and distributors is re-
vealed, the public will hold back, waiting
for the shake-up to bring prices down. But
it is to be hoped that, after a few months,
results of Mr. Arnold's campaign will be
seen in lowering of prices of building ma-
terials and labor.
