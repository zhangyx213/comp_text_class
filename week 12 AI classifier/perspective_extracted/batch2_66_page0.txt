A PARTY REVOLUTION

BY RAYMOND MOLEY

Los Angeles—Eastern and Northeast-
ern politicians and erstwhile lead-
ers, as well as those who interpret
them for us, fail to realize that in
attacking Goldwater they are tilting
at a symbol rather than a reality.
The reality is a protest, deep and
wide and powerful, among Repub-
licans, homeless Democrats, and the
politically unattached against past
Republican Party control and also the
sort of government we have had dur-
ing the last 25 years. This protest has
grown in the past decade from a
mere difference of opinion to a veri-
table revolution. It arose from nat-
ural developments—a great shift of
population and of economic power
and social change.

It was so when the Jeffersonians
overthrew the Federalists in 1800
and when in the age of Jackson the
frontier revolted against the built-in
Washington bureaucracy, King Cau-
cus, and the Bank of the United
States. It was so when the Republi-
can Party was born out of the ashes
of the Whigs. And also when West-
ern "progressives" started a move-
ment which ended in the Republican
schism in 1912. It was so when Frank-
lin D. Roosevelt tore the Democratic
Party away from its traditional moor-
ings in the 1930s.

FORCE AND OPTIMISM

Since the beginning of World War
II there has been a tremendous shift
of population, of wealth, and cultural
and educational leadership from the
East and Northeast to the West and
South. Between 1950 and 1960 the
most rapidly growing regions have
been the Pacific Coast, with a gain of
40 per cent (this is larger now), the
mountain area with 35 per cent, and
the Southeastern states with 22 per
cent. Also, Texas has had a gain of
24 per cent.

I have seen this change from year
to year in the course of eleven round
trips by automobile between the
coasts and during six trips through
the South during that period.

There has also been a great move-
ment of people into urban areas from
the rural counties and from the North
and East. The latter have moved
there because of the location of so
many industrial plants in areas with
a favorable business climate and

which are closer to their raw mate-
rials and also to their markets. The
vivid impression one gets in those
cities and sprawling suburbs is force,
energy, optimism, and progress. With
a few exceptions, they are not wait-
ing for help from Washington. They
want to grow, exploit their natural
advantages. People want to own their
homes, educate their children, and
realize other benefits of a new life.

THE BOURBONS

In politics there is always a lag of
years before natural changes such as
these are reflected in the thinking of
observers. There is an old German
saying that things are faster than
thoughts. Before a philosophical sys-
tem is thought out and written, the
world on which it was based has
passed away. The minds of those who
promoted the Willkie nomination in
1940 and the three which followed
fail to comprehend what has been
happening in the nation during those
years. Until the threat of a Gold-
water nomination loomed a year ago,
those people were happy in "anticipa-
tion of yesterday afternoon." When a
glimpse of the reality of Goldwater's
strength appeared, there was at first
doubt, then consternation, and later,
hysterical frustration.

Their immoderate language belies
their claims to be moderate. They
prate about looking forward when
they are still scanning the past. The
names of the illustrious dead are
invoked to drive away Goldwater's
demand for a change. They talk
about a mainstream, although the
main channel has long left their prov-
inces. These are not the progressives
of our time. They are the Bourbons
who never learn and never forget.
When the Duc de La Rochefoucauld-
Liancourt rushed to Versailles with
the news of the fall of the Bastille
on July 14, 1789, the King said:
"But, it is a revolt!" The answer
was: "Sire, it is not a revolt—it is
a revolution."

It is not coincidence that Gold-
water's support is greatest and most
firm in areas where there has been
the most marked growth. Goldwater
may win or lose, but this revolution is
a durable fact. The Republican Party
will never be the same after the
nomination this year.
