Joe Louis's Greatest Fight
by Raymond Moley

IT SHOULD be recorded for the his-
tory books that at a time when a
cynical contempt for morality has
reached the highest places in the land,
an unlettered member of a race rising
from slavery has held the light of in-
tegrity high enough for all Americans
to see. Time was when moral example
came from high office. Now the in-
spiration comes from below the line of
privilege and opportunity.

The Louis saga hardly
needs to be told. A young-
ster with little or no school-
ing and handicapped by his
color, attracted attention by
his brawn, his courage, and
a willingness to work and
learn. He entered a trade
riddled with shoddy morals
and peopled in part by the
underworld. He shuffled
ahead in this track, asking no favors,
meeting all comers, with never a boast,
never an alibi, and never a default.
No champion in his class ever fought
so often and won so consistently. His
professional contacts were sometimes
with grimy people, but sports writers
tell us that none of the grime came
off on Joe. And something in him
measurably made them better and
prize fighting better.

Then the war came when he was at
the very top of his capacities and earn-
ing power. He did his duty, and re-
turned an old man as fighters go. He
returned to find times were good and
the land was flush with money. Joe
was hard up and burdened with debt.

YES, he had made a great deal
when pretenders were falling be-
fore his skill and strength. But his
business was fighting, not finance. He
had made mistakes, as did many of
the rest of us. He managed his money
badly. Great sums had faded away
through bad investments. Whoever
helped him with the mysteries of the
income tax had not done well. Louis
owed the government a great deal.

It never occurred to him to do any-
thing but pay. Dozens of gamblers
had made big money on his fights
and, according to Senate committees,
either failed to pay taxes at all or
"fixed" the government. That was not
the way Louis fought.

Joe had obligated himself to pay
what seems an excessive amount to his
former wife for the support of little
Joe and Jacqueline. His annuity nest
egg of $50,000 he had given away to
needy buddies in the army. So he
scraped together what he could and
started to pay the government. Finally,
there was no way to pay more except
to put on the gloves and fight again.

This was a dreadful personal choice.
He knew that to go on in the ring
when what sports writers
call "reflexes" are failing is
to end a dazed, deaf, and
witless derelict. Before him
was the example of Sam
Langford, who fought them
all in his day but ended
blind and penniless in a
back room in Harlem. This
risk Louis took because he
was an honest man and
fighting was the only way
to pay his debts and clear the slate.

Those fights over this past year or
more were not fine exhibitions, but
they ought to be remembered as the
most glorious of an unparalleled ca-
reer. The punishments Louis took, the
long grinds of training, the disappoint-
ments when his body could not do
what his brain told it to do would
have destroyed a less vital character.

For in there against him were sub-
jective matters which he was trying
to beat the humiliation of debt, the
threat of dependence, and the temp-
tation to compromise.

When an awkward youngster named
Marciano drove him through the
ropes, perhaps for good, he still owed
the government. Even then, he re-
fused to quit. He says he must think
about it. That means he must find
out how much more there is to pay.

MEANWHILE, we see the evidence
accumulate that it is not Louis
but the American people who are
suffering humiliation. All over the
nation there is appearing the sordid
record of Internal Revenue officers,
well-placed political lawyers, and busi-
nessmen who have found it cheaper
to bribe than to pay taxes. The in-
fection has apparently spread in the
Bureau of Internal Revenue. Time will
tell how high it went. It is a shameful
lesson to a careless generation.

It remained for Joe Louis to remind
us of what American integrity used
to be, should be, and can be.
