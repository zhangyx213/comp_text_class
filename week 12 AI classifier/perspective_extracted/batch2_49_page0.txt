**PERSPECTIVE**

**HE WON OVER DEFEAT**

**BY RAYMOND MOLEY**

The most vital test of a man's character is not how he behaves after success, but how he sustains defeat. The tributes which have appeared on all sides since the passing of Herbert Hoover have noted the massive public service which he contributed to his country and the world since he left the White House in March 1933. He was then a frustrated and indescribably wearied man, after nearly four years of bitter battle against an economic disaster for which even his former enemies now realize he was not responsible.

I was present with President-elect Roosevelt on the three occasions between the election and the inauguration four months later when he and Hoover conferred about measures of cooperation. The failure of cooperation will be the subject of historical speculation for years to come. It is not relevant here and now.

I remember best a moment when Herbert Hoover rose magnificently above defeat. It was at the Gridiron Club dinner only a month after the election. The spirit of that occasion was pregnant with anticipation of a new regime. Almost unrestrained confidence emanated from those who were attached in one way or another to the fortunes of the coming Administration. But even this Roosevelt orientation was stemmed for the moment by the unforgettable message by the man who had lost.

**HOOVER'S HUMILITY**

At this time, nothing could provide a better tribute to the statesman whose life ebbed away two weeks ago than what he said that night in 1932. His first words carried a measure of dry humor:

"You will expect me to discuss the late election. Well, as nearly as I can learn, we did not have enough votes on our side. During the campaign I remarked that this Administration had been fighting on a thousand fronts; I learned since the campaign that we were fighting on 21 million fronts."

He continued: "I notice in the press a generous suggestion that my countrymen owe to me some debt. I have said in part elsewhere that, on the contrary, the obligation is mine. My country gave me, as it gives every boy and every girl, a chance. It gave me schooling, the precious freedom of equal opportunity for advancement in life, for service and honor. In no other land could a boy from a country village without inheritance or influential friends look forward with unbounded hope. It gave to me a certain measure of success in my profession. It conferred upon me the honor of administering the world's response to the appeal of hundreds of millions of afflicted people during and after the war. It gave me high place in the war councils of the nation. My country called upon me to represent it in the reconstruction of human and economic relations between former enemies on the continent of Europe after the armistice. It gave me an opportunity for service in the Cabinets of two Presidents. It gave me the highest honor that comes to manâ€”the Presidency of the United States. For this fullness of life, for the chance to serve in many emergencies, I am indebted to my country beyond any human power to repay.

**TRANSITORY POWER**

"Only a few rare souls in a century, to whose class I make no pretension, count much in the great flow of this Republic. The life stream of this nation is the generations of millions of human particles acting under impulses of advancing ideas and national ideals gathered from a thousand springs. These springs and rills have gathered into great streams which have nurtured and fertilized this great land over these centuries. Its dikes against dangerous floods are cemented with the blood of our fathers

"We are but transitory officials in government whose duty is to keep these channels clear and to strengthen and extend their dikes. What counts toward the honor of public officials is that they sustain the national ideals upon which are patterned the design of these channels of progress and the construction of these dikes of safety."

This address is preserved in a small but out-of-print book, "Hoover After Dinner," edited by Theodore Joslin. The most recent and most sympathetic Hoover biography is by Eugene Lyons, "Herbert Hoover, A Biography."
