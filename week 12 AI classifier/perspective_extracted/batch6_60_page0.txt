**Three Books**

by Raymond Moley

THREE books have appeared during the past few weeks which are worthy of note this political summer. They are not related one to the other, nor are they of equal merit.

The first, by my NEWSWEEK colleague, Henry Hazlitt, will be of long-lasting value. It is "The Free Man's Library" and is a descriptive and critical bibliography of conservative books on economics and related subjects. It is a perfect answer to people who ask, after they have read criticisms of the flood of collectivist texts that are so prevalent in academic instruction in economics: "What should I read to get the other side?"

A great number of books of conservative thought are listed, and Hazlitt in each case has provided a thumbnail sketch of what the book contains. Hazlitt explains that he had long considered the idea of such a compilation and had kept postponing the task. Then he learned that 30 years ago a similar compilation had been published in London under the title "The Philosophy of Individualism: A Bibliography." That book, long out of print, provided the nucleus around which Hazlitt built his present compilation. No one who cherishes economic and political liberty should overlook this guide to the best reading of the ages.

**SCANDALS**

Jules Abels' "The Truman Scandals" is a notable campaign document. It also has lasting value as the story of how a great reform movement, sincerely started in 1932, degenerated into a shabby scramble for pelf disguised under high talk about "social justice," "security," and "the era of the common man." The Abels book is a detailed and documented account of what was called in 1952 "the mess in Washington."

The author's publisher, Henry Regnery, received a letter which comes close to being a precious bit of Trumaniana-i.e., one of those letters written by the 33rd President in haste and maybe repented at leisure. For in answer to the presentation of a free copy, Mr. Truman's secretary replied that his boss had received the "scandal book" and wanted the author to know that it is a pack of lies, misrepresentations, etc., etc. Robert J. Donovan's "The Inside Story" is also a campaign book.

Apparently under the illusion that a friendly account of the Administration would be useful in an election year, the White House secretariat gave Donovan, a respected Washington correspondent, access to classified documents, minutes of staff and Cabinet meetings, and personal letters of the President. We are told what this or that member of the Administration said or thought about this or that, and what the President did or did not decide to do in certain instances. Obviously the slant is that of the author, who is apparently an Eisenhower admirer who wishes, oh so ardently, that Eisenhower were not a Republican. This attitude is hardly conducive to objectivity.

There have been severe and justified criticisms by members of the press of the action of the White House in giving this sort of exclusive treatment to one correspondent, one newspaper, and one publisher.

**INSIDE STUFF**

But a much more serious criticism of the White House secretariat is in order. There is revealed in this book not only the good and, judged by the event, the correct advice the President received along the way, but the foolish and unwise advice as well. This revelation of discussions in the Cabinet and elsewhere, hitherto regarded as secret and confidential, will probably result in drying up the flow of frank counsel that the President desperately needs every day. Suppose you were the adviser who in the economic stress of 1953-54 recommended a crash pump-priming program. And suppose you read later that not only did the President ignore your advice but that a wiser head, Secretary Humphrey, advised against precipitate action and was proved to be right. You would be inclined either to resign or to clam up forever after, when a crisis presented itself. For no one wants to have his follies aired by the person who has asked for candid opinion on what was regarded as a confidential matter. This is the lasting damage that an overanxious palace guard has done for the President.
