**Stassen of Minnesota**

by RAYMOND MOLEY

ST. PAUL—With all allowance for the extravagance which characterizes the talk of Gov. Harold E. Stassen's friends, it must be admitted that he has done a whale of a lot in his 36 years. If proof of the value of a free society were needed, his career, which both parallels and refutes the rise of the philosophic pessimism of the past decade or so, would be a fine piece of evidence.

In 1929 Stassen, and another young man named Ryan, started to practice law in South St. Paul. Neither boy showed a disposition to toil at the job of building a durable practice, but Stassen was elected county attorney in 1930, and Ryan soon found his way to Congress. While Stassen was running for office, the relentless claim of nature pounded down upon the 23-year-old, who had driven himself too hard. A bad lung appeared. He went down for a count of some six or eight months. That would have slowed up most men a few years. But not Stassen. He was active and popular as county attorney, neglected no opportunity to bring his sterling qualities to the public attention and, in 1938, swept into the governorship. That was going some for a young man nine years out of law school.

Like those of three other governors discussed in this series—Warren, Saltonstall and Dewey—his election was a conservative swing away from state rule which was long on social reform and short on administrative efficiency. Minnesota had the colorful Floyd Olson for three terms and Elmer Benson for one. Both men were Farmer Laborites. Apparently the farmers and laborers forgot that somebody had thought up a party for them when Stassen came along.

Now, at 36, this tall, clean-cut man looks at you over his desk with the air of a veteran who seems to feel that this governorship business has taken about all the time he can spare. Last fall Stassen announced that, if elected, he would serve only until April. The voters' bid for even a little of his time was by as large a percentage as in 1938. There is nothing phony about his relinquishment of the governorship. His resignation will take effect at the end of the legislative session this month. There will be no strings on the governorship. But if, after his service in the Navy, something else suitable comes along, Stassen will no doubt be available. This leaves his Presidential prospects in an awkward situation. Unless a party draft proves strong enough to release him from the Navy, 1944 is apparently out. His availability in 1948 depends upon many things, including the 1944 outcome and his own ability to keep himself before the public.

Among the many impressions you get from Stassen are two which, at first blush, seem unfavorable, but which hint of qualities that can be first-rate assets to the public. The first is intense seriousness; the other, a certain simple, almost naïve approach to public problems.

The first is characteristic of the North countries, from which his ancestors came. His speeches might be accompanied by one of Grieg's most somber scores. But that serious mien is in keeping with the times. Stassen sees nothing funny about waste and incompetence in government or about war. He is right, of course. We will need a lot of serious fellows to clear up after our years of economic gaiety.

His simple belief in government's capacity to reform itself, rather than everybody else, is good for this cynical generation. Finding his state overloaded with unnecessary employees, he cut the total by one-quarter, got through a genuine civil-service system and appointed a state business manager. He secured a labor law everyone seems to like and is making a real battle to pile up some money for postwar needs. He found the state in the red. He reduced its debt $27,000,000, covered overdrafts of $8,000,000 more, and is resisting demands for tax reduction because he hopes to establish a surplus of $12,000,000 in the current year.

The country has been hearing a lot from Governor Stassen recently. He wants to help build public sentiment for international collaboration after the war, and the time he has before entering the silences of the Navy is short. It is characteristic of him that his postwar suggestions are vastly more detailed than those of most other public men discussing the subject these days. Perhaps they are too exact for this stage. But if the war leaves people in the mood for greater internationalism, Stassen may well be remembered as one of its major prophets.
