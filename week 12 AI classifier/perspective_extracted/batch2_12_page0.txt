**WHAT A PARTY CAN'T DO**

**BY RAYMOND MOLEY**

Now that the dust has settled upon the comments which followed the announcement of the Free Society Association by its honorary chairman, Barry Goldwater, a bit of clarification is in order. I have certain qualifications for this, because I was one of the first individuals consulted about such an organization by Denison Kitchel, who originated the idea shortly after the election. In the announcement I was listed publicly as one of the group which endorsed the plan.

The association's purpose is exactly what the announcement said. It is nonpartisan. It is concerned with ideas, information, education. It is responsibly conservative, although it should be noted that the word "conservative" is not mentioned in the announcement.

**NO REPUBLICAN ADJUNCT**

It is not an adjunct or auxiliary of the Republican Party. It is not a political party. It will not endorse candidates or participate in political campaigns. It welcomes members of both parties and also the politically homeless. It is quite incorrect to call it a "splinter." Therefore, it is not a counterpart of the ADA.

Through various media of communication it will comment upon public questions. Some of its most promising publications will be what are called the New Federalist Papers. These will be small booklets, each considering a public issue or idea in some depth. These will follow the pattern of the classic essays of Madison and Hamilton and also the more recent Hobart Papers in Britain.

The Hobart Papers are monographs published since 1956 by the British Institute of Economic Affairs. The chief aim is "to spread understanding of basic economic principles, expressing them in plain language, relating them to everyday problems, and distinguishing between the economic requirements of a free society and the political expedients that often govern public policy... to contribute a stream of authoritative, objective, and readable commentary into the shaping of economic opinion."

This may seem to some "practical" politicians theoretical, academic and highbrow. But I am also qualified to remind these critics that the ideas of the original New Deal came from the academic community, and the Democratic Party has been successfully exploiting—and perverting—those ideas ever since.

The association looks to the long pull ahead, when a generation coming to maturity will look for something more meaningful than the slogans and catchwords of the parties. Party "dialogue" does not educate or elucidate. Campaigns may excite and, as in 1964, frighten. They confuse and obscure the realities.

To throw sober, rational and responsible light upon public issues can have a useful effect upon both political parties. For parties are but brokers. They will "sell" whatever they believe the public wants. And the more the public is informed, the greater its demand will be for more enlightened government policies.

Political parties as such cannot provide real educational material. For whenever a statement of principles is issued, it bears the heavy imprint of compromise. That is why party platforms are so soon forgotten.

**UNFORGOTTEN QUESTIONS**

One of the principal advantages in the association is that it can serve to rescue the cause of true conservatism from irresponsible extremist groups. Innumerable people have joined these because they have had nowhere else to register their protest. It was clear after the election that the field should not be left open only to such groups.

Barry Goldwater was chosen as honorary chairman of this association because since he appeared on the national scene twelve years ago he has carried on a crusade which has inspired millions of Americans to think seriously about national trends. He has no intention to use his position in this association to further any personal political ambition. Moreover, despite the confusion of the 1964 campaign, it must be admitted in the sober aftermath a year later that Goldwater asked certain questions which should not be forgotten.

To be sure, the value of the association must be judged by its performance. That is true of any organized effort in any field of human endeavor.
