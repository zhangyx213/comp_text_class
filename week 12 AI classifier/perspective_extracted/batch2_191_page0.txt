**PERSPECTIVE**

**Big-City Politics**

by Raymond Moley

ISOLATED political battles hinge upon
an assortment of factors. But the
outcome of a protracted conflict be-
tween parties depends upon what
they do to resolve a relatively few
factors. One of these is organization.
Since 1960 a preoccupation of many
Republicans with odds and ends of
ideology has led some to a belief that
future success will depend upon win-
ning over Democratic voters by a
sincere leap to the left. Others dwell
upon the energetic propagation of
conservative doctrines. And then
there are those who indulge in mutual
back-scratching, an enervating pas-
time at best.

But in the months since Mr. Ken-
nedy's narrow triumph no more con-
structive work has been done nor
closer attention given any aspect of
Nixon's defeat than the Big City Re-
port by a committee under Ohio Re-
publican State Chairman Ray Bliss. It
was Bliss who put Ohio first among
states for Nixon in 1960. Two years
before, the Ohio Republican ticket
had been rent from top to bottom by
a Democratic-organized labor coali-
tion. The report of Bliss's committee
of sixteen party leaders bears the
stamp of perhaps our most sagacious
political organizer in two decades.
Republicans hoping to find here
magic formulas, ways to swing urban
liberals to the Republican ranks, or
policy lines that will convert the un-
convertible will not only be disap-
pointed. They will pale at the
prospect of hard labor ahead.

**WHAT HAPPENED**

Bliss's group, unlike a platform com-
mittee, spent eight months studying
what happened in the big cities in
1960, analyzing ways to cut down
metropolitan losses, and examining the
mechanics and techniques of cam-
paigning in urban centers. Had a bet-
ter job been done in some of these,
the Republican Party could have won
the election by carrying eight more
states with 173 electoral votes. But
in state after state-monotonously-
Nixon came up to the big city lines
with a thumping lead, only barely to
lose it by margins piled up by Demo-
cratic organizations and labor's COPE.
Nixon lost Pennsylvania in the pre-
cincts of Philadelphia; Michigan in
Detroit; Illinois in Chicago, and Mis-
souri in St. Louis-a total of 102 elec-
toral votes in these four states alone.
Of 32 cities outside the Deep South
with more than 300,000 population,
only nine produced Republican ma-
jorities. In the South Republicans won
five of nine such cities. Only about
32 per cent of the 123 Congressional
districts of these 41 cities went Repub-
lican, a measure of weakness.

**WHAT IS NEEDED**

The Bliss report makes clear that
Republican organizations in many big
cities have lacked adequate resources
in funds and manpower to com-
pete with well-financed and heavily
manned ward and precinct organiza-
tions available to Democratic leaders
through COPE and local political pa-
tronage. In 25 cities with a population
of 25 million, the Republicans had
only 37 full-time paid workers. Of 34
city organizations responding to the
survey, 24 answered that even on
election day all their precincts had
not been fully manned in 1960; only
eighteen reported a full-time paid
executive officer of any kind; only
three a full-time paid finance official.
In 1960, only 1,100 of Philadelphia's
1,615 precincts were manned by the
Republican Party. Nixon received
31.9 per cent of the vote. A year
later, in the statewide race for the
state supreme court the number of
precincts manned climbed to 1,350.
The Republican candidate received
43.5 per cent. Better precinct work
contributed to the better showing.

The results of the findings of the
four subcommittees under Bliss and
their recommendations, including pro-
posed model organizations for a
city or county committee, full-time
professional staff, year-round precinct
organization, no matter how small, pre-
cinct training programs, and worker
recognition should be given wide at-
tention and application. For if the Re-
publicans develop organizations to an
effective level, much of the talk of
emulating the liberals in methods of
snaring the minority blocs will lose
whatever questionable appeal it has.
Bliss does not expect to win great
majorities in the cities. He is an articu-
late, practical realist. He does speak
of "narrowing the margin."
