**Henry Gets Polled**
by Raymond Moley

HENRY was planting some gera-
niums. It was a way of usefully
employing his body while his mind
was reaching a decision. Later there
would be two hours before bedtime.
At supper he had said he might go
over and discuss with a neighbor the
behavior of another neighbor's chick-
ens. There was also a report for the
office he had to work on. There was
also a good Western at 8:30. His wife
suggested the planting while he was
making up his mind.
The gate opened and a brisk young
man came in. He showed Henry a
card saying he was John Pollsum of
the Goofy Research Institute. He said:
"We are conducting a Presidential
opinion poll and would like to have
your cooperation." Henry nodded his
head reflectively.
Pollsum whipped out a notebook,
saying: "First I would like to have
your economic status, your social class
as it were."
Henry didn't understand.
"Your standing in society, in the
economic order."
"I guess all right. I don't make
any enemies."
After noting something in the book,
Pollsum went on: "What is your
party affiliation? Democratic, Repub-
lican, or independent?"
"Is there an independent party?
Who's running on that?"
"I don't mean that. I mean you,
for example."
"Oh! I don't want to run for any-
thing. They wouldn't like it at the
office. All that notoriety."
"I mean your preference."
"How on earth can I prefer it if it
isn't a party?"
"What party do you generally sup-
port at the polls?"
"I don't vote generally. Something's
always coming up. And I never really
kept track."
"Have you at any time voted
Democratic?"
"I voted for Roosevelt once. I
guess he was running against a fel-
low named London."
"Did you vote for Eisenhower?"
"Once. But he wasn't in a party. He
was like Washington or Lincoln."
"I'll put you down as an independ-
ent." Noting in book.
"I wouldn't want that to get out in
the office." Henry looked worried.
"Mr. Banks says our motto is all for
one and one for all. I don't want to
commit myself."
Pollsum handed Henry a larger
card. "Will you please mark your
preferences?"
Henry, reading aloud: "Kennedy
against Nixon. Johnson against Nixon.
Stevenson against Nixon. Humphrey
against Nixon. Symington against
Nixon. Why are all these fellows run-
ning against one man? Isn't that a
little unfair?"
Pollsum noted after "independent"
in his book: "Don't know." He said
"good-by" and moved toward the
gate and across the street.
Henry looked at his watch, slowly
entered the house, and turned on
the Western.

**MORAL OF THE STORY**

Henry isn't very sharp, but he and
other, smarter Henrys who fail to vote
are in the tens of millions. But none
is independent by intellectual convic-
tion, nor independent of interest in
what government is doing to him.
They have their homes, their savings,
their insurance, and their equity in
social security. They suffer from an
unsound dollar. They pay hundreds
of hidden taxes on what they buy.
They pay and they pray. They don't
consider themselves a problem. They
ask no pity or pious sentiment. They
work and save and invest, and keep
America productive and strong.
But pollsters and professional politi-
cal writers tell Republican candidates
that the Henrys are "independents"
and that the way to get them to vote
is to identify Republicanism with the
promises and policies of the liberal
Democratic-union labor-ADA coali-
tion. Thus they would forsake all oth-
ers, taking loyal party members for
granted and ending in "we happy
few." But 1940, 1944, and 1948 prove
that the greater the identification, the
greater will be the abstention.
Few Republican workers call on
Henry and explain what he has to
lose from profligate government. And
Democratic-union labor workers ig-
nore him because they consider him
hopelessly bourgeois.
Henry is forgotten. But he holds
the key to a creative, conservative
future for all of us.
