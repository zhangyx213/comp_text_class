**Looking Toward 1960**

by Raymond Moley

BERNARD M. BARUCH, that vener-
ated philosopher, tells a story de-
signed to comfort friends who fear
coming events. A man was con-
demned to die by a king. The wretch
proposed and the king agreed to call
off the execution if, within a year,
he was able to teach the king's horse
to fly. A friend said to the man that
he merely postponed the inevitable.
The answer was that the chances
were four to one in his favor: The
king might die. The man might die.
The horse might die. And he might
teach the horse to fly.

I am not introducing the sugges-
tion that any of the statesmen who
aspire to the Presidency may die be-
fore 1960, nor that horses will join
monkeys in space. I am merely sug-
gesting that there are unforeseen vi-
cissitudes in politics. But there are
undeniable facts before us which will
suffice for a number of observations.

Last year there was a great Demo-
cratic victory when the country was
just recovering from a recession. A
still greater contribution to Demo-
cratic success was the immense help
that Democratic candidates for Con-
gress and State Legislatures received
from the labor unions. Favorable spots
here and there were chosen by the
managers of AFL-CIO COPE. The
result was the attainment by these
unions of a workable majority in Con-
gress of Democrats whom they had
supported. Seven hundred seats in
State Legislatures were torn from Re-
publicans. The long-term aim of po-
litical labor, control of lawmaking, had
appreciably been attained.

**DEMOCRATIC FRUSTRATION**

But in 1960 business will be much
better than it was in 1958. The
Democratic-labor majority is already
confused, if not stymied, by the Presi-
dent's insistence on limiting deficits.
Also, the bright promises of ending
unemployment and business lethargy
by make-work spending have become
academic, since recovery has come
by other means. Opposition politicians
are finding that criticisms of the
Eisenhower-Dulles foreign policies
arouse little public interest. The man
in the street is merely confused by
talk of better methods of keeping the
peace. He is interested only in peace.

He has had it since 1953. Labor leg-
islation drafted by the unions' friends
in Congress has backfired. Neither
the union leaders nor management is
satisfied. At the end of this ses-
sion, the Democratic majority may
conclude that "the harvest is past,
the summer is ended, and we are
not saved."

Moreover, the 1960 election will be
decided not alone by issues, but by
the quality of candidates and espe-
cially by organization. The stark fact,
admitted privately by some Demo-
crats, is that their crop of candidates
is not of the first grade. No standout
appears among the four Senatorial
aspirants. Three lack experience. Two
will be questioned about health by
an electorate with memories of White
House illnesses. All have politi-
cal handicaps. The weakness of
these offerings reveals itself in the
growing talk about a twice-defeated
Adlai Stevenson. In a recently pub-
lished poll of California Democrats,
Stevenson ran ahead of Kennedy.

**A DIFFERENT PATTERN**

On the Republican side, the public
polls show a widening margin for
Nixon over Rockefeller. Strong indi-
cations, together with unpublicized
evidence, show that Rockefeller could
not win again against ex-Governor
Harriman. Barring any disaster, Nixon
is likely to be nominated. If so, he will
be a most accomplished political
leader and tireless campaigner. He
will have the great advantage of
White House experience over any pos-
sible opponent.

So far as labor-union help is con-
cerned, it must be remembered that
the AFL-CIO COPE was created to
elect members of Congress and state
legislators, not Presidents. Its strategy
is to thrust overwhelming strength into
selected districts and communities. It
cannot afford to dissipate its limited
strength over a national campaign.

Moreover, in a Presidential cam-
paign voters approach the polls in a
quite different mood than in local
contests. More laggard Republicans
and conservatives turn out.

These are very important factors
which are overlooked by those who
believe that the pattern of 1960 will
resemble that of 1958.
