**PROPERTY TAX REFORM**

**BY RAYMOND MOLEY**

T he income tax has so monopolized
public attention that, until re-
cently, the property tax has been
noted only as a local or personal is-
sue. But this tax yields approximately
$23 billion, which about equals the
yield of the corporation income tax.
And without the property tax, the in-
come tax would become an insupport-
able burden.

The property tax, with its inequi-
ties and its mode of collection,
touches substantially every business
and millions and millions of homeown-
ers and tenants. Its reform thus be-
comes a great national problem which
only recently has been publicly rec-
ognized and commented upon.

At the root of the operation of the
property tax is the assessor. But his
office, a political plum tree, generally
operates under antiquated and unfair
laws and methods.

A year ago in Claremont, Calif., I
attended a conference of assessors of
a number of American communities
who exchanged views about the im-
provement of their work with several
of their counterparts (valuers) from
Australia and New Zealand, where
assessment is highly professionalized.
What emerged was the critical need
in the United States for reform in the
method of selecting assessors, in the
rules and laws under which they op-
erate and in the qualifications for the
chiefs and their staffs.

**CORRUPTION**

It is a deplorable commentary on
our civilization that the need for re-
form is seldom recognized until scan-
dal and crime are unearthed. This
awakening has recently come to three
California cities.

The need for revenue for San
Francisco, Oakland and San Diego
suddenly threw the light upon the
county assessors there. Grave irregu-
larities were revealed and published
in the press. The assessors in San
Francisco and Alameda counties
were indicted and convicted. The
death of the assessor in San Diego
brought about a change in the office.
The major charge was wholesale brib-
ery. Before all this happened, a new
assessor in Los Angeles, Philip Wat-
son, had instituted fundamental re-
forms, and his office is recognized as
competent and clean.

In California, as in many other
states, assessors are elected. This in-
troduces politics and with it some of
its familiar evils. For the assessor has
such potential over taxpayers that
the temptations are very great to
show favoritism at a price.

The best opinion is that assessors
should be appointed, perhaps by a
bipartisan state board, that high qual-
ifications should be imposed and that
their staffs should be up to civil-serv-
ice standards.

A second reform should be the
imposition, by law and practice, of
standard valuations on all property at
a specified percentage of the market
value and subject to constant review.

**HIGHER LAND ASSESSMENTS**

But a still more basic reform should
be a correction of the present dis-
parity in the valuation of building im-
provements and of land.

In San Francisco the Arthur D.
Little consulting firm was recently
employed by the City Planning Com-
mission to study property-tax policies.
A major feature of its report was the
disparity between the tax burden
upon land on the one hand and im-
provements on the other. It pointed
out that over a period of ten years
the assessed valuation of the land
had actually dropped from 30 to 25
per cent. "Thus, the burden of taxa-
tion has been falling more heavily on
improvements on the land than on
the land itself. With this trend and
the threat of a growing tax rate, own-
ers will be reluctant to improve their
property, lest the increase in taxes
nullify the benefits of the improve-
ments ... Furthermore, the disparity
in assessed value between new and
old buildings selling at the same price
discourages new construction and the
replacement of old buildings."

This verdict today confirms what
was said by David Ricardo, the great
British economist, a century and a
half ago. He said that what is good
for the landowner is bad for every
other element in the economy.

Moreover, a land tax is almost com-
pletely shielded from corruption.
Sit on the land. Don't improve your
property, and you will profit. But
build and improve, and the tax gath-
erer will pounce upon you as if you
were an enemy of the republic.
