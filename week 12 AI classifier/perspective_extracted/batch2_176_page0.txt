**Nixon's Anti-Communism**

*by Raymond Moley*

LOS ANGELES—I find it difficult to believe that this is the same state I visited when Richard Nixon was running for the United States Senate in 1950. For at that time he was under bitter fire from liberals, on the ground that he was an extreme anti-Communist. Now, in 1962, the extreme anti-Communists are bitterly attacking him because of his alleged lack of sympathy for their cause. At the same time the liberals still harbor their 1950 antipathies.

What has happened to cause this amazing change? Is there any evidence to show that in the intervening years Nixon has been soft toward the Communist threat?

In 1953 the Vice President traveled extensively in East Asia. On his return he submitted a memorandum pointing out the Communist threat to Southeast Asia and Japan. He quoted with approval a leader in what was then Indochina, who said: "If we divide it we will lose; if we invite the enemy into a conference we will lose." We did divide it, and now we have all but lost the pieces. We have been conferring fruitlessly for eight years and now beat a retreat from Laos under the guise of a coalition.

In April 1954 Nixon said at a meeting of newspaper publishers that if it proved necessary "to put American boys in" to prevent Communist expansion in Indochina, he personally favored such a risk. This brought down upon him a blast of criticism. But at long last the boys are there.

**PROPHETIC REPORT**

But this 1954 statement was all he could do as a loyal member of the Administration in power. The hundreds of millions of wasted money and the inexorable creeping of Communist power represent the failure of eight years of efforts by that Administration and the one which followed.

In 1954 Nixon carried the burden of the Republican campaign and was singled out for attack by the liberals who remembered 1950. And Republican liberals tried to keep him off the national ticket in 1956.

In 1958 he traveled in Latin America. The Communists there marked him as their deadly enemy and planned violence and hostile demonstrations well before he came. His forceful talk to Khrushchev in Moscow needs no elaboration.

In 1959 Castro visited the United States, still shamming as an agrarian reformer. Nixon had a long conference with him which he described in a confidential memorandum for the Administration. He said that Castro was a dictator in the Communist pattern who was either utterly naïve or "subject to Communist discipline."

The State Department, which had permitted—even assisted—the rise of Castro, was apparently not impressed. Thus, Nixon fought in the Eisenhower Administration to show the reality and danger of Communism.

**THE EXTREMISTS**

But in the course of those years Robert Welch created his Birch Society and vilified Eisenhower and Nixon. He saw appeasement in every chimney corner. Since Nixon regarded such vituperation as positively harmful to the anti-Communist cause, he denounced it. This brought about the attacks to which he is subjected now.

He has opposed an anti-Communist constitutional amendment not because he lacks sympathy for its purpose, but because it is badly drawn and would not prove effective. Also, he has refused to attack a fellow Republican in the primary. For these three positions he may lose votes. But to take them required real courage.

But if Nixon should recount this record, he would invite attack from Governor Brown and the liberals who are saying that only state issues are involved in this contest for the governorship and, by implication, that the immense state of California has no interest in what happens in Southeast Asia and Cuba.

An utterly fantastic detail of this campaign is the appearance of Earl Warren's son among Nixon's enemies, although in so doing he is really helping the extremists who are calling for the impeachment of his father. This is often the lot of a moderate who seeks rational and legal ends. He becomes the center of attack from both extremes. In a political campaign, as in war, the voice of reason is stilled. The extremists command the rostrum and get the headlines.
