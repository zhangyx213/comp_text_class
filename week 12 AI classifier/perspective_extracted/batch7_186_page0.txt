**Long Forever on the Throne**

**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

NEW ORLEANS—There were sad faces
on good citizens in New Orleans
the day after the first primary, in which
the governorship of the state was the
chief issue. Hour after hour, the plurality
of Earl Long mounted over the three
candidates who were running against
him. Finally, it passed the mark set in
two previous attempts by this brother
of the late Kingfish to win the office
upon which a dictatorship
was established in this American
state. People said sadly:
"Well, maybe people don't
want good government." The
answer to this might be that
people do want good government, if politicians could find
out what they mean by good
government and learn how to
make it attractive to them.
Running against Long was
Sam Houston Jones. Jones was elected
as a reform governor in 1940 and was
succeeded by Jimmie Davis, whom he
supported in 1944.
Also running was Judge Robert F.
Kennon, who comes from a small town
and has a creditable record.
Finally, there was Congressman James
H. Morrison, who won attention some
years ago by an incredible trick of
imitating the oratorical style of the
late Kingfish.


LONG has never wavered in his determination to win the governorship
since the death of his brother. He ran
first in the initial primaries in 1940 and
1944 but lost both times in the run-off.
This time, he has a good chance of
breezing through. This will mean the
restoration of Long rule—perhaps for a
considerable period, because Earl has
some of the ability and all of the daring
that were Huey's. Even those who opposed
him concede that he conducted
this campaign with great skill. His appeal
was, of course, in the rural parishes.
His publicity was marked by a shrewd
appreciation of the essential differences
in appealing to city and to country
folks. He freely promised whatever
benefits and bonanzas elicit the hankering
of voters. He capitalized on the
fact that Jones is a corporation lawyer
and a member of a social stratum that
is envied but resented. And, as a major
weapon, he induced the son of the late
Huey to campaign for and with him.
It was important to Earl Long to
bring his brother's son into the campaign because of rumors spread by his
enemies that he had at last broken with
the Kingfish. The young man had a good
record at the university, is a lawyer and
has some of his father's ability. It is
believed that, should Earl be elected,
this son of Huey would be groomed to
succeed him. Thus, the Long dynasty
casts a shadow into the distant future.
It should be added that
the Long campaign seems to
have been endowed with
plenty of money, which is always
potent
The Jones campaign was
perhaps a little too slick and
citified. Certainly, it failed to
recognize that totally different
appeals are required in
city and rural districts in
Louisiana. It has also been
suggested by some observers that the
Jones group suffered from overconfidence. And, as it proved, the support of
Governor Davis and Mayor Morrison
did not help Jones.
If the late returns put Judge Kennon
in second place, many people believe he
will have a better chance than would
Jones to beat Long in the run-off on
Feb. 24. Kennon is a fresh, new figure
in state politics here. He ran much better
than had been expected. Moreover,
the accumulated discontents with the
reform regime would not fall upon him.
And all of the anti-Long force would be
gathered in one movement. In a Long-
Jones run-off, not all of the Kennon
vote would go to Jones, while practically all of the Morrison vote would
go to Long.


THE only hope seems to be to summon all the crusading zeal that
elected reform in 1940. That means getting out the big stay-at-home vote
which failed to appear in the recent primary. Maybe this can be done. Years
have passed now since the scandals of
the old regime broke in the face of this
state. People forget, and thousands of
new voters are too young to realize how
bad was the government of the Long
machine.
It looks dark for good government in
Louisiana. And if the spirit of Huey
Long should again reign at Baton
Rouge, lazy citizens in the comfort of
their homes will have nobody but themselves to blame.
