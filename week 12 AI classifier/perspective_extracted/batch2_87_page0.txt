**PERSPECTIVE**

**How Democracy Democs**

**by Raymond Moley**

A BRIGHT-EYED reformer in the Progressive era 55 years ago said that the direct vote of the people was necessary if democracy were properly “to democ.” Three months ago I wrote a piece deploring the whole system of Presidential primaries, and, in particular, its practice in New Hampshire. Thereafter, various statesmen and a stateswoman rushed up there, proving how silly this system is. We are now witnessing the unfolding of the comedy. So many candidates are entered and so many others will be subject to write-in votes. The result will prove nothing.

Meanwhile, a number of useful public servants neglect the jobs for which they were chosen and in which they have attained distinction. They spend endless days speaking to small handfuls of shivering natives up and down the snow-clad state. We get glimpses of them in the press reports —eating ice cream with wide-eyed children, pizzas in the city streets, and chicken and dumplings in women’s clubs; arguing with teenagers, and shaking innumerable frosty hands. To report this nonsense many good newsmen are sent up there who might be better employed digging out the facts in the Baker case or the messes in Vietnam and Panama.


**HOW IT HAPPENED**

Many rational Americans wonder, first, how and why New Hampshire Yankees adopted the Presidential primary and, second, why it comes so early that candidates must campaign in such abominable winter weather. My researches reveal this: In those quiet pastoral years before 1908 New Hampshire was ruled by the president of the Boston & Maine Railroad, who sat in his office in Boston’s North Station. His operator in New Hampshire carried out his orders. This story is told in thinly disguised fictional form in the fine novel “Coniston,” written by New Hampshire’s Winston Churchill. Eastern reformers heard about La Follette’s Presidential primary system in Wisconsin and mounted a movement to have it adopted in New Hampshire. In 1908 George Moses, later a U.S. senator, was selected as a delegate to the Republican con-

vention, pledged to William H. Taft. But he broke his pledge and voted for Charles W. Fairbanks. Thereupon the legislature adopted the system which is now in operation.

The reason the voting was fixed for a date in March was Yankee thrift. That is town meeting day, when it is solemnly decided to prohibit bicycle riding on the sidewalks, to paint the town hall, and select town officials. I surmise that the town meeting is held then because it is just before the sap begins to rise in the maples. I hope I shall be pardoned if I suggest that the campaigning which precedes that day causes the saps to rise all over the Republic to learn what one-third of 1 percent of the population of the nation has to say about who should be the next President of the United States.


**COSTLY AND TRICKY**

The ancient rule of the Boston & Maine was measurably costly. But the primary system costs much more money to the candidates. A veteran of the state’s political wars has told me that the cost used to be $1 a vote. Now, with inflation and the war on poverty, it must cost several times that. In New Hampshire, as elsewhere in the nation, this sort of democracy can, as we have seen in recent years, give the majority to the man with the fattest bankroll. There can be clever tricks under this system. In 1932 the Democratic contestants were FDR and Alfred E. Smith. Roosevelt’s managers filed the names of only twelve delegate-candidates. Then, to scatter the Smith votes, those Roosevelt managers added Roosevelt men to the list of Smith candidates, making twenty in all. FDR’s slate won and a Presidential career was in the making.

As winter yields to spring we shall see this comedy repeated in several other states. It should be obvious that whoever seeks a Presidential nomination by this route must have not only unlimited money but the physical constitution of an itinerant professional wrestler. This is Presidential primary democracy in practice. I am inclined to believe that it is no improvement over the benign despotism of the Boston & Maine.
