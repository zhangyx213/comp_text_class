**Politics Plays With Fire**
**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

In Gerald Johnson's spirited book on Andrew Jackson, a hilarious story is told of a foot race in which the young and frail Jackson had a giant competitor. The agreement provided that Jackson run twice as far as his opponent. The giant, however, was required to carry a man on his back. No one suffered in the competition but the unfortunate rider, who was almost squeezed to death by the excited giant.

In the present political contest in Washington, the Republicans have farther to go, but Truman must carry the financial structure as he runs. And it looks now as if the country generally is due to be the chief sufferer in the race.

The Truman message and budget set up a shining panorama of promises. He cannot seriously suggest that these promises can or should be fulfilled. They are set up as targets for Republicans to shoot at. They are, moreover, chunks torn from Henry Wallace's prospective platform.

Time was when a third party was permitted to run at least once before the major parties made away with its issues. The Democrats in 1896 boldly lifted the essentials from the Populists of 1892. Wilson in his first term took over all the vital proposals of the Progressives of 1912. But now, apparently, the Wallace issues are to be grabbed before he has a chance to have a convention. The infant is stolen from the delivery room.

In his budget message the President said, in effect: I believe we can halt inflation and I am going to try. But this budget is based on the assumption that I shall fail. It is also based on the assumption that inflation will get worse, because I plan to raise additional dollars on the corporation tax, which is a tax on profits.

If the President's budget were to be enacted, we would be all set for the most exciting joy ride in our history. Also, we are about to have the most expensive election in the world's history, since the Republicans can hardly afford to cut expenses as they should, in fact, be cut.

One of the dangers in this situation is illustrated by the proposal to raise additional money by corporation taxes. Since corporation profits are marginal, their size shrinks relatively much faster than prices or the volume of business. And since taxes are a bite taken out of profits, their yield also declines relatively faster than prices or volume. Hence, if this budget were enacted, even a minor hesitation in business in the next eighteen months would cover the Federal financial picture with a smear of red ink.

Evidently the President is listening to a group of economic advisers who believe that inflation and deflation can be regulated like an automatic machine. And these advisers are not, in the main, his Cabinet, who are generally sound and quite aware of the dangers and limitations of controls. In his economic report, the President says, "our second main objective for 1948 should be... to stop the inflationary spiral without producing cutbacks or extensive unemployment." He thus admits the risk, but he invites Congress to take it. He probably means he is willing to settle for the present level, which is, of course, higher than prewar. His policy resembles that of the "indiscreet" movie senator, who was for neither inflation nor deflation, but for "flation."

The question is whether a combination of deflationary and inflationary measures such as the President proposes can be nicely balanced. There is also a question whether any equilibrium can be reached while the budget is on a $40,000,000,000 plateau.

While the government can invoke many legal controls, it cannot control the behavior of people who still have some freedom of choice. The people who do not want inflation are numerous but unorganized. They are, among others, pensioners, landlords, people who live on invested capital and life-insurance companies. Their individual reactions can be serious, however unorganized. The fear of an uncertain interest rate causes insurance companies to hesitate. That affects new securities issues. Thus, a chain reaction is set up that leads to a point which no one can foresee and no government can reach.

This political contest may produce a situation which no party, however victorious, will want to meet in 1949.
