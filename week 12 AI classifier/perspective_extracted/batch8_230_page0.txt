Once upon a time, there was an
appropriate vocabulary for economic dis-
cussion, another for legal documents and
still another for political discourse. But
that was in the old days, and things have
changed, you know. Now the pronounce-
ments from Washington indicate that we
have a new language—or, rather, a new
jargon the lawyers, politicians and sociolo-
gists have whipped up in their spare time
—a jargon not apparently designed to
make the actions of the Administration
intelligible to itself, but to make its actions
unintelligible to anyone else.

This interesting experiment seems to
have been inspired by Mr. Thurman Ar-
nold of the Department of Justice, a home-
spun philosopher who has written a book.
Mr. Arnold's book pointed out that many
of those principles we regard as funda-
mental are actually parts of a folklore, cre-
ated by selfish people to protect a selfish
order of things. It said, further, that some
of our words are symbols of facts that
have ceased to exist. And these truisms
seem to have burst upon the Washington
politico-intellectuals with the force of di-
vine revelation. At any rate, their restate-
ment at a time when rationalizations were
sorely needed to explain away a number of
Administration policies gone haywire
began the process of undermining the in-
tegrity of words and concepts by changing
their definitions.

"Radicals" have become "conserva-
tives." "Government spending" is the pru-
dent business of "investing" for future
monetary returns. A legal guarantee of
minimum wages is a guarantee of in-
creased consumer purchasing power. The
risk takers of industry are the gamblers on
the future (which isn't so far-fetched these
days). From money already borrowed and
spent will come a bigger income in the fu-
ture because our "national income will be
greater tomorrow than it is today."

Deficits, in any case, are not an evil to
be shunned, according to this hocus-pocus,
but a blessing to be embraced. For the
only basis of prosperity is government "in-
vestment" great enough to lift the national
income to a point which will make tax
receipts cover the new level of expendi-
ture, or "investment." When our national
income is $80,000,000,000, the income from
present taxes will be great enough to meet
the outlays. And that, in itself, is part of
the proof that our national income will be


$80,000,000,000. There is, of course, no
suspicion that the inability to balance the
budget, or even to turn in the direction of
balancing the budget, has anything to do
with the inability to induce "gamblers"
upon the future to hire people at statutory
minimum wages, when these people are al-
ready at work for the government at the
same wages.

The point is, you see, that under the
new dispensation the expenditures for soil
conservation, education, public health, bat-
tleships, lighthouses and the like are "as-
sets." Not operating expenses, but assets.
Not even intangible assets which return
dividends in social benefit or esthetic
pleasure, but assets which will presumably
return dividends in cash or in taxable ca-
pacity. The expenditure you made for the
food you ate last night is an asset: it per-
manently increased your ability to pay
your running expenses; and who knows but
what you might be able to borrow money
against your receipted bill from the gro-
cer's and butcher's.

The breadth of the Administration's
imagination goes even further on this ques-
tion of "investments." "A large (italics
mine) part of the government debt is off-
set by debts owed to the government—
loans of many kinds made on a business
basis by the RFC and the Farm Credit
Administration, for instance, and are now
being repaid on schedule," the President
told the American Retail Federation the
other evening. These are loans to private
enterprise—some of them loans which
bankers had refused to make, some of
them loans which the government's bank
examiners were ordering out of the banks,
and some of them loans which the govern-
ment made for broad social and economic
reasons with no wholehearted expectation
of repayment in full. When they got into
the government's hands they all became
business loans, and now we are informed
they are being paid on schedule. It would
be rude to ask to see the schedule—say, of
the rate of repayment of the loans made
directly by the Federal Reserve banks.
For these are loans which are assets "just
as sound as the loans made by the bankers
of the country." And that which was un-
sound in private hands, which brought
about overproduction, which "created a
surplus of goods overhanging the market,"
which lowered our national income to 39
billions in 1932, becomes sound when the
government does it. Private enterprise's
"overproduction" is government's "provid-
ing work for our capital and our people."
Besides, as the President put it, "our

national debt, after all, is an internal debt
owed not only by the nation, but to the
nation. If our children have to pay interest
on it, they will pay that interest to
themselves." I don't know about all chil-
dren, but mine will not look at it that way.
I doubt that, as individuals, future citi-
zens of the United States will feel that
when they pay taxes to the Federal gov-
ernment, taxes which will be paid out in
interest on bonds held by other citizens,
they are paying the money to themselves.
And even citizens of the United States are
individuals. It is unlikely that they will
feel that the money they pay, they have.
They will probably think just as we do
about it. Dryden once said:

As long as words a different sense will
bear,
And each may be his own interpreter,
Our airy faith will no foundation find,
The word's a weathercock for every
wind.

The pattern of thought on which a
civilization like ours is based is a strong
and enduring fabric. Despite the attempt
to create new word-worlds, the amount of
change that can be achieved in fifty years
is relatively small. "Words," Francis Ba-
con put it, "are the tokens current and ac-
cepted for conceits, as monies are for
values." And people like to be hornswog-
gled as little by word juggling as they do
by money juggling.

When, for example, in connection with
some of the antitrust cases that are under
consideration by the Department of Jus-
tice, businessmen were told that the indict-
ments brought against them did not reflect
any personal blame but were merely prepa-
rations for consent decrees which would set
up new principles of business enterprise,
these businessmen were highly indignant
in many cases. They said that no matter
what a lawyer in Washington told them
about the meaning of a criminal suit, in
the world in which they lived the words
"criminal" and "indictment" had bad con-
notations. They said further that they
would not want to be called "criminals"
even in the interest of a noble experiment.
And no amount of rationalization by the
word experts was able to batter down this
settled conviction.

Nor, I judge, will any amount of verbal
legerdemain convince the public that the
nation can be made prosperous by increas-
ing the amount the government spends or
induce private investors (or gamblers) to
take their savings and put them into pro-
ductive enterprise until they believe the
hard facts justify the risks they must take.

Meanwhile the merry game of
changing labels for things goes on, fooling
few really, except those who play it, since
words are hardly a substitute for recovery,
even in "a new moral climate."
