**PERSPECTIVE**

**Money for the Parties**

by Raymond Moley

SENATOR Goldwater, in the correspondence which we have exchanged concerning the new National Republican Citizens Committee, quite reasonably stresses the point that such citizens' organizations raise money that should go to the party. In the past this has been a source of friction between the parties and volunteer groups.

The senator suggests that the committee created at Gettysburg should contribute to the liquidation of the indebtedness which the Republican National Committee carried over from the 1960 Presidential campaign. That is a valid suggestion. Also, in forming auxiliary groups in large urban centers, which is a main purpose of the Citizens Committee, it should be a rule that such groups should assist the regular party organization in money raising. Moreover, such groups could perform indispensable but costly services for the legally constituted local party organizations. These services should include mobilizing and training volunteers, publishing publicity material for the party and its candidates, organizing public meetings, and conducting continuous research. Such activities are the major concern of the Republican Associates of Los Angeles.

In performing such services, citizens' groups should accord full recognition to the regular party leaders. The regulars should take the bows and reap the benefits of publicity. For if there are laurels to be bestowed in the arid field of politics, they should go to these hardy perennials who have labored indefatigably in years of defeat and neglect.

**A WAY TO AGREE**

The enactment of legislation by Congress directed at rationalizing the methods of collecting funds for both major political parties would be an excellent means of cooperation among the new National Republican Citizens Committee, the Republican National Committee, the Republican Congressional Committee, the Republican Joint Leadership, and the Senatorial Campaign Committee, of which Senator Goldwater is chairman.

President Kennedy opened the way for such bipartisan legislation in presenting the report of a study committee in April. It is recognized in both parties that there is need for improving the method of financing campaigns for Federal offices. The Kennedy proposal is to provide certain tax advantages for contributors. But the President spoke only of Presidential campaigns. The plan should also apply to Congressional elections.

A fair and workable plan would be to allow an income-tax credit of $10 for each individual who contributes as much as $20, and a deduction from taxable income for larger contributions of, say, $3,000. The two national committees should be responsible for collecting the contributions and for reporting thereon to the government. Each contributor should have a receipt to attach to his income-tax return. The loss in Federal revenue would not be great. Perhaps it would not exceed $20 million. Certainly, if we are justified in spending billions in spreading free institutions throughout the world, this is not too much to allow for keeping our own two-party institutions healthy.

**WIDER SUPPORT**

There is now great competition and confusion in fund-raising. The parties are reduced to all sorts of undesirable methods. Some of these involve obligations to a multitude of special interests who now give in the belief that they are buying some advantage or protection.

The method suggested above would still place the burden on the parties and candidates to solicit subscriptions. But the task would be vastly easier.

Finally, with such tax advantages there would be many more large and small supporters of the parties. When an individual has contributed to the party of his choice, he is more likely to take an interest in elections, to work for the party's success, to vote, and to get others to vote. The two parties would operate on much wider bases.

It seems to me that much of the fear among organization Republicans that the new Citizens Committee would pre-empt money that might otherwise go to the party would be removed by such legislation. For the national party committees would then have a built-in legal advantage over volunteer groups.
