Thomas E. Truman and Harry S. Dewey

by RAYMOND MOLEY

THERE were people who said during
the late Presidential campaign that
on broad economic policy Truman and
Dewey seemed to be reading from the
same book. Without agreeing with
that view, it can be said that the cur-
rent budget plans of the President
and of the governor of New York are
cut in the same economic pattern.
Both recommend record spending.
Both want higher taxes.
Both seem to believe that
government can better plan
the flow of capital into per-
manent plant and improve-
ments than can individual
enterprise. And both betray
a hazy view of the econom-
ic future by recommending
at once programs of de-
flation and inflation.

It may be added that
both statesmen are facing party revolts.
In last year's campaign it seemed to
be taken for granted that inflation
rather than deflation was the real
threat. Even now, both the Truman
and the Dewey budgets recommend a
heavy fiscal attack on inflationary
trends by recommending the virtual
sterilization of a large amount of the
taxpayer's money.

TRUMAN asks tax increases to pro-
vide an additional $4,000,000,000
in general income and $1,700,000,000
in social-security funds. The money
thus exacted from the taxpayer would
largely be sterilized so far as purchas-
ing power and risk capital are con-
cerned. And since the greater part of
the new tax money would come from
corporations, it would greatly reduce
active productive capital. This would
be exceedingly deflationary.

A major factor in Dewey's proposals
would also be seriously deflationary.
This requires a bit of explanation, too.
During the war years New York,
like other states, acquired a large treas-
ury surplus, which Dewey wisely pre-
vailed upon the legislature to set up
as a postwar reconstruction fund. A
part of this fund has been spent, but
the remainder is about $340,000,000,
of which over $200,000,000 is not
under contract or planned for any
specific use. In his current budget
Dewey asks that something more than
$70,000,000 from increased taxes be
added to this fund. This would be put
away for some future use not yet de-
termined. In all, he proposes a tax in-
crease of $168,000,000, a dreary bur-
den on the taxpayers of a state which
also bears a heavy proportion of Fed-
eral taxes.

As in the case of the Truman tax
hikes, this Dewey bite would take
from current purchasing power and
venture capital a large sum which
would lie away, semisteri-
lized, waiting for some fu-
ture depression when public
works would be useful in
keeping up employment.

These Dewey-Truman ad-
ventures in sterilization
would have been wise two
or three years ago. But to-
day every economic index
shows that the country has
passed the inflationary peak,
that the boom is leveling off, and that
some deflation is in prospect. There-
fore, these joint Dewey-Truman blows
would accelerate the rate of decline
to an extent which no one can now
determine.

Both budgets, however, contain
broad trends toward immediate new
spending. Thus, both budgets look
both to inflation and to deflation. Both
assume that the business cycle can be
controlled by government. Both em-
brace the Keynes theory of spending,
but, at least in the case of Truman's
budget, there is neglected the Keynes
warning that spending be curtailed
in prosperous times.

STABILIZATION is certainly desirable,
but a wise middle ground is not
attained when inflation and deflation
are accelerated at the same time.
Prudent government policy would em-
body the elimination of waste, the en-
couragement of venture capital, and,
at a moment like this, with so much
uncertainty beclouding the future, a
measurable assurance that there would
be no increase in the tax burden.
Individual planning for the future
cannot exist when government takes
the means of spending and investment
into its own hands. Both Truman and
Dewey are taking the Papa-knows-
best attitude. But apparently Papa isn't
quite sure of anything except that the
individual use of the money the indi-
vidual earns should be sharply cur-
tailed.
