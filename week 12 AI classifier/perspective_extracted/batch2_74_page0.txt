**PERSPECTIVE**

**A PRESIDENT'S SAFETY**

**BY RAYMOND MOLEY**

Whatever may be our attitude toward the major policies of Lyndon B. Johnson, almost everyone believes he is trying to be a good and useful President. And for half a year he has been an unusual President. He has brought Americans closer to him and himself closer to them than could ever have been the destiny of his predecessor.

The intimacy which people feel toward the towering figure in whose hands rests so much of their destiny is a long established human fact. His activities become a part of their daily life. Their eyes are upon him. He has a firm grip on the nation's ear-or as beagle lovers might say-the nation's ears.

For this reason, and because the man is so generally liked and also because of the personal tragedies and dangers which have attended Presidents in our time and in the past, there is considerable concern among Americans about this President's safety and health. This concern naturally becomes a subject of fair comment, not because this happens to be an election year, for it prevails in all years and at all times. A President's care for his health and safety ceases to be a matter of personal choice. This vests a responsibility upon him as great as the terms of his constitutional oath.

**FATALISM**

In the light of this, Mr. Johnson as well as many other Americans might well read and reflect upon the historical realities revealed in a book published in 1960 by Dr. Rudolph Marx, "The Health of the Presidents." This book is not designed to be alarmist or morbid. It is a carefully selected collection of historical and medical facts. Conclusions are left to be drawn by the reader.

One conclusion I have drawn after reading the book twice is that a certain fatalism grips Presidents. This was brought home to me once when I was in an open car with FDR driving through the crowded traffic in Washington. The Secret Service officers up ahead had waved all occupied cars to the curb and of necessity the President's car had to pass close to them. This brought to my mind a night in Miami when I saw Roosevelt as President-elect heedlessly expose himself in an open car to the murderous fire of Zangara. A woman's hand deflected the assassin's fire to Anton Cermak and others near Roosevelt at the time.

I remarked that this was an open invitation to danger. The President said: "Anyone can shoot a President. All that can be done is to see that no assassin escapes."

**LESSONS FROM HISTORY**

Abraham Lincoln, until the last months of his life, had a habit of walking by night or day through the streets of Washington, usually alone. On one occasion when he was returning in the dark from the Soldiers' Home on horseback, someone knocked off his top hat with a bullet. Previous to the night at Ford's Theater, Lincoln had sent his bodyguard to Richmond on a secret mission. No one was on guard at the theater but one man who left his post in the passage to the President's box. Unobserved, Booth walked through an unlocked door to his victim.

A man named Guitteau had made his efforts to see President Garfield so persistent that he was specifically denied entrance to the White House. On his way to a holiday, Garfield went to the railway station and walked through the waiting room toward his train. Only one policeman was present and Guitteau walked to within a few feet of the President and fired the fatal shots.

My interest in the subject of this piece was first awakened when, as a boy of 15, I was in a building next to the Temple of Music at the Buffalo Exposition on Sept. 7, 1901. George B. Cortelyou had twice canceled a plan for a handshaking reception for McKinley. Twice McKinley reinstated the plan, saying: "No one would want to hurt me." There were plenty of guards, in fact so many that in the press of the crowd, real security was impossible. There was a rule, too, that no one should approach the President with his hands covered. But Czolgosz, the assassin, was permitted to extend a bandaged hand.

Former President Truman no doubt was aware of these historical facts when he spoke a word of warning to LBJ three weeks ago.
