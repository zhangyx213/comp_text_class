The CIO vs. the State of Ohio
by Raymond Moley

ONCE more, as in Taft’s campaign
for the Senate in 1950, the state
of Ohio is the scene of a bitter battle
in the labor bosses’ war for the political
and economic domination of the
nation. This fight means much more to
us all than speculation about the Presidential
aspirations of a lot of fellows
named Joe. It concerns not who is to
hold office for a term or two, but who
is to make the laws under
which we shall live in the
long future.

Fresh from its victory
over Ford and GM, Walter
Reuther’s UAW-CIO attempted
to force the legislature
of Ohio to pass a law
which would not only legalize
the payment by the
automobile companies of
supplementary compensation,
but would increase the maximum
unemployment compensation from
$30 weekly for 26 weeks to $59 for
39 weeks, a rate equaled among the
states only by Nevada. It would have
added something like $47 million to
the state’s unemployment payments.
It would have raised the state unemployment
benefit to 60 per cent of the
wages, thus lifting from the Ford company
(for example) all but 5 per cent
of its obligation under its contract in
the first four weeks.

Governor Lausche characterized
this demand as “fantastic,” and the
legislature asserted its constitutional
responsibility by writing its own law.
It raised the Ohio rate to a figure
which ranks Ohio fourth among the
states of the union.

The CIO thereupon used the Ohio
Initiative and Referendum law to put
on the November ballot its proposal
which the legislature had rejected.
More important to the CIO than the
greatly increased payments by the
state is the provision in the proposal
which would legalize the payment of
supplementary compensation without
deducting such payments from the
state’s share. To win this change in
the law in Ohio is vital to the consummation
of Reuther’s guaranteed annual
wage. For the contracts with the
companies provide that before the
companies begin their payments,
there must be this change in the law
or executive rulings in states in which
two thirds of the affected workers are
located. Michigan, already accounted
for, has 56 per cent, and Ohio 11 per
cent. Thus, if the drive on Ohio should
fail, the CIO would have to win at
least two other states by June 1, 1957,
or the GAW plan terminates.

This contest raises these deeply
significant issues of political and economic
principle:

1—If the CIO wins this contest, it
means that a shotgun agreement
between a powerful
union and a few companies
pushes aside and supplants
a pattern of law established
after long and careful consideration
by the constitutional and
responsible government of a state. Also,
if Ohio is won, the CIO will
impose its will upon other
industrial states. Thus a
nation already dependent, so far as
price is concerned, for its means of
transportation upon private agreements
between a mighty union and a
few companies, is threatened with the
imposition of laws written by Reuther’s
lawyers and enforced by stooges
elected by the political machines of
labor bosses.

2—This means that, with Michigan
already securely in its grip, the CIO
would gain another great industrial
state and thus acquire the mobilized
power to march on into other states.
For the Reuther formula is first to win
over company after company and then
translate economic power into
political domination of state after
state. This is the European concept
of the strategic minority.

3—This contest, if won, would
demonstrate how a vast interstate private
interest with immense campaign
funds can invade individual states and
control their elections.

4—On the economic side, it would
mean that an unemployed person
would under this plan receive more
for not working than the legally established
minimum wage, plus exemption
from income tax.

5—The proposal is highly discriminatory.
A million workers, at least,
would be denied this benefit but
would contribute through higher
prices to others. An entire state would
be subject to a levy for a minority
which happens to have interstate
power and money behind it.
