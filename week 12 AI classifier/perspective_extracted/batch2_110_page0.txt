**PERSPECTIVE**

**Pork and the President**

by Raymond Moley

DON'T let anyone tell you that the
President has no responsibility
for the billions of pork-barrel money
now being spent on wasteful and unnecessary projects. Many of these
were vividly displayed in *Life* magazine under date of Aug. 16. This was
a fine example of the service of the
Fourth Estate at its best.

Back in those quiet pastoral years
before World War I we had our
first Billion Dollar Congress. It was
pointed out then that the excessive
cost of government was largely due
to pork-barrel legislation, mostly in
the omnibus Rivers and Harbors bills.
Wise people at that time said that
such spending could be checked by
an executive budget based upon national interests rather than the local
interests of members of Congress.
Ultimately, in 1921, the Budget
and Accounting Act was passed. Under this legislation, estimates were
sent by the departments to the President rather than to Congress, and
the Chief Executive, through his
Budget Director, was supposed to fit
them into an over-all plan. Congress
was still free to make appropriations,
but the President could use his veto
power to kill such additions if he so
chose. The plan worked well—for one
year—while a powerful man, Charles
G. Dawes, was Director of the
Budget with the President backing
him up at all times.

**INLAND PORT**

Here I anticipate a claim from the
theorists and the spenders. They say
that the President needs power to
veto specific items in the appropriation bills. As it is, he can veto all or
nothing in a bill. But he can, as
President Eisenhower did on altogether too few occasions, veto entire
bills and demand that certain items
be eliminated, or else. He can enforce his will this way if he chooses.

And let us not beguile ourselves
by the argument that since we are
spending so much on the military, no
appreciable savings can be made in
civil expenditures. In ten years the
cost of national defense has increased 18.8 per cent. All other expenditures have gone up 162 per
cent. A great deal of this increase has
been in the kinds of spending described so vividly in the *Life* article.
One of the most glaring items of
pork described by *Life* is the fantastic plan to make Tulsa, Okla., an
inland port. It grew through the influence of Robert S. Kerr, who was
governor from 1943 to 1947 and senator from 1949 to his death last year.
First, he secured an "authorization,"
which is a "hunting license for an
appropriation." Then a small item
was appropriated, $1.7 million. With
this foot in the Treasury door, more
and more was appropriated yearly,
until the final cost will be $1.2 billion. The project, well under way,
would build into the shallow, meandering Arkansas River a channel to
carry freight vessels 516 miles from
the Mississippi. But there are railroads serving that inland city of
Tulsa which desperately need the
business which this project will deny
to them. What next? A subsidy for
the railroads to make up for the
lost business.

**FRYINGPAN NONSENSE**

Another fat piece of pork is the
Fryingpan-Arkansas diversion project.
This one, authorized last year, will
take water from the west slope of
the Rockies, where every drop is
needed, and dump it into the Arkansas, mostly for the purpose of supplying supplemental irrigation in areas
where the government is already
spending tens of millions to put acreage out of cultivation. And the states
on the lower Colorado desperately
need the water thus diverted.

But people who lobby for these
projects in Congress are mainly employees of President Kennedy. He
alone among elected officials should
serve the national rather than greedy
local interests. But he is not meeting
that responsibility.

The national interest is also the
responsibility of national magazines.
Other members of the Fourth Estate
are handicapped in opposing pork-barrel spending, newspapers especially, when their base is in the
benefiting areas. But the base of nationally distributed magazines, read
nationally, is the entire nation, and
their support is the generality of taxpayers. *Life’s* story meets that responsibility very well indeed.
