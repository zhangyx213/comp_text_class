**The Concept of F.D.R.**

*by RAYMOND MOLEY*

The people's concept of a massive figure lives a long time after the real personality is blurred by controversy and rusted with age. Such concepts have long survived Washington, Lincoln and Napoleon. And even figures of myth or near-myth, like Arthur, Lancelot, Beowulf or Siegfried, had such an influence.

The human being is a maker of dream children. We create idealizations of men, even though we have little means of comprehending the real person. Among those millions who voted over and over for Franklin D. Roosevelt there was passionate attachment. He could make a hundred mistakes, and this loyalty was never broken. Embarrassing blunders might be made in his official family, but his devotees never wavered. There were always those faithful ones upon whom F.D.R. could depend in all situations and whose passion he could always evoke.

The idea of F.D.R. in part had to do with what people imagined he was like personally, although they knew little of him. And in part it was a concept of a beneficent government to which he gave moving definition.

On the personal side, people conceived him to be the man who profoundly understood their troubles and doubts. This was not because he himself shared their problems. It was not because they thought he was one of them. He was no embodiment of the man in the street. He was obviously not like many people. His aristocratic background, his cultured manner and accents, even his physical handicap made him singular, unusual. But he made them believe he was their friend —kindly, strong, devoted, helping. He disliked what they disliked. His enemies were their enemies. His deep concern with poverty, disease and injustice evoked in them the same human concerns for themselves and others.

That gracious, benevolent image will always stay with his admirers. It will stay—purified beyond the reality of F.D.R.—as a close companion in darker hours, a means of enlarging optimism and refuting doubts.

The concept of a new and unusual kind of government which F.D.R. imparted to his followers will stay on, too. It may be granted that what he described as a government's function grossly exaggerated the possibilities and realities. Those who know best are certain that government can never by itself create general happiness, abolish greed, black out want and disease, establish social justice and bring about world brotherhood. The fact that F.D.R.'s pretentious promises were too broad and were unattainable may, in a calm appraisal, be the darkest mark on his record.

He was too intelligent to believe that government could accomplish all that he said it could.

But despite the excessive brightness of the image of government cherished by true Rooseveltians, the national mind is enriched by that image. Government can do more and more to equalize opportunity, circumscribe want and unemployment and physical suffering. Government can have humanity as a major objective without destroying personal initiative, capitalism or economic freedom. Such a use of political power for measured help to the underprivileged, however, is and has been no innovation or monopoly of the Roosevelt regime. But F.D.R. used the concept with such force as a political issue that many believed there had been no heart in public affairs before.

There is, to be sure, an obverse side of this picture. In the heat of political controversy, the excessive zeal of F.D.R. inflicted unnecessary injuries upon many people. To them, he seemed to be a man who with calculation practiced the arts of a demogogue. The image of F.D.R. which they will carry through the years is distorted, even sinister. This means an impairment of national unity and a lasting fissure in American life. For this F.D.R. himself must bear much of the blame.

As other years are added to the one just past, F.D.R.'s lasting bequest to his country and to the world will be the benevolent concept of him and of government. The devices used to further what he called his "objectives" will crumble with time. Government machinery is soon outdated. New layers of law will be built by others. But those in the century ahead who seek means to help the common lot will find their way made easier by what people created in their minds under the influence of Franklin D. Roosevelt.
