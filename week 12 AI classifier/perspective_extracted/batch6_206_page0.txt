**Durkin's Conflict of Interests**

by Raymond Moley

SANTA BARBARA, CALIF.—Perhaps it
was a coincidence that White
House proposals for amending the
Taft-Hartley Act began stirring so
soon after the death of Senator Taft.
The fact is, however, that the Secretary
of Labor was highly pleased with
the product of some of the President’s
assistants, a product which stirred
such opposition in Congress that it
never assumed the final
form of a message. In the
light of all this, two items
from the record of Secretary
Durkin are pertinent. So far
as I know little or no attention
has been directed at
the contrast provided by
these passages. The first of
these is taken from a hearing
before the Labor and
Public Welfare Committee
of the Senate on Jan. 16, 1953. The
nomination of Martin P. Durkin was
under consideration:

Chairman H. Alexander Smith: You
would not feel that you are the proponent
of one side or the other…?
Durkin: If I am appointed to the
position of Secretary of Labor, I have
already made arrangements to leave
my post as general president of the
United Association, without any ties
whatever to the union other than being
a member, without any salary…
I will not be a representative of a
labor organization…
Taft: In short, to put it in a brief
statement, you will regard yourself as
a representative of the public… and
not the representative of any particular
group?
Durkin: That is correct.
Taft: And you will resign your
position as president of the United
Association…?
Durkin: I have taken a leave of absence
with no authority to transact any
of the affairs. I may return at some
later date…
Taft: You may return? Is there
agreement that you may return if
necessary?
Durkin: Oh, no; no agreement.
Taft: You mean you may; you are
eligible to return?
Durkin: As a member I am eligible
to return.

Now let us move on to a press conference
on Aug. 11 at the office of
the Secretary of Labor.

Reporter: What is your relationship
with the union now? Are you on temporary
leave?
Durkin: I am on leave of absence.
Reporter: Are you going to the convention?
(Of the AFL in September.)
Durkin: I think so…
Reporter: Not as a delegate of any
kind? As a visiting speaker, you mean?
Durkin: I have been appointed
as a delegate.
Reporter: Oh, from the
plumbers?
Durkin: Yes.
Reporter: And you have
accepted?
Durkin: Yes.
Reporter: That’s the first
time in history, isn’t it, that
a Secretary of Labor has
shown up as a delegate?
Durkin: I believe so…
Reporter: Will you pin yourself
down by convention action, sir?
Durkin: I don’t know what action
they are going to take.
Reporter: Are you entirely satisfied
with President Eisenhower’s activities
so far in the field of labor affairs?
Durkin: If I wasn’t satisfied… I
would just present my resignation and
go back as president of the United
Association.

Secretary Durkin falls into an error
that has always plagued such “interest”
departments as Labor, Commerce,
and Agriculture. They do not “represent”
what Congress represents. The
Secretaries of those departments are
agents of the public interest acting
through government. They are no
more at one with a specific interest
group than is the Secretary of State.

THE seriousness of Labor Secretary
Durkin’s dim, confused concept of
his position as a public official is shown
in his acting as a delegate to a labor
convention. He thus acts for a specific
private interest outside the government,
makes himself a constituent part
of a body that may pass resolutions
and take actions against the very government
in which he is a high and
important officer. What would the
leaders of labor say if the Attorney
General should serve as attorney in a
case for the U.S. Steel Corp. or the
Secretary of Defense represent the
interests of a group of minority stockholders
before the directors of GM?
