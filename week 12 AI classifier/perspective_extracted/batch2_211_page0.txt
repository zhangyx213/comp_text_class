Blueprint for
Communism

One hundred years ago Karl Marx spelled
out in just 13 words the formula for the
destruction of capitalism. Paragraph 2 of the
Communist Manifesto has 7 words: "A heavy
progressive or graduated income tax." Para-
graph 3 is even shorter-6 words: "Aboli-
tion of all right of inheritance." Thirteen
words—all that is needed to turn a free
people into slaves of a tyrannical state.

How far have we come along the road
Marx laid out for us? With a graduated
tax on income for the Federal Government
alone reaching 91% we haven't far to go.
On inheritance we haven't gone quite so
far—only 77%. But we've gone far enough
to force the liquidation or merger of thou-
sands of successful growing companies—
the backbone of any economy.

If we are to save ourselves, the American
people must do two things. First we must
realize that we are a long way down the
road—not just talk about it but really
understand it. Next we must be willing to
fight for a real reform in our system of
taxation, even if it appears to be against our
immediate, selfish interest.

The problem is that our present tax sys-
tem is designed, not to raise revenue, but to
destroy capitalism. The only solution is to
change our tax rate structure to create in-
centive instead of destroying it.

Perspective
What Is Reformed?
by Raymond Moley

AFTER a dirty, rough Democratic pri-
mary brawl in New York City,
Mayor Robert F. Wagner on Sept. 7
overwhelmed Arthur Levitt, New
York State Comptroller, who was se-
lected and supported by the regular
Democratic leaders—or "bosses"—of
the counties. Wagner's claim that he
was the champion of reform against
"bossism" raised eyebrows among in-
telligent people. For over the many
years of his public career he has been
a hearty eater at the bosses' table. In
this instance they turned to a new
face because they believed that Wag-
ner had been an incompetent mayor
who couldn't be re-elected.

But the primary revealed another,
more portentous shift in power. All
over Manhattan (New York County)
Tammany district leaders were de-
feated by "reform" candidates carry-
ing a banner with the strange device:
"Down with bossism." This was the
slogan of a group headed by former
Governor and Senator Herbert Leh-
man and Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt.
Lehman and Mrs. Roosevelt's late hus-
band regularly received support from
and provided tribute in jobs for Tam-
many. The "reformers" made no pro-
test this year against the use of tricks
just as demagogic as Tammany's.

THE OLD FEUDALISM

But all across the nation reformers
will hail this outcome as the final end
of a bad system and the beginning of
an era of sweetness and light. To say
that the defeat of the Tammany sys-
tem has been caused by the creation
over the past three decades of an-
other, equally dangerous system may
not meet agreement among reformers.
But I suggest just that, basing my con-
tention on a long look at the history of
that venerable institution called Tam-
many and a new method of cozening
votes by an appeal to the same in-
eradicable traits of human nature.

Tammany was founded two weeks
after General Washington was inaugu-
rated as head of the infant republic
in 1789. Its purpose, incidentally, was
to preserve "republican" principles,
against Federal power. Over the gen-
erations that followed, the influx of
immigrants provided the basis of a
sort of feudal system. The leaders


people gave their votes in return. Be-
fore private philanthropy was organ-
ized, Tammany met the need. There
were corrupt leaders and there were
always honest leaders. But there were
always humane leaders. Some, like Charles F.
Murphy, had a knack of bringing up
notable public officials and statesmen.
Alfred E. Smith was one. Robert F.
Wagner Sr. was another.

GOVERNMENT WELFARE

As organized government grew and
took over welfare activities, and as
civil service grew, feudalism declined
because there was less local patron-
age. Supporters of Federal welfare
clothed themselves with the robes of
antibossism and attacked Tammany
and other county leaders.

After much wavering this year and
the firm notice that the organization
would not support his try for a third
term, Mayor Wagner joined the re-
formers. Then he used his own power
by ordering the great army of city
employees to get into the fight and get
out the votes. To win Puerto Rican
votes, he advocated changing the
New York constitution to have literacy
tests for voting conducted in Spanish.

The original Tammany opposition to
Federal power has, after 172 years,
failed. There has appeared a much
more comprehensive system of taking
from all and giving to some—the "in-
corruptible corrupter of all."

This became evident after the Fed-
eral government assumed responsibil-
ity for personal welfare. When this
same Herbert Lehman was running for
re-election as governor in 1934, 1936,
and 1938, millions in Federal aid
were poured into New York at the
right time before elections. Harry
Hopkins told me at the time that as
a social worker he had been against
using welfare aid for politics, but that
he had changed his mind and would
loose the purse for the bosses in New
York and elsewhere. Now even the
bosses can sadly say with Othello that
their "occupation's gone." There will
be differences of opinion about the
result. Perhaps the new system is bet-
ter because it is the law. But for the
most part the old feudalism kept with-
in the law. Human nature remains
unchanged. Only the dispensers of pa-
tronage have changed.
