**PERSPECTIVE**

**The Beam in the Eye of Congress**

*by RAYMOND MOLEY*

The Vinson report is not, as some
people are claiming, a peculiarly hor-
rible example of Congressional report-
ing. The case is much worse: it's a
pretty typical one. This issue of *News-
week* offers evidence of what is wrong
with its facts and inferences (see page
44). But what is really the matter with
the Congressional reporting that pro-
duced it is vastly more serious because,
before the Vinson report, it produced
the Faddis, Tolan and Truman reports.
And, unless something drastic is done
about it, after the Vinson report, it will
go right on producing the same sort of
balderdash.

The world moves. But Congressional
investigations and reports haven't
changed since the irate George Wash-
ington left the Senate Chamber swear-
ing—and I mean swearing—never to re-
turn. Basically, there are two reasons
why they are distortions. The first is po-
litical; the second is legalistic.

The Vinson report is in the pattern
of politics. This isn't to say that par-
tisan politics account for it, because Re-
publicans and Democrats joined in its
creation. But it is to say that it is a
result of the same process that produces
a political speech—a process that aims
to provide for casual hearers and read-
ers vivid, unforgettable phrases and
sensational facts. Facts are sensational
when they are exceptional.

Men raised in politics use the
method of speechmaking almost in-
stinctively. When they are not on the
hustings and sit clothed with the power
of membership in a great legislative as-
sembly, many of them curb that in-
stinct. Standing on the floor of the Sen-
ate or House, they are restrained not
only by tradition but by the eyes and
ears of their fellows. But once they go
off investigating or reporting, they are
dealing with facts that no one else has
had so much opportunity to familiarize
himself with. They are bound by no
tradition except a bad one.

It's at this point that the curse of
pseudo-legalism begins to operate.
Once authorized to investigate this or
that, the investigating committee usual-
ly hires a lawyer to ask questions for it
and to help with its report. The lawyer,
by training, is bent to the traits of a
prosecutor. He is taught to denounce
and to overstate. There are correctives
in a courtroom. One corrective is the
lawyer on the other side. Another is the
judge. A third is the jury. But a lawyer
for a Congressional committee is in an
altogether different situation. He is un-
restrained by opposing counsel, jury or
judge.

The chairman, for the reasons indi-
cated above, tends to aid and abet him.
So, as the record is compiled in hearings
and in responses to written question-
naires, the heads of the investigation
begin to act as if it were their job to
make a case. They acquire a vested in-
terest in somebody's guilt or innocence.
They do not weigh; they charge. Final-
ly, since the very people who conducted
the investigation write the report, they
are tempted to select from the stacks of
"evidence," relevant and irrelevant,
such pieces as will fit the needs of their
thesis. The report, bristling with half
truths, underlining the exceptional, is
hurled to the public...

If there were nothing that could
be done about this procedure, it would
be futile to discuss it. But there is some-
thing—a very great deal—that can be
done by Congress itself. First, it can
provide a definite bill of particulars
when it launches an investigation in-
stead of its customary invitation to a
fishing expedition. Second, recognizing
that the investigating committee's
counsel almost always functions as a
prosecutor, it can permit every institu-
tion and individual under investigation
to employ counsel with adequate rights
to cross-examine and to rebut. Third,
it can rule that an investigating com-
mittee must have someone other than
its own counsel to study the evidence
turned up by the counsel and to draft
the committee report. Fourth, to pro-
vide competent, trained and impartial
men for this purpose, the Senate and
House could each set up a bureau to
serve all committees of investigation,
just as the Offices of the Legislative
Counsel are on call to draft legislation
for all members of Congress.

Congress has reformed a lot of things
in the past few years. It is time to re-
form its own bungling and unjust pro-
cedure.
