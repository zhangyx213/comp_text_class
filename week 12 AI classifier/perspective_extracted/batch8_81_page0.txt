**Column 1 (Perspective Article):**

A "great Amen" is the country's response to the President's suggestion to his press conference that politics be forgotten. For no doubt he meant politics in the sordid, ignoble sense of the word—the sense that includes reaching for votes, beclouding issues, wangling patronage and seeking controverted objectives under the guise of a national emergency. With a prohibition on that kind of politics all agree.

But the word politics has a broader and worthier meaning. Webster calls politics in its true sense the art or science dealing with "the principles governing the conduct of state affairs" in the interest, among other things, of "the safety of the state." Long centuries ago Aristotle, whose wisdom is unimpaired by time, used the term to mean the art of providing for the well-being of a family—a family which, elaborated, bore the identity of a state. In this sense it is easy to see that our transcendent national problem, encompassing military and economic questions, is political, and that whatever is the matter with our war effort is basically political too.

Even in a narrower sense the problem is still political. On the domestic issue that concerns us most at the moment—inflation—those charged with the administration of our affairs have been and are being frustrated in their attempts to act by two powerful blocs. So the value of the money we receive for the work we do and the integrity of our savings are being gravely threatened by the delays, the hesitations and maneuverings imposed by a species of politics. The lamentable picture of this week was a picture of the President still having to fight off the rising demands of the farm bloc and at last announcing that he was studying wage, price and profit ceilings, while some members of his Administration were even then publicly defending the 40-hour week with penalties for overtime and others were denouncing it.

The reason these issues have not been met sooner is rooted in the make-up of the present dominant majority in Congress and the Administration. It has been said truly that the present Democratic-New Deal government would eventually be hamstrung by the nature of its support in past elections.

Only by an almost unbelievable demonstration of strength can the President break away from the entanglements into which his party has fallen. To do that, he must reconstruct his Cabinet on a truly national pattern, drive out of his Administration hordes of bloc- and ism-minded people, and resolutely begin to put the blocs in their place. But deliverance cannot come from enforced silence on broad political questions. For our troubles come not from what is said, but from what is done or not done.


**Column 2 (NEWSWEEK):**

It is not a labor government or an agricultural government or a farm-labor government. It is a government composed of the remains of the old national Democratic party in loose alliance with labor and agricultural blocs. Each of these blocs is able to exert pressure for its own purposes because, without them, the Democratic party would be a minority party. The alliance, shot through with conflicting interests, has one common tie—adhesion to a popular leader, the President; it has had one common target—the leaders of business, who are, for the most part, neither farmers nor union workers nor traditional Democrats. This simple situation explains much of the confusion of policies in recent years. And it explains in part, at least, our present difficulty in getting all-out production and avoiding all-out inflation.

That there is danger in this situation is evidenced by the experience of many countries, notably France. The bloc system there, in which there was no truly dominant national party, succeeded in governing the country in peace, but in the period following the rise of Hitler it mortally paralyzed the national will. In England, on the other hand, a national party with a substantial majority provided a solid center for all-out effort. There, leaders of labor have joined the government and, despite the pressures of the unions themselves, have served the national purpose. Here, they have cooperated, but without official responsibility, and, whenever an issue has become acute, they have made demands, in the name of preserving their "gains," which have made the President's job of leading a national effort steadily more difficult.
