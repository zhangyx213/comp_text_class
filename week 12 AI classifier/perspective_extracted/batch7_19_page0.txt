**Trading With the Enemy**
by RAYMOND MOLEY

THE score at this stage of the battle
over Far Eastern policy is fa-
vorable to the MacArthur point of
view. On two of his four points—
Formosa and an economic blockade—
we now have assurances and some
action. The fate of his other two pro-
posals will depend upon the future
course of the war in Korea.
What has happened about stopping
the sources of supplies for
Red China does not justify
Secretary Marshall’s state-
ment that it “makes the na-
val blockade an academic
question.” For the assurances
of the Truman Administration
and the half-hearted
measures of the Socialist
government of Britain leave
the problem a very practical
and continuing one.
The weakest defense of all was
presented by President Truman in his
address on civilian defense on May 7.
In that defense he followed a line of
logic that has characterized the Ad-
ministration’s case for months. He as-
sumed that the MacArthur proposals
would “widen the war,” that our Allies
agree with the Administration’s course
in refusing to accept MacArthur’s pro-
posals, and that if “the United States
were to widen the conflict we might
well have to go it alone.”

LET us apply this reasoning to the
question of a blockade of the
ports of Red China imposed by us.
If that were done by us, Truman
says, we might have to go it alone.
That is to say that if we prevent
our Allies from trading with the com-
mon enemy, they would not let us
help protect them in Europe. This is
Alice-in-Wonderland logic. It is de-
nied by the facts. A responsible rep-
resentative of the British Government
admitted not so long ago that if we
imposed a blockade, his government
could do nothing about it. The debates
in Parliament show that the Conserva-
tives regard the nefarious trade with
China as a powerful, perhaps the most
powerful, point they have yet made
against the Socialists. And no observer
doubts that the Conservatives now
speak for the majority of Britons.
Constantly in his testimony General
Marshall attempted to substitute the
idea of an embargo for that of a
blockade. But when we consider that
even the British embargo is incomplete
—a sham, in fact—and that other Allies
have not even gone that far, it is
evident that an embargo is not enough.
When the mass attack, led magnifi-
cently by Churchill, fell in full force
upon the Socialists in Parliament,
there was plenty of double talk mingled
with passing the question from one
to another member of the
government. At one point,
Churchill contemptuously
said to Minister of Defense
Shinwell: “You don’t know
anything about it at all.” The
record says the reply “was
lost in the uproar and
opposition members were
chanting ‘Resign’.”
A week later, Sir Hartley
Shawcross, president of the
Board of Trade, offered in Parliament
the entire record of what has been
shipped by the British into China in
the first three months of this year.
That trade was four times as great as
in the corresponding months last year.
The final act of placing an embargo
on rubber still leaves out the many
other articles included in the list. It is
also qualified by the fact that the So-
cialist government has only promised
to “request” Malaya, Borneo, and
other rubber-producing areas to halt
exports “as soon as they can” to China.
And Indonesia says it will continue
trade with China.
If such a policy of callous disregard
of the human values in favor of com-
mercial trade had been followed by a
“capitalistic” government, we would
be hearing loud outcries from Social-
ists about “merchants of death.”

WITH regard to Formosa, Senator
Smith finally exacted from Secre-
tary Marshall some assurance that the
island will not be traded to Red China
as a price of a peaceful settlement of
the Korean question. But evidence
disclosed by Secretary Marshall, indi-
cates that Formosa was regarded by
the Administration as trading material.
And Britain’s Foreign Secretary says
Formosa should be turned over to Red
China. There still remains the need
for a firm declaration, similar to the
Monroe Doctrine, that Formosa shall
never fall within the orbit of Commu-
nist or other unfriendly influence.
