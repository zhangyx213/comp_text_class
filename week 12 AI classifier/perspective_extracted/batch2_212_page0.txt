**Perspective**

**End of the Grand Design**

by Raymond Moley

THE President's Grand Design for
Federal aid to education lies man-
gled and lifeless after a decisive
House vote. Two final reflections are
prompted by this result. The one is
political; the other, a matter of need
and principle.

Regardless of polls and propa-
ganda, the members of the House of
Representatives are best able to eval-
uate public opinion at the local level.
For unless they are able to do so, they
will lose their seats.

In more than a dozen years of agita-
tion, three Presidents and, in 1960,
both party platforms have favored
Federal aid for the public schools.
They have mistaken the clamor of
special interest groups and lobbies for
the voice of the people.

The National Education Association
is reported to have spent $250,000 on
the drive this year alone. The AFL-
CIO has thundered and threatened.
Liberal writers have had their un-
informed say. And the U.S. Office of
Education has spent taxpayers' money
to promulgate guesstimates and
fabrications concerning need.

**DEFEAT INVITED**

Even the final vote on Aug. 30
failed to register the lack of support
in the House. It was, counting those
"recorded" but not voting, 251 to
178. But the majority against the
Kennedy plan would have been 3 to
1 or even 4 to 1 except for the fact
that the Grand Design had been
whittled down to a mere token.

Also in the package were three meas-
ures for which there was more sup-
port than for general public-school
aid: Aid for impacted areas, the Na-
tional Defense Education plan, and
loans for college buildings. An exami-
nation of the vote shows that few
Democratic members from Catholic
districts voted against the bill.

For this result, proponents cannot
blame Judge Smith and the Rules
Committee. In this instance the
measure was taken from that com-
mittee to the whole House on a
calendar Wednesday.

The President invited this humiliat-
ing defeat. That wise old leader, "Mr.
Sam," told him over and over that the
votes were not there to pass the bill.
But the hullabaloo of pressure groups
was heard and Rayburn was not.
Much more important, however,
than these political aspects is the prin-
ciple involved, which moved so many
experienced representatives of local
opinion. That principle is the virtue of
keeping the control of education close
to the parents and others who pay the
bills and know the schools at first-
hand. They don't want the children
brainwashed by a Washington bu-
reaucracy. And despite the hypocrisy
of supporters of the measure, it is clear
that Federal aid means Federal con-
trol. And the arguments for need have
been proved over and over to be
based upon guesses and falsehoods.

**NOT MONEY BUT REFORM**

When the Kennedy task force re-
ported and the President sent his
message to Congress-based upon the
spurious assertion that school aid was
necessary to economic growth and
national defense-practically no op-
ponents believed that a bill could lose.
There was a great Democratic ma-
jority, and a President in the first flush
of his official honeymoon. But the
principle prevailed, despite glowing
expectations.

Now that this fabricated need and
its dangerous "remedy" have been re-
jected, it is time for the professional
educators and their associations to get
out of politics and back into the task of
education. The parents and the school
boards will, as always, control edu-
cation. But the people they hire must
administer the schools. Instead of beg-
ging for more money, they should pro-
vide more education for the money
they are already spending. The col-
leges must, if they are to care for the
mounting tide of students, use their
plants more efficiently. The public
schools should eliminate non-essentials
from their curricula, and for the bene-
fit of teachers who want larger sal-
aries, the school year should be
lengthened. It is cheaper to buy air
conditioning for June and July than to
permit the school plant to stand idle.
More intelligent and imaginative use
of teaching aids, mostly mechanical
devices, is needed for the training
of pupils. These are the responsibil-
ities of all concerned-parents and
school boards, but especially super-
intendents, principals, and teachers.
