**A Constitutional Door to Peace**
by RAYMOND MOLEY

There were those, over the past year, who believed there were no insuperable bars to peace. Their voices were almost unheard in the clamor of debate. But now, at the turn of the year, they can well enjoy a glow of vindication. No holiday season in ten years has provided so many reasons for hope.

The faith of those who did not waver rested on vitally practical facts. Soviet Russia had more to gain by concord than by war. Its leaders, despite their factious manner, knew this. The United States and Russia have no real territorial conflicts. Even the British Empire, stretching in a great crescent between Russia and the rest of the habitable world, has no points of contact which cannot be adjusted. And trade and intercourse alone can provide the Russian people the standard of life they so desperately need.

The clouds, however, were not produced by the Soviet alone. In the United States there are many articulate people with incurable prejudices against real world accord. Their views loomed high in the headlines. They had no program but increasing isolationism, armament and, ultimately, conflict. They chose to magnify differences and minimize agreements. Professional anti-Sovieteers have been seeing a Russian under every bed and a war around every corner.

But the irresistible force of reality has prevailed and, I believe, will, despite setbacks, continue to prevail.

It must be remembered that those pessimists who have advocated a harsh withdrawal from negotiations have been constantly wrong about Russia for years. They said, five years ago, that Russia could not withstand Hitler. They predicted a separate peace. They said, later, that the Russian armies would stop at their own borders. Much later, they complained that the Soviets would stop in Poland. And then, by an absurd turn of logic, they complained because the Russians captured Berlin. Finally, they predicted a Germany divided through permanent Russian occupation as far as the Elbe.

I cannot believe that American thinking will follow men so tarnished by past errors and false logic.

The average citizen is not clear in his mind about what was done by the UN General Assembly, the Security Council, the Foreign Ministers and other groups. His impressions are general and indiscriminate. But he does know that significant differences have been adjusted in the past six weeks; he knows that the direction is now toward peace.

The major measure of success belongs to the infant General Assembly. Its achievements seem all the greater because they were so unexpected. The Assembly became a real mirror of world opinion, a place where there begins to appear a sovereignty of ideas which is not merely the sum of all smaller sovereignties.

The disarmament resolution marked its major effort. "But," say the doubters, "The Russian potential is only men in uniform and peasants subject to draft; the American potential is in technology." This objection does not take account of the future, when Russian technology will be very great. And it is future, rather than present disarmament which will lessen the dangers of an unprecedented war. It is that future, 25 or 50 years away, to which our statesmanship must turn.

The UN is an instrument of government, and governments grow slowly. Simon de Montfort's parliament was created in 1265. But five centuries later, Parliament was still not even a shadow of a representative body. It took a hundred years more of calculated reform to make it what it is now. The imperfections of our Congress were apparent from the beginning. But, as Washington remarked at that time, it opened a constitutional door for its own improvement. This is what we had at the New York meeting of the UNâ€”a constitutional door, opened at last, through which we may look toward a brighter future.

The Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America, in a recent statement, made the profound observation that conflict among nations is a normal, not an abnormal state. The task of statesmen, backed by an informed public opinion, is to keep that conflict in the realm of diplomacy, not war. That this is possible is made clearer by what happened in the year now ending.
