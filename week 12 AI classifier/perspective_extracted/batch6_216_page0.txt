Building from Old

Maywood, III. Public school
officials here have extended the
usefulness of the old section of the
53-year-old Garfield School by
comprehensive modernization. Outstanding
feature was replacement
of obsolete hot air system with
Webster Walvector.

Rejuvenation of the old section of
the Garfield School in 1951 involved
such things as fresh, light-colored
paint, sanitary asphalt floor tiles
and modern, movable desks. These
improvements would not have been
long-lasting with the obsolete duct-
type hot air system. Hence, Webster
Tru-Perimeter Heating and Webster
Walvector were vital to the plan.

Webster Walvector in kindergarten is completely
safe for children. Nothing too hot to touch.

Here's what Joseph Lorenzo, Build-
ing Superintendent, says: "We like
the new system. Heat is spread
evenly along outside walls and
under all the windows with a mini-
mum of piping. It is much more
economical than our old system."

Unfair and Vicious, But...

by Raymond Moley

SINCE everyone concerned believes
the excess-profits tax is bad, we
need not dwell upon why it is bad
but on the reasons why the Administration
and the Republican leadership
want it continued.

The President said: "Though the
name suggests that only excess profits
are taxed, the tax actually penalizes
thrift and efficiency... Its impact is
especially hard on small
businesses... It is inequitable,
clumsy, unjust, awkward." Senator Taft said:
"It is a vicious tax." Senator
Sparkman said: "I don't like
the excess-profits tax at all."
Secretary Humphrey said
it's a "bad tax." His predecessor, Mr. Snyder, called
it "a penalty on good management and efficiency."
Chief Justice Vinson, when Treasury
Secretary, denounced the tax.

Still, the Administration asks Congress
to continue EPT six months
beyond its scheduled date of deathâ€”
June 30. Why?

Secretary Humphrey said on June
3: "It is grossly unfair to relieve just a
few... before we give relief to all the
other corporations and to all the people." That is a political reason. Because
he was saying, in effect: "While
this tax is really unfair to the little
fellow, he will be told by demagogues
that it is for 'the favored few.' You,
the people, are so dumb that you will
believe that and not what the President and Senator Taft and I say. So
we want to continue to be unfair for
six months more because we are
afraid of the demagogues."

Another reason is parliamentary
and has not been stated publicly. The
Administration leaders are afraid that
if the excess-profits tax expires, the
Congress will follow its political nose
and set back individual income-tax relief to July 1 instead of Jan. 1.

Those two reasons are not economic; they are political and strategic.
The only economic reason advanced
is that to continue the tax six months
would bring in $800,000,000 more income. This, I want to note, is an estimate, a guess probably by the same
"experts" in the Treasury who year
after year gave Truman incorrect estimates of income. Equally reliable people
in the Budget Bureau say the

figure is lower. But even if we grant
that the figure is correct, this Administration could still cut from its own
requests several times that amount
in civil expenditures alone. Senator
Byrd and others have specified the
places where such savings could be
made. There are several fruitful
fields for cuts.

When you pass judgment on a tax,
you consider not only what
revenue you get, but what
you do to the people whom
you penalize. What happens to the money that escapes this EPT? A very, very
large amount is wasted on
excessive expenditures that
have no real economic
value. For the EPT says:
"Uncle Sam will get you if
you don't waste more."

EPT promotes inefficiency. "What's
the use?" says a small businessman to
himself. "Under the EPT my company
only gets 18 cents on every dollar it
earns and I as a stockholder can't
keep that. If I have a small personal
income, as a stockholder I will only
get 14 cents out of every dollar my
company makes. If I have a large
income, I may only get about 5 cents.
But what I spend on personal business
expenses is deductible."

Consider another businessman, who
came out of the war in 1945 and
started a little factory. He struggled
hard to make a paying proposition
out of, let us say, Oozy shaving cream.
By 1950, he was just getting out of
the red. Bang, came the EPT, which
said: "Your base earnings are the
average of three of the four years,
1946-49. Hence, what you earn beyond that is excessive. It doesn't matter whether you are making war
material or not. You are a war profiteer and we are going to punish you."
"But," replies the man, "what about
my competitor, the Ezy cream man?"
"Oh," says the EPT, "he has been established a long time. He made a lot
of money in 1946-49, so I am not
interested in him."

NEARLY three years later, the
government says: "We are going
to soak you six months more. We
don't play favorites." And the Oozy
man answers: "This is a heck of a
businessman's Administration."
