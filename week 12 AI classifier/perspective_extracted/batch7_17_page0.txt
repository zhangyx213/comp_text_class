**Soaking the Well-to-Do-Again**
by RAYMOND MOLEY

THE 12% per cent tax increases approved by a straight party vote by the House Ways and Means Committee not only are shabby politics and bad economics, but they would directly injure very seriously the economic system upon which the lower incomes depend. They are a fraudulent gesture to the lower-income people, whose votes they are supposed to attract, and they are a great injustice not only to the high incomes but down to those in the lower-middle group.  Presumably, this action has been taken to brace the shaky prestige of the Administration and the Democratic Party generally. But if those Democratic statesmen like George and Byrd in the Senate are true to their convictions, the deceit in these proposals will be revealed and the measure will be revised.

Meanwhile, let us look at some of the implications in this bill. It is, once more, an expression of the falsehoods that high incomes can pay the rising costs of government, that straight corporate taxes and so-called excess-profits taxes can be squeezed from high profits, and the lower brackets really benefit from relative tax exemption. L. Robert Driver, a New York tax consultant and formerly of the Bureau of Internal Revenue and the SEC, has prepared for me some figures to show one of the many bad consequences of this iniquitous bill. If this increase of 12% per cent on personal incomes and 5 per cent on corporations goes into effect, this is what would happen to various people who might invest in corporate stock—i.e., contribute capital necessary to build our productive economy and the making of jobs.


LET us consider A, B, C, and D, four selected people who receive income in various tax brackets. A has an income of $10,000. If, after the passage of this bill, he earns $100 in new income by mowing his neighbors’ lawns, he could retain $57.25, and the government would get $42.75. But if he should invest some of his savings in stock in a company and the company earned $100 on that investment before taxes, he would net only $27.48 of that $100. If the company should be subject to the excess-profits tax, he would be able to net only $10.30 on his investment. The government would get $89.70 by taxing him and his company. B has an income of $26,000. If he earns $100 more by repairing neighbors’ cars evenings and avoids joining a union, he could keep only $30.25. But if he used savings and bought stock in a company, he could keep only $14.52 of each $100 earned by the company. If that company should be subject to the excess-profits tax, he could keep only $5.44. C has an income of $50,000. If, after the passage of this bill, he should try to turn another $100 by helping his neighbors with their accounts, he could keep only $15.62. But if he decided to buy some stock, he could keep only $7.50 for each $100 earned on his stock in the company. And if that company were subject to the excess-profits tax, his take would be $2.81. The government would get $97.19. D is in the brackets between $100,000 and $233,869. If he earns another $100 advising friends about investments, he can keep nothing. In fact, he must pay the government out of savings for the privilege of working. And if he uses some capital to buy stock in a company, he must pay a considerable sum for the pleasure of owning that stock. And if it happens to be a new company so successful in its infancy as to fall under the excess-profits tax, he must pay out much more for his ownership of the stock than he can get in dividends.

IS it difficult to derive from these figures the reason why it is going to be so much harder to get capital for new companies? Or to see why the deluded beneficiaries of this tax policy will not get jobs in companies that cannot get the capital to start? Or to understand why golden eggs cannot be produced by dead geese? It deserves to be added that the President, who vilified the 80th Congress for trying to rectify such inequities, secured from Congress a $50,000 tax-free increase in his own salary just before his new term began.
