**Hell's Canyon Hearings End**

**by Raymond Moley**

LA GRANDE, ORE.â€”On July 7 the hearings before the Federal Power Commission on the now famous Hell's Canyon controversy were a year old. In the course of that year, 20,000 pages of testimony accumulated. With the end of the hearings, before an examiner for the commission, the two sides will be allowed a few weeks to file summary statements. The examiner must boil down the testimony and report to the commission itself. Then the commission must consider and make its decision. That decision will probably be in November.

The opposition to the private company has served its political friends badly, because it was planned by the radicals to make great lamentation in the coming campaign over the Eisenhower Administration's "sellout to the power trust." The trial of the issues has been indefensibly lengthened by the tactics of the so-called intervenors. Those intervenors have been various associations of public-power people, and the mastermind they have had was formerly a Truman official in the Interior Department.

The demagogic assertions of Federal-power zealots have been knocked down one by one. The real issues come down to dollars and cents and kilowatt capacity, and on those points the hearings have been most illuminating. The claim is that there is vast need of great quantities of cheaper power. Let us see what the testimony shows, first regarding the amount of power, and second, the cost.

The proposed Federal dam, almost as high as the Hoover Dam, would, according to the admission of the Idaho Power Co., produce somewhat more power than the three dams proposed by the company. But considering the difference in cost between the alternatives, each additional Federal kilowatt would cost very much more. Additional power could be vastly more cheaply produced by steam.

The high spot in the hearings was the testimony by Lesher Wing, regional engineer of the Federal Power Commission itself. It was claimed by the opposition that the proposed Federal dam would produce 1,124,000 kilowatts of firm power, which means available power every hour over the year. But there would be four months, from May to August, when the high dam would be filling up and producing practically no power. During that time the deficit would have to be supplied by other dams downstream. The deficit thus supplied would have to be subtracted from the claimed figure of the opposition, bringing the figure down to 756,000. With this correction, the cost of power per kilowatt from the Federal dam would be .419 cents. The cost from the company dams would be .315 cents.

On the general proposition of cost to the American taxpayer, wherever he may be, the figures I cited three years ago in this space on the subject are substantially true today. The Federal dam would cost the taxpayers approximately $500 million according to government estimates and might run in the end to two or three times that sum. The cost of the Idaho Power Co. dams would be $154 million. Not only would the company plan relieve the taxpayers of a vast expense, but it would also help pay the tax bill of the Federal, state, and local governments by the sum of $10 million.

There are those here in the Northwest who have followed the hearings closely who believe that, while the commission may decide for the company, it may allow two rather than three dams and might require one or both to be somewhat higher. This idea, suggested by one of the witnesses, would, the company says, cost more and delay power production.

This whole controversy may well clear the air over the nation regarding the entire subject of public against private power. There have been demagoguery, outworn arguments based upon conditions 50 years ago when power companies were really guilty of mischief, and silly, phony statistics favoring public power. If ever the facts proved the case for regulated private production and distribution of power, it is in the Hell's Canyon issue.
