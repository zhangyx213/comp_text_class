**PERSPECTIVE**

**Mass-Transit Muddle**

*by Raymond Moley*

ON APRIL 4 there were 55 senators who by their votes or pairs passed a mass-transportation bill which would plunge the Federal government deep into a major concern which has always been regarded as the special province of the cities and states of the United States. The practical knowledge of those senators was shown by their arguments to be limited to the toy underground railroad which whisks them from their offices across the street to the Capitol.

Ironically, too, the glorified amateurs in Congress who now would take over the most difficult of all American urban problems have over the years made a mess of governing the one area for which they are directly responsible, the District of Columbia. And the cream of the jest is that the transit system of that District has been a horrible example of blundering administration. Inasmuch as Congress has been incompetent in little things, it now takes over many big things.

It is also ironical that the major pressure for this sloppy, ill-considered, and massively expensive experiment has come from New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, where three supposedly enlightened governments have failed to provide decent transportation for their citizens who must cross state lines to and from work. A strong assist came from Boston where, despite the Lowells, the Cabots, and the Kennedys, there has been no really good government for a generation.

**LAUSCHE'S ALTERNATIVE**

Practical alternatives to this shotgun approach were presented before the bill was passed. Sen. Frank Lausche, whose long service as mayor of Cleveland and governor of Ohio has given him more practical experience with urban transportation than all of his 99 colleagues combined, offered a plan which would materially have helped cities which need help with reasonable guarantees of bond issues, without monetary handouts.

In opposing the bill, Lausche made a masterful case in the long debate. He succeeded in bringing not only eighteen Democrats but 27 Republicans to his point of view.

The Administration's bill reeks with politics. In order to get the votes necessary to pass it, the bill would open the Treasury to every city with a population of 2,500 or more. Most of those small cities have not only no mass-transportation problem but no mass-transportation system at all. They don't need one.

**FARE-BOX POLITICS**

The fact that politics has denied the citizens of certain cities decent mass transportation has been well demonstrated in New York City. For years the 5-cent subway fare was a Tammany shibboleth despite the evidence that this meant a subsidy. Finally, a reform administration had the courage to raise the fare. Since then, the machine returned to power has permitted Mike Quill to hold a mighty club over the whole city. Labor provisions passed by the Senate went to all lengths to protect the prerogatives usurped by the Quills and their counterparts elsewhere.

There are already a considerable number of very large cities which either have provided good transportation for themselves or are planning to provide it in the near future. San Francisco has already passed a huge bond issue for that purpose, and Los Angeles, Detroit, and even Chicago have practical plans.

The cost of this vast experiment would be difficult to estimate. The Senate bill would provide $375 million in grants and a like amount in bond guarantees for three years. An estimate from an obviously prejudiced source, the Housing and Home Finance Agency, puts the ultimate cost at $10 billion. The actual cost would be much higher.

Instead of putting this program into the Commerce Department, where other matters dealing with transportation are properly located, the administration would be in the HHFA. The experience of well-governed cities like Cleveland shows that the public is willing to pay what it costs through the fare box. That is where the money should come from, not from already overburdened Federal taxpayers.
