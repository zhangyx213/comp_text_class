**PERSPECTIVE**

**How Mixed Can We Get?**

*by Raymond Moley*

A number of the policies and legislative proposals of the Kennedy Administration involve a specific underlying assumption. This assumption calls for critically rational examination. For if such a concept becomes established national policy, our future will be unlike anything we have known in the past.

This concept assumes a further extension of what economists call a mixed economy. It is a civilization in which some areas formerly left to freedom of individual choice will be occupied by government, while the remainder of our concerns will be left free. This concept applies not only to economic life but to welfare, education, and even to artistic and other cultural matters. It is a challenge that raises certain vital questions. How mixed can we safely become? How much freedom can we abandon without losing all freedom? It will be well to raise these questions now. For in a not-too-distant future these inquiries may well be purely academic or, as lawyers say, moot.

Since I have enjoyed, even before the Hoover Administration, a rather intimate familiarity with those thinkers who call themselves liberal, I can say positively that they are not at all interested in orthodox socialism. Nor do they intend to establish socialism in the United States. They regard it as a rather quaint but outdated political speculation that withered in the twentieth century. Also, since they have acquired much political sense since attaining power, they realize that socialism has no voter appeal.

**LIMITED IMAGINATION**

I cannot agree with some conservatives who call the current show creeping socialism or socialism by installments. For the liberal imagination does not reach very far into the future. Liberals are concerned with retaining political power, and that is a matter of today and tomorrow rather than ten or more years hence.

Nor do I believe that this is an approach to a planned economy, although there is some planning in it. It is true that some members of the Kennedy Administration, like Arthur Schlesinger Jr., are still basking in the afterglow of the early 1930s. They know too well that planning as a cult died in the mid-1930s when Roosevelt capriciously abandoned it after the Supreme Court scuttled the NRA and the AAA. To call what we are witnessing planning is to misuse a good old word. It is an aggregation, an accumulation of unrelated elements.

No! The liberal is not interested in undertaking the immense responsibility of running the economy or even of planning all of it. He realizes the chaos that would ensue if a bumbling bureaucracy took over. His concern is to move government into certain sectors which seem to him easy to manage. Also, to leave the task of producing wealth to private efforts so that there will be produced enough to provide plentiful revenues for his innumerable experiments.

**POWER OF CONFIDENCE**

In short, the liberal frontier contemplates a mixed system with government assuming certain activities, with a great many regulations, and with sufficient discriminations and benefits to assure a majority at the polls. The problem which must be faced by those in public office who are not of the controlling regime, and by all of us who are not supporters of liberalism, is to consider carefully how mixed we can get without a devastating loss of confidence in government and in the efficacy of individual effort. Because when that public confidence is shaken or destroyed, even a regime such as this, with such vast facilities for shaping public opinion and so much political sagacity, will meet its master. There will not be the increase in economic growth which has been promised, the budget will show greater and greater deficits, we shall lose the confidence of our allies abroad, and the sorcerers will stand naked for all to see.

In succeeding articles I shall examine this concept of a mixed civilization as it applies to measures before the country: Medical care, the government's "guidelines" for management and labor, and the production and distribution of electric power. All involve potential government dilemmas and consequences which may be anticipated by all who are not blinded by the bright light of official power.
