**Women-Neglected Asset**

by Raymond Moley

LOS ANGELES—The elaborate plans for the Chicago Republican Convention provided several functions of a supposedly feminine appeal for the wives of the statesmen. There were teas, style shows, and the like for Mrs. Eisenhower, Mrs. Nixon, and others. Every effort seemed to be exerted to draw the attention of women away from the task of creating political harmony through compromise and doubletalk. Such a serious matter the perspiring men seemed to regard as a function all their own. Presumably, they are convinced that women cannot understand such abstractions as budgets, peace-seeking, civil rights, and economic growth. They never seem to realize that women are not merely “ladies.” They hold to a deep Victorian belief that women are to be seen and not heard, and entertained rather than consulted.

In that failure to understand that women have brains, judgment, and an infinite capacity for organization work, the Republican Party is neglecting a most vital asset for success at the polls.

At several conventions of trade associations I have noted that while the businessmen were having meetings to talk about how they could effectively take part in political life, the wives were generally relegated to style shows or exclusively feminine luncheon or tours. The rule among conservative men, including most Republicans, is that women cannot understand the profundities of political life and should not share its burdens.

**NATURAL REPUBLICANS**

This concept that women’s place is in the home or at some feminine affair is not nearly so pronounced among Democrats. And the Democrats’ powerful allies, the labor organizations, have from the beginning fully enlisted the women in their organization work, with marked success.

Perhaps this neglect of women as political workers is one of the great reasons why Republicans have failed to get enough votes to win elections. The party leaders have failed to realize two facts: That women will work harder and more effectively than men in getting out the vote, and also that women are more likely to be conservative, and therefore Republican.  That is shown vividly in a most important “market survey of potential voters,” recently published by the Republican Associates of Los Angeles. This survey consisted of interviews with 2,308 eligible voters representative of 75 precincts in the county. The results show conclusively that while women show a lower rate of voting, they are by conviction more conservative and more inclined to vote Republican than are men. No doubt, the reason why they fail to vote is that the party leaders neglect to make an effort to enlist their cooperation in campaigns.

**EMOTION AND DEVOTION**

It is true that Republicans as well as Democrats provide representation for women in party committees, generally as junior partners, and that in campaigns they set up a women’s division. But this is only nominal recognition of their value as co-workers.

I can add to the facts revealed in the Los Angeles survey some items from my personal experience. While I was in college teaching, I had many hundreds of women as well as men in my classes in political science. The women worked harder, read more, and were better able to understand the psychological subtleties of politics than were the men. They also earned grades running about 20 per cent higher than those of their male fellow students.

In both academic life and in the business of practical politics, women resent being treated as a different species. They prefer common participation in the hard work of organization. This is the vital spot in politics. After all the tumult and shouting we have seen and heard in the conventions, the candidate who wins this year will be the one who gets the more votes. And votes do not come automatically. They have to be got out by someone.

Women can contribute the three essential qualities necessary to organization work: Emotion, devotion, and time. They are deeply concerned in the issues of peace, sound money, and economy in government. The Republicans will neglect this fact at their mortal peril.
