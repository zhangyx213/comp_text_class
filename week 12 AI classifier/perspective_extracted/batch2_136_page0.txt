**PERSPECTIVE**

**Whose Lands Are These?**

by Raymond Moley

AN ALMOST unbelievable proportion
of the land in the eleven Western
states (excluding in this context
Hawaii and Alaska) is owned by the
United States. For the most part the
custody and care of these Federal
areas have been vested in the departments of Interior and Agriculture.

In the areas in those states not
owned by the United States, a large
population lives, owns land, produces
goods, and carries on commerce. One
of the vital industries there generates
and transmits power. In recent years
the investor-owned companies have
been building and planning transmission lines to serve their customers more efficiently. Obviously, such transmission lines must pass over public lands. For such easements and rights-of-way, they pay to the Federal Treasury.

In those states there are also large Federal hydroelectric generating facilities. Through slick bookkeeping practices a large subsidy is involved. Since this Administration has taken over, the Interior Department has vigorously promoted the idea of transmission lines to connect the various Federal agencies. This is in line with a master plan, well publicized by the Interior Department, to tie into one vast grid all Federal agencies from coast to coast. Such a monopoly of electric power would move all industry far along toward a "socialized" nation.

**PIGGYBACK POWER**

Since the early 1930s, zealous proponents of public power, notably the late Secretary Ickes, have been waging a cold war against the privately owned companies in the West. Even under the Eisenhower Administration's policy of partnership, the Interior bureaucracy carried on this fight with the strong support of members of the Senate and House. Under Secretary Stewart Udall, the drive has been accelerated.

In December 1962, the secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture, through their authority over public lands, proposed a plan to hitch-hike Federal power over privately owned lines. A series of proposed regulations were issued which would compel privately owned companies to transmit or "wheel" public power over their lines whenever it was determined that there would be "excess" capacity. Also, a regulation has been proposed to withhold permission to build lines over public lands when such operations would be "in conflict with the Federal marketing program." Since these regulations would be imposed arbitrarily by the two secretaries and since there is no such thing as a "Federal marketing program," vigorous protests have been made by the companies concerned and by members of Congress from that region.


**NO PRIORITIES**

The regulations were planned to go into effect on March 15 unless Congress should decree otherwise. Senate hearings were scheduled for February but have been postponed. Senators Allott and Dominick of Colorado have demanded regional hearings on these regulations.

Regulations such as these were imposed in 1948 at a time when the policies of Secretary Ickes still prevailed in the Interior Department. But under the more cooperative policies of the Eisenhower Administration these were rescinded in 1954.

The issue, it would seem, comes down to this: both privately owned and Federal generating facilities are designed for the service of the people of those states. They must of necessity serve the same kind of customers. In fact, there is nothing essentially private about an electric utility except ownership. It is under regulation by state and Federal laws to see that its service is fair and that its prices are not excessive.

The proposed regulations would, however, establish a priority of authority in the Federal government. Moreover, the public lands are not owned by the bureaucracy but by the people of the United States. To compel the owners of these transmission lines to transmit Federal power or to subject the building of new lines to the arbitrary discretion of the Federal government would, in effect, be violations of primary rights of property. And this without due process of law. There should be no priorities in the public service.
