**Power—'Back From the Bureaucrats'**

The long filibuster over the proposal for the Atomic Energy Commission to use private power has inspired NEWSWEEK's contributing editor Raymond Moley, one of the foremost authorities on the power question, to re-examine the whole subject. To prepare his material he made two extensive trips through the power-rich Pacific Northwest, visiting numerous dams, and traveling on the swift waters that create so much of the energy upon which the Northwest depends. He expresses his personal views in the following analysis.

**by Raymond Moley**

It was no mere coincidence that the most bitter conflict in the 83rd Congress was over the issue of public vs. private power. For the Atomic Energy Commission's contract with the Dixon-Yates private group was a manifestation of President Eisenhower's cherished purpose to lift the expense of power projects from the taxpayer and to place it on the willing shoulders of the private investor. In short, as he said in his recent speech at the Illinois State Fair, to take "America back from the bureaucrats and give it back to America." On the other hand, the partisans of public power in Congress saw in this contract a political issue of transcendent importance.

The best illustration of the Eisenhower partnership policy is in the Northwest, where 40 per cent of the potential hydro power of the nation is located. The general idea is to place upon the Federal government the legitimate cost of navigation, flood control, and wildlife conservation, and to permit local groups and agencies, public and private, to pay for the power facilities and market the power. In most cases construction and operation would be by the Army Corps of Engineers or the Bureau of Reclamation. The Bonneville Power Administration would remain a major factor in transmitting power to the agencies.

**A Precedent:** The idea of partnership took very practical form in the planning, construction, and operation of the Hoover Dam. Before it was started contracts for the sale of power and water were made with public and private local agencies. These agreements have been faithfully fulfilled, and in the scheduled 50 years the project will be paid for with interest.

The Northwest is no stranger to partnership or, as people call it up there, "local participation." The Bonneville Ad-

partial to public-utility district power; Washington has. Of course, the vast production from Federal projects overshadows everything else.

In a joint statement to a task force of the Hoover commission, three major private utilities—Pacific Power and Light, Portland General Electric, and Washington Water Power—stated that with present capacity and with what they expected to receive from current construction, their customers could be served until 1960. But to supply what would be needed after that, there would be required, during the next six years at least, new capital for construction at the rate of $200 million a year.

It is clear that the Congress will not supply money in any such amounts. Already the appropriations in the budgets of the Army Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation for the two states most concerned stand out so prominently that they invite attacks from less benefited states and regions. And they aggregate less than the millions needed. It is totally unreasonable to assume that Congress will assume the responsibility for future power needs in the region. The new money simply must come from private investment. That is the hard, practical, economic fact back of partnership. It is partnership and progress or federalism and stagnation.

**Illustrations:** Three projects before the 83rd Congress show the concept of local participation.

The first is the Cougar project on the McKenzie River in Oregon. A municipal utility in Eugene has proposed to finance the power facilities to be added to a flood-control dam already authorized and take the power produced. It failed of unanimous consent at the end of the session.

My other illustrations are the proposed big dams, John Day and Priest Rapids, on the Columbia River. These would practically complete the series planned by the Army Engineers in their famous 308-page report and intended to domesticate the river from Bonneville to Canada. Each would cost around $350 million. The first would generate 1.1 million kilowatts; the second, 1.5 million.

The Priest Rapids Dam in the State of Washington was authorized by Congress in July. Under the authorization it is contemplated that it would be financed by revenue bonds issued by public bodies. A controversy is now going on over whether the Washington Power Commission or one or more public-utility districts should build the project.

**Private Partners:** The John Day project would be on the Columbia below the new McNary Dam. Bills were introduced to authorize it but will have to wait for the next Congress. Financing for the power facilities would be provided by two private companies in Oregon and such public-utility districts as would care to join. The Federal gov-
