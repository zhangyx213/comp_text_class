**Perspective**

**More Value, Less Cost**

**by Raymond Moley**

VANCE PACKARD'S "The Waste Makers" is a very sloppy book. If the manufacturers of consumer goods made a product like their critics', they would soon be out of business. For Packard's book consists of a series of flat, unqualified charges, gummed and strung together with innumerable quotes out of context, and casually picked-up statistics, with a few chapters at the end consisting of timeworn homilies. He ingests at one uncritical gulp the Galbraith thesis of "private opulence and public squalor" and recommends enormous public expenditures for schools, teachers' salaries, parks, urban renewal, highways, foreign aid, and the like (with fantastic distortions of what is already done and is being done in the "public sector"), and unspecified increases in taxes to pay for them.

But the book is selling like 5-cent pizzas. Perhaps that is because so many consumers are at merciless odds with the makers of the things they buy. Moreover, there is an essential point in Packard's complaint about "planned obsolescence," a term which means that some manufacturers, by superficial style changes and high pressure, induce people to replace too soon what they have for the simulacrum of something new. There is fundamental truth in Packard's plea for old-fashioned prudence and his argument for built-in quality.

**TIRES-THEN AND NOW**

But as we look at the automobile market, we find that consumers, in a free market, are reversing the trend toward induced obsolescence by forcing a return to more rational designing and size. Packard's final sentence is arresting: "Americans must live with their abundance without . . . being damned fools about it."

I might add that Americans are not as arrant fools as Packard thinks they are. Nor are all manufacturers.

Consider the tire industry as an example. The humble automotive tire—our lives depend upon its reliability—is the buffer between the privately-owned vehicle above and the publicly built highway underneath. Packard disposes of the tire people with a single page of wholly misleading examples and statistics. But anyone who owned and operated a car 30 years ago knows that he now gets many more miles at less cost than he did then.

The statistics show that the 1960 tire provides 35 to 40 per cent more mileage than the 1930 tire. It costs in dollars, adjusted to the falling value of money over 30 years, only 2.7 per cent more, while wages in the industry, in constant dollars, have gone up 139 per cent.

I am convinced from personal experience that this comparison of serviceability is conservative. For I remember that years ago after 5,000 to 8,000 miles the treads on tires were worn down to the fiber, while now, after 20,000 to 25,000 miles the treads look as good as new.

**COLLECTIVE WASTE**

Some allowance must be made, of course, for the fact that highways are better. But even that must be equated with the fact that speed, the destroyer of tires, is greater.

Moreover, if the load capacity is taken into account, today's tires compared with 1930 tires at the same air pressure—24 pounds—actually cost 14 per cent less.

Today's tires are softer, larger, and give more comfort. There are fewer punctures and blowouts, and tire changing is enormously easier. So far as styling is concerned, none of Packard's criticisms apply.

There are many other products that are exceptions to the Packard indictment. I know of some television sets that have needed no servicing or replacement after eight or ten years of service.

If, as Packard and Galbraith suggest, we take the money of consumers away in taxes and let government spend it, there is also conspicuous waste. And if we take the business away from manufacturers and dealers, there will be less income for government to tax. For human beings collectively and operating through a bureaucracy can waste our money just as fast as we do as individuals. Bureaucrats monopolize the fun, and we are left with the "many unhappy returns" at tax time. Most important of all, we lose something precious and irreplaceable—our liberty.
