**What the Elections Mean**

by RAYMOND MOLEY

People are saying, now that the
elections are over, that reform goes in
cycles, like the ebb and flow of the tide.
The New Deal is like all other reform
periods: it came and flooded the creeks
and bays, and now it is running out.
But there is a bigger cycle than
immediate changes in party control.
Back in 1776, two written works appeared that represented a revolt against
too much government in economic life
-the Declaration of Independence and
Adam Smith's "Wealth of Nations."
From then on, for 80 years, the un-
scrambling of business and government
continued. And then, in states, cities
and the nation, the reverse tide set in.
Things were to be socialized, which
meant governmentalized. The New Deal
was the ultimate in that, and now we
see, unless all signs are wrong, that the
drift of a long lifetime has changed.
This evolution is not a reversal of
progress, it is progress; and politics is
merely the means through which it is
registered.

The swing away from the Democratic
party, considered regionally, is now at
least five years old. It began in the
corn belt in 1936, spread further in
1938, 1940 and 1942. Now, as Kentucky
indicates, the border states are going.
And, since Senator Barkley flatly made
the issue there rest upon Roosevelt,
it is the most significant of all the
elections this year.

What does this mean as we look to
1944? Several things are fairly certain.
Dewey's declaration that he is not a
candidate for the Presidential nomina-
tion will not prevent a tremendous
movement for him. The assumption of
experienced men in politics is that
Dewey can prevent, but not refuse, a
nomination. Willkie will gain strength.
The spring primaries will show how
much. Bricker is still a factor, and MacArthur sentiment is growing. And there
are, as Dewey says, plenty of good men
in the offing.

The confidence of anti-New Deal
Democrats will grow. They cannot prevent the President's renomination, but
they may be considerably more pronounced in their opposition.

Labor-in-politics made a sad showing. Murphy, in New Jersey, was overwhelmed, as was Fitzgerald in Detroit.
The American Labor party did badly in
New York.


All of this is part of an over-all picture. The swing is neither conservative
nor radical. Names do not count, nor
personalities. The tide is against letting
government get too strong. Call that a
return to individual liberty, if you will.
The people, as James A. Farley said, are
tired of being "pushed around."

**What's the Matter With Hull?**

Criticism of Cordell Hull which
reached its height two months ago looks
a little silly now. On the very day of
his triumph at Moscow, some slow-
moving journals were on the stands
with laborious efforts to answer their
own question: "What's the matter with
the State Department?" And political
leaders ambitious for office were, in
effect, saying: "What has this guy
Hull got that I haven't got?"

Well, all right, what is the matter
with the State Department and what
has Cordell Hull got?

The answer to both questions is "a
lot." And, since the recent troubles in
the department prompted some writers
to drag me into their copy as a parallel,
I can claim some right to answer these
questions on my own.

There is plenty wrong with the
State Department, but Mr. Hull was
not born to set it right. Nor was he appointed for that purpose. He was taken
on the express condition that he was
not to administer the detailed affairs of
the department. He was hired to think,
chiefly, and, in the midst of a government of activists, the idea of having a
thinker was not a bad one. Phillips for
a while and, then, Welles was to organize or reorganize the department. Both
failed to do that. So it was a strange
thing for defenders of Welles to cite as
a criticism of Hull the failure to shake
up the mass of sealing wax, gossip and
spats that encumbered our foreign service.

Mr. Hull's success at Moscow is due
to the fact that his roots are old enough
to reach back before 1914 and draw
nourishment from the principle that
the purpose of diplomacy is to deal with
the external, not the internal affairs of
other nations. His patience with France,
Spain and Italy and, now, his diplomacy
at Moscow have saved rivers of blood
and months of war. Mr. Hull has
achieved a foreign policy upon which all
American parties and factions can agree.
