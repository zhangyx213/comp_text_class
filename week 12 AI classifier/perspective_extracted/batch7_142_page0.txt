**Can We Afford to Be Free?**

**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

**1—Toothless Watchdogs**

The title of this piece is suggested
by two items of current interest—
the President’s annual budget and the
forthcoming Hoover commission report. In the first we see in full flow
the menacing tide of spending. In the
other we shall see in vivid detail a
bureaucracy almost hopelessly beyond
the control of Congress and
of the President.

Thus, the question posed
above is no jest. Nor is it a
groundless alarm. The sober
fact is that an inflationary
boom has raised the national
income to a point where it
has been able to support—
but only temporarily—expenditures which in normal
times would bring disaster
to our national economy. We now face
the ebb of that boom. But the pressure
of desirous minorities and of a tumes-
cent bureaucracy is still pushing the
expense of government into new peace-time records.

Wherever freedom has been lost, the
disaster has been accompanied by, if
not caused by, excessive expenditure
and taxation. In this country such excessive expenditure, coupled with declining revenue resources, will push us
politically far to the right or to the left
of our present middle ground of freedom. Hysterical efforts to escape a
squeeze between income and outgo
might drive us to ruthless and reactionary abandonment of legitimate government activities or, on the other
hand, to a radical confiscation of private property. Either would involve
the sharp curtailment of freedom.

**B**ut while extravagance is ultimately
the deadly enemy of freedom, it is
also the monster child of freedom. This
high rate of spending is the measure of
a system under which the beneficiaries
call the tune at the polls but only partially pay the piper on tax days. Unless human nature changes or disaster
overtakes us, this trend can continue.

It is time to abandon easy optimism
and to face the facts. A party festooned
with promises has been returned to
power. The first indications of an
effort to meet its political obligations
appear in the President’s budget. A
fever of anticipation grips the new

Congress. Expectant minorities press
forward on all sides.

The only hope of control is the extent to which the general, national interest can claim priority over the sum
of special interests. The Hoover commission points this up in its studies of
two agencies wisely conceived and
created in 1921. One of these, the
Bureau of the Budget, was designed to
give the President a means
of weighing and balancing
in a general plan prospective expenditures and receipts and to provide Congress and the public with an
annual financial picture of
the Federal government.

The other agency is the General
Accounting Office, under the Comptroller General,
which was originally designed to provide Congress with a
means for a critical check upon the
expenditures made under Congressional appropriations.

But these two watchdogs are so involved in their own machinery that neither performs the service originally intended. Instead of providing the
way through which the Executive and
Congress can control the government,
they themselves have caught infection
from their environment.

**T**he Budget Bureau and the General
Accounting Office have become bureaucracies in themselves. The Budget
Bureau which under Charles G. Dawes
and a few assistants beat down the
grasping hands of all departments has
grown to a huge establishment of hundreds of employees. The General Accounting Office employs so many thousands that its director has his hands
full with his own department.

President Truman is not the cause
but the victim of this situation. Congress must bear much blame, for it
has in countless ways usurped Executive functions, notably in its insistence
that its Comptroller General be an
accountant as well as an auditor.

As the Hoover commission unfolds
its findings in all parts of the government—findings of waste and confusion—the trail will lead back to these two
watchdogs whose power has ebbed
with their own growth. In subsequent
articles I shall attempt to show how
this came about.
