**The Pattern of the GOP**

by Raymond Moley

PRESIDENT EISENHOWER is receiving daily doses of advice in print and also from some members of his unofficial, itinerant palace guard which portend no good either for him or for the Republican Party. The tenor of that advice is that the thinking of the so-called Old Guard is not in the pattern of his thinking and that his true destiny is with the "liberals" of both parties and of no party.

This advice, he should realize, comes either from people who will not support him when the chips are down or from misguided and mistaken amateurs.

In this article I am privileged to use material contained in two studies of the voting in the 83rd Congress, one of which was used by the President himself during the recent campaign. This material justifies the following conclusions:

1—That the Republican Party in the 83rd Congress was, within itself, in essential ideological agreement.

2—That this agreement was in a pattern of conservatism.

3—That the Democratic Party to a somewhat lesser extent was also in essential harmony within itself and sharply and clearly in opposition to the Republicans.

4—That the leaders of the Republican Party in both houses, including Senator Knowland, were truly representative of the ideological pattern of their party in Congress.

5—That President Eisenhower’s views are generally in line with the ideological pattern of his party and consequently he cannot find common ground with the Democratic Party in Congress except in some matters of foreign policy.

These propositions, I submit, show the existence of a healthy system of two-party government.

The study which was used by the President in a speech on Oct. 28 stated in substantiation of (1) and (3) above that:

A comparison of the voting records of Senators Knowland, the majority leader, and Ferguson, chairman of the majority policy committee, with those of Johnson, the minority floor leader, and Clements, the minority whip, shows that the two Republican lead-


ers took a position contrary to that adopted by the two Democratic leaders on 78 key issues. House roll calls show that Representatives Halleck, the majority leader, and Arends, the majority whip, differed with Rayburn, the minority leader, and McCormack, the minority whip, on 39 such issues.

In the second study to which I refer there is listed the voting record of senators and congressmen on a long list of measures in each house which would indicate a clear choice between a conservative and a liberal position.

The members are ranked according to their conservatism. They range from Senator Watkins as the most conservative, to Senator Murray as the most liberal.

“The 39 names leading the list are Republicans. The 39 names at the end of the list are, except for Morse, Wiley, and Langer, Democrats.

In the House, Taber ranks as the top conservative, F.D.R. Jr., the most liberal. Except for Smith of Virginia, the top 175 are Republicans. Except for Javits, Hagen, Angell, Withrow, Burdick, and O’Konski, the bottom 175 are Democrats. It is interesting to note that two of these Demo-Republicans were defeated in the election, and Javits was elected attorney general in New York over the more liberal F.D.R. Jr.

The Republican leadership in both Senate and House ranks well up among the conservative members of that party. Majority Leader Knowland is eighteenth and Policy Chairman Ferguson is nineteenth. In the House, Halleck is 26th, and Arends is fifth.

The proof that the President stands ideologically with the conservative side of the Republican Party is in his own words in the speech to which I have referred. He was asking without equivocation for the support of candidates who had voted with the leaders who rank, as I have shown, with the foremost conservatives in Congress. This constitutes a commitment by the President which is beyond question. It is difficult to see how the advisers in print and among White House visitors can justify their efforts to make a Demo-Republican of the President.
