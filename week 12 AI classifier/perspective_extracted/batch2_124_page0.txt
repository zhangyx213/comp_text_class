**PERSPECTIVE**

**A Party Comes of Age**

*by Raymond Moley*

IT TAKES a mighty effort of the will for a native Southerner to sever his ties with the Democratic Party. From childhood, he has been taught to believe that only in and through loyalty to that party can his personal advancement, his political security, and his way of life be preserved. The Republican Party, he has been told, was the cause of Southern ills. As he looked about him he saw, until recent years, that the few Republicans in his state sought nothing much except the small jobs that fell to them when a Republican President sat in the White House. Those individuals, with few exceptions, were not respected in the community and the state. As delegates to a Republican convention they were gathered by ambitious Northern candidates for the Presidential nomination like mushrooms from the pasture, not infrequently by the payment of cash bonuses. "What," Southerners could ask, "has the Republican Party ever done for me and mine?"

Reason is an ineffectual means of breaking a lifelong habit. Sometimes it takes a shock. A sharp reminder from the doctor is needed to quit smoking or, as the years accumulate, to drop handball and tennis.

But most white Southerners are conservative, and when three Democratic Administrations made clear their intention to thrust Federal power into their lives and economic affairs, their apprehension grew into revolt. This intrusion was not only in racial matters. It encompassed many Federal programs.

**RESIGNATION RALLIES**

The break from Democratic loyalty came easier for young people, and hence, as I have shown in an earlier article, Southern Republican leadership is distinguished by its youth. These leaders have used various methods in appealing to Democrats. One, a political version of the religious revival, has been a series of "resignation rallies" in Texas.

In other states the concept of a "states' rights" break from both parties has been tried. The futility of this was shown in 1948 when four states voted for Strom Thurmond. Also, some called themselves "independent" and supported Eisenhower and Nixon.

But now, after the dominant liberal Democrats have chosen to abandon the South and rest their hopes on the vast populations of Northern urban centers, reality has become apparent to millions in the South. This is shown by the election returns in 1960 and 1962. In five of the states I visited—Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and South Carolina—Nixon polled nearly 2 million votes, and Mr. Kennedy only a little more than 2 million. Eleven Republican House members come from states once regarded as the Solid South. In many of those states, hitherto solidly Democratic legislatures now have small Republican minorities. Even since the 1962 election, there have been Republican victories in municipal elections and in by-elections for legislative seats.

**TWO-PARTY SYSTEM**

In Alabama, the Republican James D. Martin lost to the veteran Sen. Lister Hill by only 6,803 votes in a total polling of nearly 400,000. In South Carolina, Republican William D. Workman Jr. polled 128,857 in running against another veteran, Sen. Olin D. Johnston.

The extent to which the Republican Party has developed varies from state to state. Texas, Virginia, Florida, Tennessee, and North Carolina are perhaps two years in advance of their neighbors in the "solid" South. Within the states, Republican prospects vary from one Congressional district to another. Louisiana is sharply divided north from south. Northern Louisiana, prospering through natural gas and oil, is almost evenly divided. Southern Louisiana remains heavily Democratic. In Alabama, the northern counties, enriched by the beneficent TVA, remain Democratic. But a north-central area has, like eastern Tennessee, strong influences of Republicanism because of pro-Unionism in the Civil War. The areas around Mobile, Montgomery, and Birmingham show a Republican trend, like all other industrial areas in the South. The South is no longer solid. A two-party system is a reality.
