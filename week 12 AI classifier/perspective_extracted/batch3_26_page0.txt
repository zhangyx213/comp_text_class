**A Talk With Nixonâ€”I**

**by Raymond Moley**

IT HAS been a dozen years since, on an evening in Los Angeles, I talked at length with Richard Nixon about the issues and problems before the country. Two years later, in this space I reported on his campaign for the Senate and his record in the House. Since his election, I have on many occasions discussed with Nixon current issues and what should be done about them. There has been a remarkable consistency in his philosophy. Within the framework of constitutional convictions, he has fitted remedies for emergent problems.

It is strange, considering his long public record, that so many different and frequently wrong interpretations have recently been placed upon the course he will take as a candidate for President. Perhaps this is because of the infrequency of his comments, due to his heavy official responsibilities, and because he has had no primary contests.

I have therefore had a lengthy conversation with him about current issues and what course he will take as a candidate.

We avoided general terms in describing his attitude, such as "conservative," "liberal," "left," and "right," since these terms mean so many things to so many people. And since a strong nation is the basic component in strong foreign policy and defense, we concentrated on domestic issues. The following is the substance of what he said:

**THE MAJOR ISSUE**

He believes that the problem of the greatest possible economic growth will be the dominant issue in the campaign. In approaching this end, which both candidates and parties will support, there will be, he says, as sharp a choice for voters as we have had in many years. He believes the growth comes from decisions at the bottom, not the top; from a free people, not from government. This means millions of choices by individuals, industrial concerns, unions, and farmers. When any of such choices prove unwise, they are self-corrected or counteracted by wise ones by others. A century and a half of American progress is the proof. Capitalism with free competition and many individual choices has delivered not only the goods of life but a good life.

The alternative is presented by all five of the prospective Democratic candidates and the dominant power in the Democratic Party. Also by pressure groups, some intellectual circles, and political labor leaders committed to the Democratic Party. It is governmentally planned and stimulated economic growth at a fixed percentage rate. To accomplish this, the liberal Democrats favor massive Federal spending through deficits, with a "little, controlled" inflation. They hope thus for a sufficient national product in dollars of indeterminate value to provide revenue from high taxation to balance the Federal books. That hope is not proved by experience.

**GROWTH AND FREEDOM**

As Nixon puts it: "The way to assure maximum economic growth is not through increasing the size of government, but by expanding opportunities for creative enterprise for millions of individual Americans."

The liberal prescription involves limitations on liberty. For the seers who provide the ideas for the Democrats end with price and wage controls as a bar to runaway inflation. To be sure, the promised immediate benefits are what everybody favors: Abundant employment, a larger industrial product, a stable and prosperous agriculture, better and more educational facilities, protection of those who need medical care, defense second to none, more housing, urban improvement and development, and enlightened labor relations.

Nixon proposes to attain these necessary ends without great Federal spending programs and more concentration of power in the Federal government. They can be attained by wider participation of states and local communities, private agencies, corporations, and individuals, with some help from the Federal establishment. Federal tax reform is essential to loose the flow of investment for new production and job opportunities. A sound dollar is necessary to instill that confidence in the future which stimulates investment and trade.

Next week I shall describe Nixon's specific means to these ends.
