**PERSPECTIVE**

**The U.S. vs. The U.S.—III**

**by Raymond Moley**

The Empresa case now under consideration by the Supreme Court may well have a profound impact on our relations with foreign maritime nations, our defense establishment, and our economy generally. The case concerns the efforts of the National Maritime Union to take over as bargaining agent for foreign seamen on Honduran-flag ships owned by a Honduran subsidiary of an American company. In two previous articles in this space I outlined the facts and some of the arguments.

The National Labor Relations Board, which ordered an election on the ships, the NMU, and Solicitor General Cox rely upon what might be called a set of empirical criteria governing the applicability of American law to the seamen, who are members of a Honduran union. On the other hand, counsel for the Honduran union, the Honduran shipping company, the United Kingdom, Canada, Honduras, Liberia, and Panama contend that the international law of the flag should be decisive. That is, that jurisdiction over a vessel lies with the country whose flag it flies.

**COMPLICATED DILEMMA**

The Solicitor General’s argument reveals the serious dilemma faced by the Kennedy Administration. Political considerations demand that a favorable gesture be made to the NMU, a powerful AFL-CIO union. But there is also the State Department’s concern over diplomatic repercussions. Moreover, there is the Defense Department’s concern over the possibly flight of ships that it precariously counts on for “about 50 per cent of our total active emergency shipping capability.” These are registered in Liberia and Panama, and only to a very small extent in Honduras.

The Solicitor General’s argument steered its course carefully among the rocks of domestic politics, unemployment and shrinking membership in the American maritime unions, the danger of conflict with our maritime allies, national defense needs, and the indeterminate authority of the NLRB. He concluded by urging the Supreme Court to narrow its decision to these Honduran vessels. But he suggested that American ownership

might in other circumstances be a factor in extending American jurisdiction to foreign-flag ships.

Like the NLRB, he held the international law of the flag to be incidental. And, like the NLRB, he considered the test to be the degree of American participation in an international enterprise—a “contacts” test. But he set up his own evaluation of the contacts with the flag country, which in itself revealed the wholly subjective nature of such tests. He held that his evaluation, unlike the NLRB’s, favored Honduras.

**A TWO-WAY STREET**

Summing up the Defense position, Cox stated that “it is the considered judgment of the Secretary of Defense that the sustaining of NLRB jurisdiction over any foreign-flag vessels would raise grave problems affecting national defense.” That, however, is another subjective test. Most of the ships under “flags of convenience” have only slight contacts with their flag nations. That issue, the Solicitor General implied, could wait for another day. It might be two years before such a case reached the Court. The Administration was simply playing for time.

The compelling fact is that there is no rule other than the law of the flag which can be depended upon in international commerce. As the International Court of Justice held in 1960, ownership may change. Or it may be mixed. Calls at countries of registry are not a guide, for many ships of the great maritime nations rarely or never see their home ports. Crews may be of many nationalities and belong to foreign unions. And the benefits of the trade in which ships engage may affect various nations.

In short, unless the international law of the flag prevails, there are bound to be conflicts of sovereignty, crippling labor disorders, and serious tensions with our allies. Chaos would result if this great nation should extend a domestic law in violation of the law of nations. The whole juridical order on the high seas is keyed to the law of the flag. The United States cannot be a law unto itself. As one counsel reminded the Court, international law is a two-way street.
