**A Look at the Record**

by Raymond Moley

A MOST vital factor in the activities of the highly efficient AFL-CIO political organization, the Committee on Political Education (COPE), is its compilation and publication of the voting record of all members of Congress. This booklet is compiled every two years, before the elections. Last time, its distribution was 10 million copies. It shows how every member of the Senate and House voted on sixteen Senate and thirteen House roll calls in the 85th Congress. The specific roll calls were selected as tests on measures which the AFL-CIO regarded as vital policies on which it has taken an official stand. A member who voted the AFL-CIO way is rewarded with a plus, and, if against, a minus mark. The Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) publish a similar rating. The most recent one is for the first session of the 86th Congress. Fifty thousand of these have been published. The policies favored or opposed by the two organizations are almost identical. While I dislike categorical terms, I shall hereinafter call the AFL-CIO and ADA line by its own name, "liberal." Those who do not conform to that line are generally known as "conservative." These publications are perfectly legitimate and proper means by which to carry on the work of a political organization. They supply easily comprehended information which voters are unable to procure elsewhere. To search the Congressional Record to determine how one's representative voted is an almost impossible task for the layman. What the member himself tells his constituents is likely to be prejudiced in his interest.

**CONSERVATIVES' GUIDE**

Until recently, no such guide for conservative voters has been available. But now that need has been supplied by the Civic Affairs Associates, Inc., 2612 P Street, N.W., Washington 7, D.C. Its publication is called "The Free Citizens Voting Record." Since it has involved an expensive job of preparation backed by no such organizations as the AFL-CIO and ADA, its cost is $5 for single copies, and $1 for 50 or more. Thus it is suitable for political organizations, chambers of commerce, and trade associations rather than for general distribution. The booklet begins with a statement of the policies and principles on the basis of which its rating of members is calculated. These principles are stated under these general titles: The Free Market; Limited Government; Economy in Government; Economic Growth With Stability; Equality Under the Law With Elimination of Physical Coercion; National Security. Its definition of these objectives conforms to what Americans not interested in radical change believe.

**CANDIDATES' SCORES**

The selection of "key votes" for rating members is not unlike that of the AFL-CIO and ADA. There are thirteen for senators and eleven for representatives. These roll calls were in the first session of the 86th Congress. A comparison of the Civic Affairs scores with those of the ADA reveals the deep and wide ideological gulf that prevails in Congress. Senator Morse is plus on all thirteen in the ADA ratings and all minuses in Civic Affairs'. Senator Cotton has all plusses in the Civic Affairs list, and all minuses with the ADA. There are a good many in the middle of the road. While there has been a lot said about the relative liberalism or conservatism of the four senators who are seeking the Democratic nomination for President, the ADA and the Civic Affairs scores indicate a very considerable identity. Senator Johnson, who is regarded by some as fairly conservative, shows only one plus in the Civic Affairs list. Senators Kennedy, Symington, and Humphrey score all minuses. In short, they are, so far as ideology is concerned, almost identical. This is further emphasized in the ADA rating, where, except for one absence, Kennedy rates all plusses, and Symington and Humphrey all plusses. This record of Symington will surprise a good many people. But looks, wealth, and a previous business experience may be deceiving. The Kennedy record may also surprise some admirers who depend upon superficial appearances. Perhaps these two may not be as strident as Humphrey, but they are all alike when the rolls are called up yonder in the Senate.
