**After Certain Events**

by Raymond Moley

"FOREIGN policy is made by situations, not cogitations." Long ago I said this in answer to a reporter when I was, for a while, afflicted with a major post in the Department of State. Then, as now, wise guys were asking for a neat, inclusive definition of foreign policy. Now, as then, critics are belaboring the President and Secretary of State for a definition. If these people were asked for their definition, they would reply with a generality. But two may play with generalities, which on analysis usually mean the same thing.

A policy is strategy; its application, tactics. Our policy now, as in Truman days, is to prevent Communism from dominating the world. The landings in Lebanon and Jordan may be too early or too late, but there had to be a stand somewhere, sometime, or there would have been an abandonment of commitments determined long since by the U.S. and Britain. Such an abandonment might well have meant the loss of all the Middle East and the Eastern Mediterranean by the Western Powers.

So far as precipitating a general war is concerned, we may be sure that if it starts now, it would have started later, anyway, when the Soviet would choose the time and our relative strength might be seriously altered. The consequence, whatever it is, must be risked.

**SUEZ RECONSIDERED**

Now we may know that the President and those, including this writer, who believed him right in the Suez crisis in 1956 were wrong. For Nasser, we now know, is a man capable of arousing millions of Arabs, backed as he is by Soviet conniving. He might have been erased if we had not stopped Britain and France in 1956. The British Conservatives who passed under a cloud then will now enjoy a big political boost.

Perhaps our mistake goes back four decades, when we permitted ourselves and millions of others to believe that the virile essence of nationalism was identical with the sweet concepts of "democracy" and "republicanism." Now our 1917-19 propaganda turns to mock us, when the hideous face of Communism is hidden by those deceptive masks. Herbert Hoover was wiser back there when he tried to dampen Woodrow Wilson's idealism by warning him of the perils in Old World diplomacy. This year, he suggested, in his notable Brussels speech that "safe for democracy" should be amended. He suggested, instead, "representative government," because:

"From representative government alone can come respect for your dignity as men and women, your flowering as individuals, your right to a rising chance in life, to self-expression, and to security from sodden uniformity."

Communism is the malignant enemy of all those values.

While the President was right in moving into Lebanon before it might be too late, the same approval cannot be given to his plan for the reorganization of the Defense Department. Nor can either Republicans or Democrats be commended for jamming through the Senate bill under the excuse of a crisis. There was plenty of testimony that retaliatory forces could be put into action in 30 minutes in case of a Soviet attack.

The Senate amendment to the House bill (H.R. 12541) came to the floor late one day and was passed under party pressure by dinnertime. The debate was mostly honeysweet compliments back and forth, and a great gush of Senatorial talk about "able and distinguished members." The net of the two bills is, as Senator Russell admitted, "a downgrading" of the three services. It is clearly a long step toward the monolithic, cumbersome conformity demanded by the President. More efficiency would certainly not be created by a top-heavy administration, with the long-standing and well-understood distinctions among the services obliterated. Passionate loyalty traditionally given to a service cannot be transferred by law to a vast, gray authority called "defense." There are distrust and unhappiness at the outcome among the very military leaders upon whom our future military security depends. "The Army and Navy forever!" Maybe-maybe not.
