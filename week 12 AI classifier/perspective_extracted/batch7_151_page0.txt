**Dewey's Remedy for Inflation**
by RAYMOND MOLEY

TORONTO: Because Dewey—barring a miracle or a disaster—will be elected and will have a Republican House, party control in the Senate is the main issue of this campaign. But whichever party gains the Senate, it can be assumed that with the balance held by Southern conservatives it will not be difficult to enact Republican measures.

This being true, two questions have been arising in the business community. They were clearly expressed here in Toronto among the men assembled for a meeting of the National Hardwood Lumber Association. Since the group represents interests penetrating many lines of business and since in the lumber industry there is a clear illustration of our national problem, I repeat them here: What would be the policies of a new Administration concerning continuing inflation? What would be done if the inflationary tide subsides and a mild recession takes its place?

Those men upon whom Dewey now leans for economic advice belong to a generation which is ages removed from the laissez faire of the '20s. They are equally detached from the juvenile faith in government characteristic of the latter-day New Dealism. Since they have been through more political campaigns than Roosevelt's early advisers, they have more caution and less of the crusading spirit than had those gay reformers. To them, a brave new world is a Republican world — orderly, prosperous, and subject to considered change.

With respect to inflation, Dewey would reject the Truman program. He has already put his finger on the vital issue there, which is more available goods for the dollars in the domestic market. This problem could not be better demonstrated than by some figures of the lumber industry presented at the Toronto meeting. Compared with 1939, prices in that industry are up 330 per cent and total production 128 per cent. But hourly production per worker in volume is 68 per cent, and production per dollar paid in wages is 38 per cent. This is the crux of the problem of inflation, and Dewey, despite his cautious utterances, knows it.

Greater production per man-hour, however, is not to be attained by exhorting people to do more work. Nor can it be hoped that the Baruch proposal of more work hours per week can be realized. It is possible that Dewey will seek greater production by encouraging business to increase efficiency through a tax policy which will permit larger depreciation on and the removal of antiquated equipment. Also, through the development of our natural resources there may be a larger supply of raw materials and water power for manufacturing.

The answers to these politico-economic questions must in large part be speculative. Campaign oratory is never specific. A candidate who enjoys the prospect of success speaks in the broadest terms, and Dewey is no exception. This is owing not only to caution, but also to a legitimate desire to keep the way open to meet next year's problems as they arise. Moreover, since Dewey's circle of advisers, when and if he is President, will be augmented by department heads not yet chosen, we cannot be certain about the prospective measures which may be offered in the economic field.

Some things, however, are reasonably clear, and there are fairly sound grounds for speculation on others. In the first place, Dewey will not be another Coolidge. He believes in economy, but not with the passionate, single-minded faith of that canny Yankee of yesterday. Nor does Dewey have the Coolidge confidence in the infinite wisdom of successful business leaders. Dewey was graduating from a hard-bitten, skeptical law school in a year when Coolidge announced his belief that all would be well if business could only be free of all government restrictions.

Dewey's ideas about what should be done if a recession greets him in January have not been expressed. It is difficult for a candidate to strike such a solemn note. But it is a matter with which businessmen are deeply concerned. It is to be hoped that Dewey will find the time and place to discuss his views on this point, for it may be the major problem of his first year in office.
