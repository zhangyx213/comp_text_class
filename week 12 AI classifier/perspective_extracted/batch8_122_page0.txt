**The Puzzle of Opinion**

More puzzling than all the military, naval and industrial mysteries that obscure the future is the state of American opinion. For the past three weeks it has had everyone baffled—isolationists, interventionists, and that great group that lies between. Even the master student of the public mind in the White House was obviously wondering, measuring action and reaction with unprecedented care, as he stood on the bank of this latest American Rubicon.

Dr. Gallup’s compass has veered unaccountably. His polls indicate that 79 per cent of American sentiment is opposed to sending any part of our Army abroad; 69 per cent opposed to sending our air force abroad; 67 per cent opposed to sending our Navy abroad. But convoys are favored by 41 per cent of the country. Only 57 per cent of the voters polled think England will win. But 71 per cent want England to go on fighting. Finally, there has been a stiffening of sentiment favoring a negotiated peace: 16 per cent favored it at the beginning of the Balkan invasion; 29 per cent favored it at its end. Yet the percentage of those who favored United States entry into the war against Germany and Italy has risen, in the latest Gallup Poll, to the highest point it has reached since June 1940—19 per cent. And to cap the confusion, 82 per cent think the United States will go into war in Europe before it is over.

Is there any possible way to explain these astonishing contradictions? What, for instance, are we to make of the fact that, while 81 per cent of us seem to oppose United States entry into the war, 82 per cent of us seem to believe we will go into war? Is this the indication of a vast, overpowering fatalism? Do the American people no longer believe they can control their own destiny?

No one knows. The polls cannot answer such questions. Nor can experienced students of public opinion who have been trying to gauge it objectively by sounding out opinion through the country. A long trip across the country has not clarified the omens to me, at any rate. If anything, they have become more mystifying since a similar trip in January and another in February.

The only thing that emerges plainly is that if Washington is disturbed about the country, a large part of the country is also disturbed about Washington. “Why,” asked an able and sincere businessman high in the OPM who was returning from a trip to the Middle West, “are people not more concerned about defense?” It is true that reverses in Europe have had a numbing effect. The rise in sentiment for a negotiated peace shown by Dr. Gallup suggests that. But that cannot be the whole explanation, because the effect of these reverses must also be to strengthen our desire for total defense at any cost.

No, a sizable part of the answer seems to lie elsewhere—in things that are being pretty frankly said from New York to Los Angeles. People are asking why officialdom has taken no bolder action than it has to curb disastrous stoppages resulting from labor disputes. They are asking why it has placed several important technical jobs in the hands of men loyal to the philosophy of the New Deal but inexperienced in military, naval or industrial affairs. They are uneasily telling one another stories they have heard about a continued preoccupation with social reform, on the part of some officials, in the face of national danger. They are wondering about the possibility that before Congress and the Administration are through with it, we shall have a tax program which brings home the financial realities of our defense to a relatively insignificant minority.

Beyond this, there are intersectional and intergroup recriminations. Chicago complains about New York’s “warlike” attitude; New York says Chicago is “indifferent to national danger.” Everywhere there is growing feeling that the objectives of this or that group must have priority over the concerns of the country.

What probably lies beneath all this has, in part, been described on this page before. It is that despite the fact that we have excellent reasons to be concerned in the outcome of this war, those excellent reasons have not been stressed. On the contrary, we have emphasized unrealistic or indirect reasons. It is only natural that these should have produced a fluctuating and skeptical public opinion.

Compare what has been happening here in the past year with what happened during the months before April 1917, if you want to see the difference. American concern then was directed at things quite unlike those which absorb us now. It is true that Wilson mentioned the issue of democracy vs. autocracy when he summoned us to war. But it was of the violation of legitimate American interests that he spoke with most conviction. And the spirit he evoked was an old-fashioned American patriotism. We hear now that it is a world revolution that we oppose. We heard then that it was a nation gone berserk—a nation that had grievously attacked our rights. We heard then an appeal to love of country. We hear now that we must oppose a world revolution with a world crusade.

The contrast raises questions. What has happened to old-fashioned patriotism? It has been weak in many notable spots where once it burned with unearthly fire. France shot off a salvo for La Patrie and then it fell. Are we, by indulging ourselves in a desire to seek particular gains, forgetting our general salvation? Is our concern running to specific groups in other countries while we engage in conflicts with other Americans? In short, has Marxian anti-nationalism mortally infected the world, including ourselves?

Perhaps we have heard too much of many little welfares and not enough of the general welfare. Perhaps we have heard too much about the denial of privileges and not enough about the single privilege that we all have of being Americans. Many of us have devoted years on end to an intimate, detailed and frank discussion of what is wrong with America. It has not been fashionable to talk about what is right with it. Have we become so conscious of our national faults that we have lost our pride in our national virtues? Have we become too sophisticated to love our country? Have we indulged so much in class appeals that we have cast off nationalism before we have learned how to create a workable internationalism? What are we to think of the state of mind which makes it possible for an American audience to rise and sing the following “anthem” after hearing a high official address it:

The workers learned their lesson now,
As everyone can see,
The workers know their bosses are
Their greatest enemy.

Has our preoccupation with our class crusades outrun our capacity for patriotism?

I am not registering any personal belief that Americans have lost their patriotism. I simply want to suggest that it is high time for isolationists, interventionists and all the rest of us to agree upon the one thing that is most important—the strengthening of those spiritual forces without which we cannot preserve ourselves, as a nation, as a democracy or as anything else.

The defense effort can be made to yield us that immeasurable value. Unless it is made to do that, in fact, it can never fully succeed. It is as Americans, passionately devoted to America, that we must move forward. A nation plagued by doubts and torn by inner controversies cannot help others. It cannot even save itself. It cannot because it does not care deeply enough about itself to make the effort.
