Perspective

Political Budget Figures

by RAYMOND MOLEY

IN FEBRUARY, The House Ways and
Means Committee refused to enact
President Truman's peremptory de-
mand for a levy of new taxes to meet
a predicted deficit of $16,500,000,000
in fiscal 1952. The committee said it
needed time to "explore." Exploration
has now ended in almost complete
surrender by a strict party vote. The
unsound and politically inspired deci-
sion to impose a 12Â½ per
cent personal income-tax
rise even as amended is
the mark of that surrender.
For it is an insincere, impos-
sible, and unsound effort to
put the major burden on
high incomes, which are al-
ready loaded to capacity.
The point was made in
this space in February that
the President's estimates of
receipts for both fiscal 1951 and fiscal
1952 were ridiculously low and that
new taxes in the amount demanded
would not be needed. Let us see what
the facts and prospects are now, with
the end of fiscal 1951 less than a
month away. The following figures
were prepared for me by Julius
Hirsch, who for five successive years
has correctly predicted the errors of
President Truman's budget figures of
predicted income.
The President predicted an income
for fiscal 1951 of $44,100,000,000.
The prospect now is that there will be
about $51,000,000,000. A deficit of
$3,100,000,000 will not appear. In-
stead, there will probably be a surplus
of about $4,000,000,000. The Presi-
dent's figure is a $7,000,000,000 error.

expenditures we shall come close to
a balanced budget in fiscal 1952.
All of this assumes no cutting of ex-
penditures in line with the sound sug-
gestions of Senators Byrd, Douglas,
and others. If we want to balance our
budget with a comfortable surplus,
Congress should search for more econ-
omies rather than more taxes. If we
need more money later because of
greater military expendi-
tures here and abroad,
there will be time later this
year or in early 1952 to
levy new taxes.

Can it be that President
Truman is thinking in politi-
cal rather than in economic
terms in submitting such fig-
ures to the country? Does
he want to exact more taxes
in 1951 rather than in 1952
because he wants to have a fat surplus
next year to brag about when he
runs for reelection?
There can hardly be anything but a
positive answer to these questions, for
there must be people in the Treasury
and the Budget Bureau who knew
better. Perhaps those experts, like his
military advisers, permit him to bend
their wills to his.

PRESIDENT TRUMAN'S past record is
there for anyone to see. Let us
go back to another pre-election year,
1947. In January 1947, he predicted a
surplus of $202,000,000 for fiscal 1948.
In August he changed that estimate to
a surplus of $4,400,000,000. The
actual surplus for fiscal 1948, just be-
fore he started his campaign for the
Presidency, was $8,400,000,000, the
greatest in the nation's history.
Truman has had plenty to say about
people who failed to predict his elec-
tion. In answer to this I wish to say
that in 1947 in this column and else-
where I wrote that his tiny surplus
for fiscal 1948 would turn out to
be a surplus of $7,000,000,000 to
$8,000,000,000. I also suggested that
in underestimating the fiscal 1948 in-
come in 1947 he was preparing a
sweet political brew for 1948.

I am not yet predicting a surplus in
1952, but I am confident that the
Truman eye was on political, not fiscal,
1952 when he made his absurd pre-
dictions last January and his equally
absurd demand for higher taxes.

Newsweek, June 11, 1951

THERE is an almost certain assurance
of a continued rise in the nation's
gross national product in 1952. This
will produce billions more in Federal
income from present tax rates. The
President estimated tax receipts for
fiscal 1952 at $55,100,000,000. It is
probable that tax receipts at present
rates will be about $8,000,000,000
higher than that. We shall probably
carry over a surplus of around
$4,000,000,000. There will also be an
improvement in cash in trust funds
available for non-negotiable bonds
(money from one of Uncle Sam's pock-
ets to another) of $2,000,000,000.
Thus, if no additional taxes are levied,
and if no great increase appears in
