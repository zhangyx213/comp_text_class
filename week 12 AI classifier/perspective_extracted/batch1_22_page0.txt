**UNFAIR TAX RATES**

**BY RAYMOND MOLEY**

On the same day and in the same mail I received two items that provoked a bit of reflection about income taxes at all levels of government. One was a reminder of the ghastly humor in Mayor John V. Lindsay’s christening of New York as a “fun city.” It was a directive to file a city income-tax return.

The other item was the January issue of the American Bar Association Journal. It has an article by my friend René Wormser, who is a distinguished authority on estate law and taxation. In it Wormser charges that the arbitrary progressive rates in Federal, New York State and now New York City taxes not only violate the principle of ability to pay but impose an unfairly heavy burden on those in the middle-income brackets.

The author points out, however, that the income tax, despite its faults and fallacies, is the least unpopular of all the taxes that we pay—and that we know we are paying. With fiendish ingenuity a generation of politicians has found a way to pluck plenty of feathers with a minimum of complaint by the goose.

**SPURIOUS NOTIONS**

We have been made to believe (a) that the rich pay most of the taxes, (b) that the poor are spared the burden of supporting the government and (c) that business pays a lot out of its excessive profits.

All these popular notions are spurious. The rich bear only a minor part of the burden. The poor are gouged by hidden taxes. And business simply passes on the tax in the cost of goods and services.

The old cliché of “ability to pay” is false. It is true that the bite on the rich is considerable. But despite the populistic trend in government policies, even politicians realize that to apply “ability to pay” would drain off capital accumulations and bring about economic disaster. The tax gatherers in government, moreover, realize from experience that higher rates for the rich would accelerate methods of avoidance and result in diminishing returns. As it stands, a person with a taxable income of $200,000 is left after taxes with $89,020. The man with a taxable income of $12,000 has, after taxes, $9,740. The disparity in real incomes is apparent. But for reasons already stated, the remainder left to the rich is what supports investment. And investment is the root of economic progress.

Wormser says that if you take a table of rates and construct a curve, you will see that it is not an arc of a circle. “It is a curve that hurries on its way when dealing with the lower and middle incomes, gradually flattening out until, as it reaches the upper incomes, it almost ceases to have any curve left in it… the rates increase more rapidly, far more rapidly, in the lower and middle income ranges than in the upper.”

**NO PANACEA**

The key to progress is incentive. I know a professor who gets a $20,000 salary. He wants to earn more because of inflation and a growing family. And so he works harder by lecturing or writing or by summer-school teaching. But when he earns $2,000 more, he finds he has entered a higher bracket and has only a little more to spend. His incentive to do more is then chilled by his realization that the more he earns, the more the government takes.

If a taxpayer works for a corporation, much of his tax is deducted by his employer. And his employer simply passes on the tax he deducts in the price of the product. Inflation creates an endless spiral which grows by what it feeds upon.

Wormser offers no panacea to correct these inequities. He concludes that good sense and equity require a revision of the rate structure more fair to the middle incomes. If this reduces the revenue of government, there are ways of supplanting it by other forms of taxation. Many have been proposed and some have merit.

But when states and now cities follow the rate pattern of the Federal government, they are compounding inequity. And the middle-income people are the chief victims.

One of the alternatives would be user taxes or charges for services. That, however, takes courage which is utterly rare among politicians. Witness, for example, the screams in California about Governor Reagan’s suggestion that students pay in part for their education.
