**PERSPECTIVE**

**ASS IN LION'S SKIN**

**BY RAYMOND MOLEY**

The masters in the Kremlin may or may not be familiar with that handbook for dictators, "The Prince," by Niccolò Machiavelli. But their statecraft fits the pattern of that timeless book. Stalin, especially, may have known it since he was probably the best-read of the lot. Frederick the Great and Napoleon devoured the book. Mussolini wrote an introduction to a published version. Most of those readers seem to have missed the most important of the lessons of "The Prince": lies, murders, breaches of faith and contracts were the means of attaining and retaining power. But the Prince must win. Only success must replace the moral code.

In his early years as an emissary for the Signoria, Machiavelli was captivated by the personality and methods of Caesar Borgia. Here, he believed, was the true Prince. Ralph Roeder in his "The Man of the Renaissance" says that Machiavelli "had shut his eyes to everything—Caesar's treachery, his ruthlessness, his crimes—dazzled by his unholy brilliance." But when Julius II brought Caesar to Rome, a prisoner, Machiavelli "abjured and abhorred his perverse infatuation." Later, in the quiet of his exile, Machiavelli created an imaginary Caesar who would or could not fail: "If the man failed, his method was sound; and the proof was that Julius only overcame him by using it."

Blinded by the great power of the Soviet, we miss the faulty judgments of the Kremlin leaders. They believed the mountebank Gamal Abdel Nasser to be what he said he was, a leader who could unify the Arab world and fit it for conquest. They gambled the Soviet prestige and plenty of its treasure. They lost because he lost.

**WHAT THE KREMLIN MISSED**

The painful aftermath was written in Fedorenko's face as he sat in the Security Council listening to the Arab representatives' hysterical cries after the defeat, their expressions of shock and disillusionment in their "friends." He silently smoked his pipe and cigars, but on his generally impassive face there was only the expression of pained contempt.

Of course, he and his masters should have known of the incredible incompetence of Nasser. Sitting astride rich potential revenues, Nasser's administration created only chaos. The Suez Canal had been bringing in $200 million a year, but this was in part allocated to paying foreign debts. Tourism had netted another $100 million from visitors to Egypt's "museum." But charges to tourists were beyond currency allowances for the British; West Germany discouraged trips to Egypt after Cairo broke diplomatic relations, and Americans, as a report has it, were deterred by "second-class hotels, shoddy service and foul food." The $300 million cotton crop was reduced by leaf-worm disease, and two-thirds went to Russia to buy military hardware now captured by the Israelis or lying wrecked in the desert.


**THE UNUNITED 'REPUBLIC'**

There is oil under Egyptian desert sands, but development has depended on the Westerners that Nasser has reviled. The Aswan Dam has a great potential for agriculture and power, but no one knows when it will be finished and how, if built, it will be managed. As a Soviet stooge, Nasser has a passion for nationalizing industry. Under private management, one plant made money with eight supervisors and 500 workers. Nationalized, it employed 45 supervisors and 1,400 workers and lost money. There was no competence in the maintenance of machinery, and the purchase of arms left no funds for industrial spare parts. Soviet-inspired reforms have only swelled the bureaucracy and imposed austerity on the people. Food is precariously limited.

The UAR is neither united nor a republic.

Frustrated by failure at home, Nasser and his mob in Cairo sought to promote a holy war to drive Israel into the sea. But no one has unified the Arabs since Saladin did it 800 years ago. If by some miracle the Arabs' will to fight were again aroused, they would not know how to fight a modern war.

The screams about helping the displaced Arabs have echoed in the Security Council for endless hours since the war. Presumably, they expect the money for such aid to be given by the United States which they have abused. But why not tell them to use the oil-gotten wealth of the Arab states for this rescue?

Meanwhile, the Soviet would restore the status quo ante. This proposal hardly comports with Russian policy after World War II. What Soviet arms had won, the Soviet kept.
