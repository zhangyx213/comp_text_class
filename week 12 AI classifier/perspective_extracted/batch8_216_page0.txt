**Perspective**

**Martin of Massachusetts**

Whether or not one approves the
defeat of most of Roosevelt's program by
Congress, there is little question about the
identity of the hero of that sanguinary
battle. The honors went to Joseph W. Martin
Jr., leader of the Republicans in the
House. He welded together a minority,
dozens of whom were new men, made it
possible for them to cooperate with varying
groups of Democrats who refused to
follow the orders of the President, slipped
over the arms embargo against the President's
wishes, revised the WPA, put
through the Hatch Bill in the House, initiated
an investigation into the Labor Board
and buried the President's spend-lend
plans.

This was a breath-taking political ac-
complishment. Because it has no parallel
in modern times, Martin has emerged from
this session with the unqualified acclaim
of the newspaper men and of his colleagues—
even his Democratic colleagues—for a
superlative technical job.

To say this is not to disparage the loyal
Democratic leaders in the House who attempted,
throughout the session, to comply
with the President's wishes. There have
been few better tacticians than Sam Ray-
burn in the history of Congress, few more
popular figures in the House, few men who
had been compelled, session after session,
to comply with more impossible demands
by a President. But the policies of the
President in the past few years have raised
up an able and determined opposition
within the Democratic party and, so long
as he continues to pursue those policies,
just so long will the resistance of such independents
as Clifton Woodrum make
Rayburn's job an unhappy one. It is a tribute
to Rayburn that the defeats administered
by the combined votes of Democrats
and Republicans were not regarded—except
in the Administration's "inner circle"—
as a reflection upon Rayburn's leadership.
Congress itself considered them a direct
defeat of the President.

There are many points of similarity
between Rayburn and Martin. Both are
bachelors. Both are men of simple and
sensible tastes. Both are self-made men.
Both dislike speechmaking and work quietly
and industriously in the House of Representatives,
where a man cannot achieve
leadership without the qualities that endear
him to colleagues who know his
foibles, moods and capacities, intimately.
Rayburn has become, since 1933, fairly


well known to the country. But people are
just beginning to ask questions about Martin.
Martin is short, round-headed, dark-
haired and dark-eyed. He's informal, blunt,
and scarcely what one would call a dandy.
(When the Congressional Reception Committee
went down to meet the King and
Queen at the foot of the steps of the Capitol
all, except Martin, wore formal morning
regalia and silk hats. Martin had the
morning clothes, but his headgear was a
derby. The effect was a trifle eccentric, not
to say funny. Martin, it must be said,
joined in the others' uproarious laughter.)

Martin was born in North Attleboro,
Mass. He still lives there. His father was a
blacksmith of Scottish descent, and his
mother was Irish. He began work, at the
age of 5, as a newsboy. Later he became a
reporter on The North Attleboro Chronicle
and ultimately became its publisher. His
training in the intricate and complicated
legislative process began in the lower
house of the Massachusetts legislature. He
went from there to the State Senate. Since
1925, he has served in the House of Representatives
in Washington.

Until this year, no sensational feats
have been associated with his name. He
introduced few bills, although he was
quite properly concerned with protecting
the interests of New England. He was
liked for his warmth and directness and
respected for his political acumen. In 1936
he was Landon's floor leader at the Republican
Convention in Cleveland and later
was his Eastern campaign manager. He directed
the Republican Congressional campaign
in 1938, and, as is well known, succeeded
beyond the wildest expectations of
realists among his party leaders.

All this made it appropriate that he
should become the leader of his party in
the House, after Snell's retirement. But no
one dreamed that he would play David to
the Democratic Goliath.

True, the story of his work during the
past winter is, in part, the story of a rejuvenated
Republican party. Yet there is
more to it than that. Martin is smart. He
enlarged the Republican Steering Committee
from six to seventeen members to give
better representation to various sections of
the country. He initiated regular Republican
conferences for the discussion of legislation
and general policy and for the highly
important purpose of educating the new
members of Congress. He set up committees
to make studies of special pieces of
legislation, and out of these committees
have come the beginnings of a consistent
body of policy for the Republicans. He

thus created on the Republican side a disciplined,
informed and effective body of
legislators able, for the first time since
1932, to provide what the English call His
Majesty's Loyal Opposition.

Beyond this, Martin's horse sense—and
he has unlimited amounts of it—prevented
a repetition of the mistakes the Republicans
have been making so often since their
defeat in 1932. He was always on the job.
For the most part, he succeeded in stopping
Republicans from making silly, unfair
and windy attacks upon Democrats. He
insisted that they hold their speeches until
they saw the whites of their opponents'
eyes. Whenever he could, he restrained the
Republican group from pure partisanship.
Thus he made it easier for independent
Democrats to take the position that they
were voting as Democrats and not merely
supporting the Republicans.

His cleverness, in numberless cases
this year, has commanded the admiration
of experienced legislative correspondents.
They tell of how Martin started the
movement against the item in the Navy
Air Base Bill which called for the improvement
of facilities at Guam, thus precipitating
a debate that led to a national scrutiny
of the Administration's foreign policy
in the Far East. They tell of how, when
Representative Robertson, Democrat of
Virginia, was denied an opportunity to
speak against the Lending Bill before the
Rules Committee, Martin gave him time,
out of the Republican allotment, to oppose
the measure on the floor. They tell how,
the day John L. Lewis castigated Vice
President Garner, Martin absolutely forbade
a Republican Congressman to attack
Lewis in a speech on the floor. It is clear
that Martin has justified the salty compliment
once paid him by President Coolidge.
President Coolidge once asked who had been
given a certain Congressional assignment.
The answer came that Joe Martin had it.
"Good," Coolidge said. "Then it will be
done."

A man with these qualities in a party
which sorely needs a candidate in 1940
cannot be overlooked. It is true that he has
none of the front that we traditionally require
of our Presidents. He's no great
shakes as a public speaker. He lacks that
ease and radiant charm both Roosevelt
and McNutt have in such abundance. But
it is barely possible that the American
people may decide that the qualities that
make for success in a candidate are not
necessarily qualities that make the most
successful President. If keen judgment, the
ability to keep one's head and one's counsel,
a rare and genuine modesty, a quick
responsiveness to the shifts of public opinion—if
these qualities should happen to be at
a premium next June, the Republicans
could search far and choose worse than Joe
Martin. And—more's the pity—there's an
excellent chance that they will.
