**PERSPECTIVE**

**GOLDWATER'S STAFF—I**

BY RAYMOND MOLEY

Many factors play a part in winning or losing an election. Some of these are unexpected events which cannot be anticipated or planned. But the major element in political success is organization. Political organization is such a dry, prosaic subject that much of its importance is lost in more colorful discourse about personalities and issues.

Last October when Senator Goldwater saw the time approaching when he must decide whether or not to seek the Republican nomination, he turned to the creation of an organization to help him. When a potential Presidential candidate belongs to the party which is not in power in the Federal government, this task is much more difficult. Roosevelt in 1936, 1940, and 1944, Truman in 1948, Stevenson in 1952, and Nixon in 1960 had a great advantage. Their helpers were already in office equipped with all the innumerable facts necessary to campaign debating. In 1952 Eisenhower had a similar advantage, for he had been U.S. Chief of Staff and NATO commander in the Truman years.

But Goldwater's problem was like that faced by Roosevelt in 1932 and Kennedy in 1960. He had to seek his helpers from outside the government. Also, like Roosevelt and Kennedy, he faced a hard fight for the nomination.


**A PERSONAL ORGANIZATION**

Goldwater, like Roosevelt and Kennedy, created a highly personal organization. A candidate for the nomination cannot depend upon help from the national committee of his party because the national committee and its chairman must be neutral before the national convention chooses the party's candidate.

The Roosevelt and Kennedy staff members, when selected, were relatively unknown in national politics. They were friends and supporters of the candidate and dedicated to his cause. In April Goldwater's staff members were, it was said, "amateurs." I said this in NEWSWEEK:  "The essential element in this organization—as it was in the instances of Roosevelt and Kennedy in other years—is that these people thoroughly understand their candidate. They know his habits and moods, his friends—personal and political—and his previous methods in campaigns for the Senate. Above all, they have his complete confidence.

"These factors count more heavily as assets for political success than previous experience in national campaigns. As the number of Goldwater-pledged delegates mounts in the weeks ahead, this sort of management will pay excellent dividends."

This observation was amply justified in the light of what happened at the San Francisco convention.


**TWO GROUPS NECESSARY**

At that time in April, Goldwater's chief of staff was Denison Kitchel, a lawyer friend in Phoenix. His chief field men were Richard Kleindienst, also an Arizona friend, and F. Clifton White. There had been notable preliminary work by Peter O'Donnell Jr., Texas state chairman, who had started a draft-Goldwater organization. There was also John E. Grenier of Alabama, whose assignment was the lining up of delegates in eleven Southern states.

The capabilities of these "amateurs" in getting firmly pledged delegates amazed and overwhelmed the stop-Goldwater forces when the chips were down in San Francisco. They became "pros" overnight.

A basic necessity in forming an organization was first demonstrated by Roosevelt in 1932. This is the sharp division of responsibility between the group whose job is to gather delegates, cement relations with state politicians, and to carry on nationwide propaganda, and the group which is charged with gathering and processing material on the issues—material which is to be used in the candidate's speeches and public statements. For convenience I call these groups respectively the "political" group and the "policy" group. Each group reports directly to the candidate. It is a great mistake to mingle the activities of these two groups—a mistake which greatly hampered the effectiveness of several candidates in the past.

In another article I shall describe the nature and method of operation of Goldwater's "policy" group, whose labors will loom large in the campaign which is to come.
