**Plain Talk About Savings Bonds**
by RAYMOND MOLEY

IN A spendthrift Administration, the
U.S. Treasury has a heavy cross to
bear. It must sell government bonds
which must be bought on the strange
principle that things must or should be
quite different from what they really
are. Unlike other departments of the
government, which enjoy the exhilarating experience of giving something
for nothing, the Treasury must induce
people to give something
and receive less in return.
Apparently, the Treasury
has decided to be perfectly
frank about this, and after
granting the bitter truth
about savings bonds, sell
them for reasons other than
for a profitable investment.
One proof of this is contained in the reprint of a
very blunt speech by a hard-hitting banker, Mr. Reno Odlin, president of the Puget Sound National
Bank of Tacoma, Wash. Mr. Odlin
made his speech at a conference of
bankers called by Secretary Snyder
last April. Apparently it has been
printed through the orders of the
Treasury. It does not bear the direct
imprimatur of the Treasury, but it
carries the label of the Government
Printing Office and has been handed
out by Treasury people.
Mr. Odlin comes immediately to
the grim fact that more and more
people are asking why they should
lend money to a government that has
shown an incurable trend toward extravagance and waste. They are asking,
further, why in the face of inflation
they should lend 1950 dollars, with
the prospect of receiving, after ten
years, dollars that "act like quarters or
even worse." Mr. Odlin goes on to say
that government should cut expenditures (presumably for civil functions)
"not three or four billion, but several
billion of expenditures every year."

NEVERTHELESS, Mr. Odlin favors the
continuation and support of bond-
sale drives for several reasons, some
of which, it should be noted, are reasons beneficial to the country as a
whole rather than to the investor. The
first reason is that continued investment in savings bonds will ease the
urgent problems of the Treasury. The
second is that it will encourage the
habit of thrift. The third is that buying bonds will increase the interest of the
buyer in his government. A fourth is
that the American people are "economic illiterates" and could scarcely
find better ways to invest their money.
Finally, this plain-spoken man states
a great truth and illustrates it with a
story. The truth is that when the
public buys bonds it checks inflation.
When banks buy the bonds, they increase inflation. In short, the
public is put on notice that
if it withholds money from
the government, it will eventually pay in higher prices.
Because the government
will get the money by borrowing from the banks "and
to the extent that it does so
finance its requirements,
you have additional inflation
in the money supply."
One man, says Mr. Odlin, asked
another why not "refuse to dig down?"
In other words, if "your wife is a
spendthrift, you just don't give her
any more money." The answer was:
"But what if she has a charge account
at every store in town?"

MR. ODLIN has some sharp words for
people who favor economy in
everything but those projects in which
they have a selfish interest, notably
"Chambers of Commerce who have
the nerve to pass a resolution at ten
minutes after eleven demanding an
end to deficit spending and then at
thirteen after eleven pass a resolution
demanding millions and millions of
dollars for some pet local project."
The big punch in Mr. Odlin's speech
is this advice to citizens in general:
"... the prevention of further decline
in your dollars also is in your hands at
the ballot box. You can quit electing
spendthrifts to Congress."
The Treasury deserves a lot of
credit for giving currency to this common sense. It ought to order several
more millions of this speech to be
printed at once and scattered far and
wide. For the best hedge for the citizen this fall is to defeat congressmen
and senators who have been servile
rubber stamps for the most expensive
Administration in history. And the best
protection for present and past buyers
of bonds is to elect congressmen and
senators who will protect the credit of
the nation.
