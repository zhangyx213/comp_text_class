**How the Parties Differ-I**

**by Raymond Moley**

"IS THERE a real difference between
the two political parties?" Count-
less Americans are troubled by this
question, and many would answer:
"No." This troubles parties and can-
didates, since it is their task to show
that there is a difference and that
their side is the one to support.

The question has historical roots.
For many years it was difficult to
define a party in terms of ideology.
President Cleveland was far more
popular in Wall Street than was
McKinley. Bryan and TR had much
in common. Between Wilson and
Charles Evans Hughes in 1916 there
was little choice. Both were firm con-
stitutionalists.

But in 1935-1936 FDR deliberately
set out to reconstitute the Demo-
cratic Party on the basis of what is
now called liberalism. His success in
that effort frustrated Republicans for
two decades. They had no leader
like FDR to dominate their party,
and Republican candidates blurred
the party image by compromises.
Both parties split within themselves
on basic issues.

But since the middle of the second
Eisenhower term, Republicans have
found measurable unity in what in
current usage is called conservatism.
This, briefly defined, means limited
reliance upon the Federal govern-
ment, more responsibility for state,
local, and private agencies for the
solution of domestic problems, more
scope for the free market in eco-
nomic life, sound money, and ration-
alized welfare.

**A NEW STUDY**

This unity, along with the positive
liberal position of the Kennedy Ad-
ministration, has made possible the
realization of a long-cherished ideal:
two parties with clearly defined, op-
posing philosophies of the role of
government and measurably united
within themselves. Thus, voters
should have a clearly defined choice.
The best place to seek the proof of
this new polarization of the parties is
in Congress. There, by examining the
votes of party members in meaningful
roll calls, party differences can be
found. Compilations of voting rec-
ords have been made and published
by a number of groups such as the
AFL-CIO'S COPE, the ADA, and the
ACA. These, however, have been
limited in the number of roll calls
considered. So far as I have seen
them, the number of roll calls has
not exceeded twenty.

A year ago in two articles I pre-
sented a compilation made on a
much broader scale by Stricker Re-
search Associates, a highly competent
agency serving a number of private
clients. That study indicated mem-
bers' votes in the first session of the
87th Congress (1961). Now the same
research agency has enlarged the
study to include all significant roll
calls in the entire two years of the
87th Congress.

**IDEOLOGICAL SPECTRUM**

This compilation lists members,
votes on 268 Senate and 98 House
roll calls, and indicates the positions
of individuals on an ideological spec-
trum from conservative to liberal.
To show the ranking of members
of both parties in that spectrum, I
have arranged members of each
house in three groups. In the Senate
this shows:

Conservative: 5 Democrats, 32 Re-
publicans. Middle: 9 Democrats, 6
Republicans. Liberal: 51 Democrats,
2 Republicans.

In the House:

Conservative: 9 Democrats, 138
Republicans. Middle: 45 Democrats,
35 Republicans. Liberal: 216 Demo-
crats, 1 Republican.

This is clear evidence of the polar-
ization of members of both parties
on the liberal-conservative scale, as
the authors of the study have eval-
uated the principles involved in the
roll calls. Republicans have moved to
what is called the right, and Demo-
crats to the left. This is now probably
more marked than ever before in re-
cent times. Thus, there is a substan-
tial difference in principle between
the parties. This is a consummation
long awaited by thoughtful people.

Next week I shall describe the na-
ture of the roll calls counted, the
basis upon which the judgment of
liberal or conservative positions was
made, and name some members who
best represent contrasting views of
the role of government in domes-
tic affairs.
