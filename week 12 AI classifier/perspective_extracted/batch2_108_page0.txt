**PERSPECTIVE**

**Uncle Sam, Schoolmaster**

*by Raymond Moley*

WE ARE witnessing a desperate,
violent struggle over the nation.
Negro leaders and white sympathiz-
ers are risking not only imprisonment
but physical injury and even death.
Their opponents’ risks are equally
grave. An education—a better educa-
tion—is a prime objective in this
conflict. But when you ask a dozen
professional educators to define the
objectives of education you are
greeted by a confusion of answers.
There is what is known as “tradi-
tional” education. My understanding
of this is that three of its elementary
components are practical information,
mental training or discipline, and an
appreciation of esthetic and spiritual
values. These relate to the past and
the present. So far as the future is
concerned, the student learns to live
with and make decisions in a world in
which the values established by these
studies will measurably prevail.
The opposition to traditional educa-
tion rejects disciplinary studies and
rather vaguely suggests, and here I
quote some of the educators’ gobble-
dygook: “life adjustment,” “the refor-
mation of the goals of our national
society,” preparation to understand
“the world of tomorrow,” and some-
thing called “consensus.” In the near
past, this has been called progres-
sive education.
For simplicity I have somewhat
arbitrarily used these terms and defi-
nitions. If space permitted, I could
show that the difference between the
two philosophies is not so clear as
this. But the difference is there, and
it is vitally important.

**THE ‘MISSION’ REPORT**

The Federal government, with
which we are concerned here,
spends vast sums on education. In
fiscal 1962 the total was more than
$2.6 billion. Two bills—one for voca-
tional education, the other for “higher
education facilities”—have passed the
House. If finally enacted, they will
add half a billion more to the expen-
ditures per year.
Much of this expenditure is justi-
fied. But both Congress and the
American people should be aware of
the perils involved.
These sums flow through seven-
teen Federal agencies. Very impor-
tant among them is the U.S. Office
of Education.
The related dangers are, first, cen-
tralization of control over the content
of education and, second, the edu-
cational philosophy of those who do
the controlling.
While Congress, as well as the Ex-
ecutive, has been careful to deny
any intent to control, the danger is
necessarily there.
In 1961 the Office of Education is-
sued a report, “A Federal Education
Agency for the Future—Report of the
Committee on Mission and Organiza-
tion of the U.S. Office of Education.”
This stirred up an outcry in Congress,
but nevertheless last year there was
a reorganization of the office essen-
tially in line with the “mission” re-
port. Eight of the twelve members
of the “mission” committee are in
strategic positions in the USOE.
These individuals will approve or dis-
approve all state programs of voca-
tional education, of guidance and
counseling, as well as many college
and university programs of teacher
training, language teaching, and stu-
dent financial aid. They will also de-
velop conferences and give advice at
all levels of education.

**INDOCTRINATION THE AIM**

It behooves all Americans con-
cerned with education to note what
these officials with all this power said
in their “mission” report about their
concept of the content and objective
of education:
“In addition to the Federal level
of public policy determination, the
Office has much concern with policy
at the state and local levels and in
higher educational institutions. Active
leadership by the Office to encourage
constructive consensus on particular
problems or issues in American edu-
cation helps to crystallize public pol-
icy at all levels.”
This, then, is the prescription to
establish under an elite, the mem-
bers of which think alike on public
policies, a vast system of indoctrina-
tion in our schools, colleges, and uni-
versities everywhere. Their pious
denial of the word “control” is not
relevant. For control by whatever re-
gime is in the White House is real,
active, and apparent.
