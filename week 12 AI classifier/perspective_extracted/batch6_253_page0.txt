HIS election is something more than
a referendum on issues or a means
of driving out the shabby crowd now
in office. It is the selection of one of
two men for the terrific responsibility
of the Presidential office. Hence, the
intellectual bent, habits, and former
associations of Adlai Stevenson are
of primary importance. For "as he
thinketh in his heart, so is he."
A man's mental character
is a blend of his basic emo-
tional qualities shaped by
the influences that have
played most actively upon
him as he has passed
through life.
Until Stevenson's gradua-
tion from Princeton in 1922,
he was a boy and young
man who never had to face
real responsibility. His par-
ents were rich enough to assure him
all relief from the problem of making a
living, but not rich enough to impose
upon him the vast responsibility of
large financial affairs. He was a medi-
ocre student. But he was apparently
sufficiently politic to get into prep
school and college journalism.
Then there were two years at the
Harvard Law School and another at
Northwestern. Here he was exposed
to a very powerful current of thought
that was at high tide in the '20s. That
I remember very clearly myself, for I
was in university teaching at the time
and close to what was virtually a
revolution in law-school teaching.
One of the most potent influences in
that current of thought was what was
called by a Harvard law professor of
the '20s "futilitarianism." This was an
ardent surrender to the doctrine of a
materialistic school of sociology that
held that environment is everything
and that man is the helpless product
of what is around him; also to the
James-Dewey philosophy of pragma-
tism which, according to James, "turns
away from fixed principles." Or, as
Justice Holmes said: "No general
proposition is worth a damn." And: "I
wonder if cosmically an idea is any
more important than bowels." Holmes
was the idol of the group with which
Stevenson was associated in Washing-
ton, and Holmes is the authority he
loves to quote in his speeches.
In 1933, as I well remember, Wash-


**Column 2 (Article):**

ington was a busy hive of young law-
yers, mostly sponsored by the then
Prof. Felix Frankfurter and generally
placed in jobs by Tom Corcoran, a
Frankfurter-Holmes disciple. A whole
group was pushed into the Treasury,
with Dean Acheson as front man. An-
other group went into the AAA. This
group included the Hiss boys and Lee
Pressman. Stevenson was in that
group. There, as he told the farmers in
Minnesota, he learned the
problems of agriculture.
After two years in that at-
mosphere, he drifted back
to Chicago. But the affinity
for the Washington atmos-
phere was too strong, and
later we find him as assistant
and, according to his own
words, speech writer for the
Secretary of the Navy. Then
there were assignments in
and around the diplomatic service.
The broad picture is a man who
was never a positive force, never
building up a business, never writing
an important book, never creating and
fighting for an original idea-drifting,
drifting, but never far from the liter-
ate demagoguery of the radical crowd
that gave color to Washington over
the past twenty years. In short, a
political dilettante-a kibitzer, not a
participant-doing agreeable things,
avoiding the risks and rigors of crea-
tive effort; never a man to stand alone
and fight for a principle, nor a recog-
nized leader in law or journalism or in
literature. In fact, the only ideas
Stevenson has sponsored in this cam-
paign were created by people who
went before-by Roosevelt and his
early advisers, and by Truman and
his merry men.
S GOVERNOR, Stevenson created an
A atmosphere thus described by
John B. Martin in a current book. He
says of the Stevenson inner circle in
Springfield that there was "a good
deal of intellectual horsing around
There is an ebullience about them all.
They wear bow ties and crew hair-
cuts. They like to talk and to argue
They are the sort of men one expects
to find not in a politician's anteroom
but in a club patronized by young
men in the arts, sciences, and pro-
fessions. The Stevenson administration
has always been a rather lighthearted
reform movement."
