**Accent on Mediocrity**

by Raymond Moley

In a burst of indignation James Reston of The New York Times recently pointed out something that deserves attention in every state in which governors are to be chosen this year: "The governors of the states, taken as a whole, are a poor lot...Most of the state capitals are up to their heads in problems, and up to their knees in midgets."

Like Reston, I have had a good opportunity to evaluate these governors in their states and also in their annual Governors Conferences. There prevails among them a sad strain of mediocrity, even as Reston suggests, of Babbittry and a dearth of leadership.

In 1961 I had the opportunity to address the Governors Conference in Honolulu on the serious problem of Federal aid to education. What most of their excellencies said after I had presented my statement added up to the assertion that if there were any Federal money to be had they were bidding for first-class tickets on the gravy train.

This session and one other during the week were the only serious meetings on the agenda. The rest of the governors' time was given to social affairs. Most of the governors donned funny flaming shirts over-hanging executive pantaloons and swayed about from party to party to the rhythm of whining songs and the twanging of tropical instruments. The alleged statesmen had a wonderful time until the last "aloha."

Consider some of the incumbents now seeking re-election in big states, from the bumbling Brown in California to the negative Volpe in Massachusetts, the amiable DiSalle in Ohio, the Reuther-geared Swainson in Michigan. Among them all, only Rockefeller is a serious contender for a Presidential nomination.

**PAST DISTINCTION**

Time was when the nation's political parties sought suitable Presidential candidates from an array of distinguished state executives. Since Lincoln's time there were Hayes, Cleveland, McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt, Wilson, Coolidge, and Franklin D. Roosevelt who met the test. Others equally distinguished who missed the Presidency were Tilden, Hughes, and Dewey. La Follette and Hiram Johnson were serious contenders who missed their party's nomination.

Where are the successors of these men and where is the tradition of strong governors?

I suggest that the trend toward liberal policies and a centralized Federal establishment has had much to do with the decline. Governors get elected these days because they claim that they will get more from Uncle Sam in grants in aid, defense contracts, and other unearned benefits. To stand firmly for the integrity of their states in the Federal system under the Constitution means taxing their people to meet their own problems. The rosy road to popularity is not to stand for states' rights and responsibility. The context of these times so prevalent in education, labor policy, and in other aspects of our life demands conformity not capacity.

**THEORY NO TEST**

A candidate's ideology is only one of the vital tests for public office. Milwaukee had fine, efficient, honest government for years under a Socialist mayor. There was no socialism in efficient cleaning of streets and upholding law and in caring for the unfortunate.

At the national level the administration of foreign affairs, national defense, foreign aid, welfare, and other services should involve far more than adherence to any theory. Hard common sense, a clear head, and experience count most in running a government. Anyone with a capacity for novelty and an elastic conscience can subscribe to a formula. Practically anyone can make a speech. If not, there are ghosts in plenty. Almost anyone can write a law and there are always lobbyist lawyers and bureaucrats to frame the language.

But the implementation of the law through practical, experienced, skillful administrators calls for uncommon people. Here liberalism has its fatal weakness. The liberal politician and voter distrust business. But American business has the richest pool of executive talent in the world. In most of our states only average executives fumble with very difficult jobs. There is the rub. A fool in the pulpit can make the Divine Word a superstitious travesty.
