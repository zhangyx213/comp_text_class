**Same Theme With Variations**

by Raymond Moley

GOVERNOR STEVENSON'S speech on
foreign policy in San Francisco,
like most of his compositions, hardly
belongs in the realm of practical
statesmanship. It belongs in the thin
air of impressionistic artistry. Perhaps
we should call it "Variations on a
Theme by Acheson."

There is added, moreover, a broad
strain that harkens back to the claims
of those who, a few years ago,
maintained that Mao and his men
were only agrarian reformers. The
impact of the speech is a frightening
sense of things to come if its author
should be elected President.

Stevenson's thought habit is
precisely that of a numerous school of
soft thinkers who like to appropriate
the good old word "liberal" to screen
their affinity for various forms of
statism. His attitude toward those who
fear socialistic trends at home is full of
contemptuous humor. Socialism, under
the name of Communism abroad, he
regards sentimentally as the
manifestation of human aspiration for
the more abundant life. Note this
passage from his speech: "There is an
important difference between
Communism as we view it and
Communism as some of the Asian
peoples view it. When we think of
Communism we think of what we are
going to lose. When many of the Asian
peoples think of Communism, they
think of what they are going to win..."

This seems to say that hundreds of
millions of Chinese, out of all forms of
social amelioration, have selected
Communism as the best in a popular
referendum and that they have
selected Mao as the person best
qualified to bring them the abundance
they crave. It misses the hard fact that
the Chinese people had little to say
about it all and that they probably
never weighed Communism as an answer
to anything. It ignores the hard fact
that China was seized and is ruthlessly
exploited by a gang of revolutionaries
trained in Russia and that these
scoundrels are driving their puppets into
battle against American troops, while
across the table at Panmunjom their
negotiators are lying about peace.

This sentimental strain also
manifested itself in Stevenson's speech to


the American Legion. There was very
limited attention to the domestic
Communists and their dupes in official,
literary, and academic life. But there
was a lot of scorn and denunciation
for those who are opposing
Communism and Communistic
influences in our life.

If this sort of thing is not a form of
appeasement of Communism, I fail to
see the distinction. Raymond
McConnell Jr. of The Lincoln State
Journal is the only commentator, so far
as I know, who pointed out that the
quotation used in the Legion speech,
"we can pluck this flower, safety, from
this nettle, danger," was the same gem
used by Neville Chamberlain when he
returned from his appeasement
conferences with Hitler.

The San Francisco speech also had a
great deal to say about how we must
help India and other Asiatic countries
with economic aid so that their people
will not choose Communism. There is
only a slight reference to the
importance to our safety of the bastions
of Formosa and Japan. This again
reflects the priority which Truman and
Acheson have always given to far-off
remedies for Communism, rather than to
immediate and practical protective
measures. We can pay indefinitely to
buy off countries by aid, while we
neglect the immediate, practical
military situation.


AGAINST this artful screen of words,
the basic proposals of General
Eisenhower's Philadelphia speech stand
out still more clearly. Truman,
Stevenson, and others have sought to
make a great fuss about Eisenhower's
suggestion that by appropriate means
we can work toward the liberation of
the satellites. Of course, no one in his
right mind, least of all Eisenhower, who
knows more about the European
satellites than anyone on the Democratic
side, believes that a revolution can be
started in those countries overnight. But
the seeds can be sown by vigorous
counterespionage, by sabotage, by
corrupting the centers of Communist
strength with an underground, and other
means. It is a sound idea and ultimately
the only way to neutralize the Soviet
menace.
