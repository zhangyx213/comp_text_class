**A Carnival of Ghosts**

by RAYMOND MOLEY

Sen. Wayne Morse's reference to
Sen. Robert A. Taft as a "reactionary"
suggested nothing so much as the pot's
well-worn reference to the color of the
kettle. Are we to have a revival of the
battle, long ago, between Taft con-
servatism and La Follette progressiv-
ism?

Senator Morse is distinctly in the
La Follette tradition. He was born
near Madison, Wisconsin, a
few days before Old Bob
was first elected governor of
the state. At the University
of Wisconsin, he was a con-
temporary of former Gov-
ernor Philip La Follette. He
knew the great progressive
himself and spent some
years working on a book
about him. As Mr. Morse's
faculty adviser later, at Co-
lumbia, I knew him to be a
man of courage, intelligence and vision.
But if I should take advantage of
that relationship again, I should advise
Mr. Morse that the progressivism of
30-odd years ago is as inappropriate
to these times as is the stalwart faith
of William H. Taft. The names and
the slogans may be the same, but the
conditions, the remedies, the program:
of the old progressivism have little ap-
plication to the America of 1946. Even
the neo-progressivism of 1933, which
was called the New Deal, is outdated.

A revival of the old Republican
struggle, with younger prototypes of
the old principals, suggests to me the
nostalgia I felt, this year, when I saw
the revival of "The Red Mill." It was
in 1908 that I first saw that incom-
parable musical show. The revival is
good-the music and the gentle com-
edy are there. But the current Foy
and O'Shea are not Montgomery and
Stone. There can never be such a
twain. Even if they could be brought
back in their youth, we ourselves
would find that we had lost a sense
of the days when the mellow air of
vaudeville and the circus pervaded
the land.

It is quite possible to share Senator
Morse's impatience with Republican
leadership. The country wants some-
thing better than mere criticism of the
Truman Administration in domestic af-
fairs. Simple conservatism cannot pro-
vide a party program.

But the old-time "progressive" faith
in more and more government will not
meet present-day conditions. We have
already loaded government with more
than it can effectively carry. The as-
sumption of the two Roosevelts that
our political and economic systems
must be invaded by a creeping statism
was a relic of the Socialist view that
the rising curve of government must
go on and on. That view neglected a
very important fact.

That fact is that government power
has not, in the history of the
world, been an ever-rising
curve. It has gone up over
long periods of years and it
has gone down. The forms
and character of human ac-
tivities are in a state of con-
stant change. Science, cus-
tom and other influences are
constantly turning interests,
businesses and occupations
hither and yon. The moment
a government gathers some
aspect of life into its arms, new activi-
ties are born elsewhere and are con-
trolled by nongovernmental persons
and agencies. Socialism is too slow
to keep up with life.

A program suited to 1946 should
recognize that people learn ways of
privately organized collective action
so rapidly that government, instead
of seeking new power, should encour-
age these activities and keep itself
free to serve as mediator, friend and
mentor.

To illustrate, the NLRB was cre-
ated to protect labor's right to organ-
ize. Labor, meanwhile, has organized.
But the NLRB got itself into the busi-
ness of organizing. Without repealing
the whole National Labor Relations
Act, why not consider how it may be
modified to permit government to cut
down its interference in the business
of organization? No doubt, if the SEC
could be reconsidered-not repealed-
large segments of its activities could
be turned over to private associations.
And the fact of private cooperation in
health and medical care is the most
potent argument against schemes for
government medicine like the Wag-
ner bill.

A recognition of the value of pri-
vately stimulated progress would not
be reaction or conservatism. Statism
and stark individualism are not grounds
for a modern faith, nor should they
be debated as alternatives. To revive
the "Progressive-Old Guard" battle of
1908-14 is to promote a carnival of
ghosts.
