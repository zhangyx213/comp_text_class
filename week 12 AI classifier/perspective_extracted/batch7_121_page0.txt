**Grim Alternatives**

by RAYMOND MOLEY

In a little more than a month, Federal books will close on fiscal year 1949 and open on fiscal 1950. Only giddy optimists and callous vote hucksters can close their eyes to the deplorable prospect presented by the figures involved in the forthcoming Federal expenditures and receipts. Those figures cast their threat over every dollar of our savings, every insurance policy, every business plan—especially those of small businesses. They are a nightmare to every taxpayer who needs dollars for the improvement of his home, the education of his children, and the protection of his old age and for the meeting of emergencies like illness or death in the family. If these be the “people” to whom politicians mouth their appeals, it behooves those politicians to bestir themselves before it is too late.

In January the President presented, in an unintelligible budget of 1,625 pages of undigested figures, a prospect for fiscal 1950 of expenditures of approximately $900,000,000 more than would be forthcoming in receipts.

Since the members of the Congressional Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation are concerned with raising the revenues to satisfy projected expenditures, they have accepted the President’s estimate of $41,900,000,000 in expenditures. But, very realistically, they have noted that the President underestimated the deficit by $2,100,000,000. They figure that receipts will be only $38,900,000,000 and not the $41,000,000,000 that the President anticipated.

The basis for this is their revision of the President’s expectation of national income for fiscal 1950. The President made the preposterous assumption that the rate of national income in December, when his figures were compiled, would continue without interruption for eighteen months. That rate was $215,000,000,000 a year. This estimate was probably sold to the President because of the overoptimism of his economic advisers, who were at that time predicting a steady 4-per-cent-a-year increase in gross national product. That was before “disinflation” had burst upon them.

The Congressional people recognize the reality of a decline and anticipate a fall in the national income to a rate of $198,000,000,000 in the first six months of 1950. Since with the same tax rates the decline in revenue is relatively greater than the decline in income, the Congressional estimate of considerably lower revenue is more realistic than the President’s appraisal.

In the judgment of other good economists, the decline may drop national revenues to $38,000,000,000 or less.

But the Truman estimate of expenditures is clearly too low. Senator Byrd estimates fiscal 1950 spending at $44,300,000,000. There is, therefore, a prospect of a deficit of from $3,000,000,000 to $6,500,000,000.

There are, of course, three ways to meet this: Spend less; tax more; or live with a deficit.

The Truman proposal is to tax more. That means a new burden on a declining income and reduced business profits, which may be self-defeating since more taxes will certainly depress business further. In short, a tax boost may result in less rather than more revenue.

It must be noted that, while the President views a deficit with studied alarm, a considerable number, perhaps most, of his advisers regard deficit spending as wholly desirable. The fact is, however, that this prospective large deficit will mean that our national debt will become exceedingly difficult to control. Aside from the economic impact of such a shortage, its psychological effect would be dangerous. It would be a signal that, despite a high level of prosperity, our mania for spending had swamped our capacity to pay. It would be a clear acknowledgment that since continuous deficits are to be the order of the day, the savings of the people are to be systematically eaten away by printing-press money.

Heavy reductions in spending are critically necessary. The 5 per cent cut now proposed would save less than $1,500,000,000. That is not enough. The hunt for economy must bag bigger game than that.
