The Western Political Outlook
by RAYMOND MOLEY

KANSAS CITY—As this long trip approaches its end, my budget of impressions, facts and opinions grows so bulky that only a few general observations can be set down here. They are:

1—Each state is a problem in itself. To get a true picture of the campaign, each local situation must be seen on the ground. I have attempted to note these local situations from week to week.

2—West of the Mississippi and north of Oklahoma, the states I visited look like this: Mr. Roosevelt is strongest in Montana, Washington and California. He is weakest in Kansas, the Dakotas, Idaho and Colorado. Dewey was ahead in Minnesota, but slipped. Oregon and Missouri are doubtful territory. Wyoming may be lost to the Democrats because of indignation aroused by the Jackson Hole National Monument. Governor Warren by a spirited campaign may well carry California for Dewey.

3—Part of the way, I was ahead of the Dewey train. Part of the way, I followed. Clearly, Mr. Dewey made an excellent impression everywhere. His conferences with local leaders and with the press were friendly and fruitful. His speeches in Seattle and Oklahoma were enthusiastically received. In San Francisco and Portland the reaction was good. In Los Angeles it was disappointing. But Mr. Dewey’s popularity in these Western states goes back to preconvention days in 1940 and is important.

4—This column does not predict, but it can record that throughout the West there was a distinct, although undefinable, trend toward Mr. Dewey up to Oct. 1. If that continues, he will carry most of it. The reason this trend is hard to define is that people are not talking much. They are profoundly interested in the war and in their own problems.

5—Except in a few spots in California and in Montana Mr. Hillman’s PAC is not very important out West. It is regarded as a New York contraption and is widely distrusted. It is as if Tammany tried to mobilize voters out here. It will lose thousands of rural and small-business votes. It is not popular in AFL circles on the Coast, and most industrial workers on

the Coast are members of the older labor organizations.

6—In general, people are interested in knowing when their boys are coming home victoriously. Next, they are thinking about jobs and the fate of small business. On the Coast, they are most concerned with the Pacific war. They want us to stay prepared after it. They are friendly to some form of postwar international cooperation, but are not talking about specific plans.

Missouri presents an interesting picture. To the west, east and north are heavily Republican states. Rural Missouri is definitely Republican. The election depends on what happens in Kansas City and St. Louis. Four years ago, St. Louis had a Democratic mayor. There was a Democratic governor. Machine power was in possession of the Democrats. Now there is a Republican governor, and a Republican mayor in St. Louis. The Pendergast machine is in small pieces, but it has regained some local jobs.

The primary fight that defeated Sen. Bennett C. Clark has left deep scars. Senator Clark is affirming his support of the Roosevelt-Truman ticket, but many of his friends are bitter and will go Republican. Mr. Truman will not help the ticket much because none of his neighbors ever thought of this amiable county politician as an understudy for a world statesman. People laugh when he talks of the indispensability of experience. If that is so, they ask, why not Garner or Wallace? Messrs. Kelly, Flynn and Hague told delegates in Chicago that Mr. Truman would carry Missouri for the ticket. They were wrong. If the Democrats carry it, it will not be by the grace of Mr. Truman.

Registration is lagging in Kansas City and St. Louis, which is bad for the Democrats. Reports from the industrial plants are that the PAC is not doing well.

In Kansas City, where Pendergast established ghost voting as a fine art, I first heard of a Republican fear that boss-controlled states and cities might tamper with soldier votes.

All in all, it is clear that it will take more than Mr. Truman to carry Missouri for the fourth term.
