**PERSPECTIVE**

**Where There Is Vision**

by RAYMOND MOLEY


ROCHESTER—Here, as in other cities with large war contracts, there is evidence of two things: first, that private enterprise is getting close to all-out war production and, second, that coordination of government purchasing and contracting is far from a reality. Perhaps what people hailed as unity when Donald Nelson was appointed is reserved for the next generation’s wars. In any case, firsthand observation encourages the hope that the war can probably be fought and won whether government coordination is achieved or not. In such cities as this the traveler has the exhilarating feeling that it can, for production is piling up now in a manner undreamed of a year ago.

The disheartening lack of unity among the agencies seeking war goods is much more apparent in the field than in Washington. Here in Rochester several divisions of the War Department as well as the Navy are placing orders and gathering their harvest in a spirit of lively though friendly rivalry. The agencies operating here head up in various cities—some in Rochester, some in Buffalo, some in Syracuse and so on. There is a WPB office with a growing staff, and there are, in addition, four civilian coordinators whose functions are not clear. Money lending by government to small business is carried on by two agencies—the WPB and the RFC—but, as in recent years, it is evident that a small business can still get money from the banks whenever a loan is justified. This enumeration is merely to suggest the bewildering number of agencies actively concerned with procurement, financing and the like, and the complications implicit in a setup of this kind.

That they are plaguing and time-consuming is evident not only from the testimony of those actually turning out war goods but from the fact that last week they elicited further efforts in Washington to eliminate them. Mr. Nelson and Under Secretary Patterson have issued a new joint “memorandum” for their subordinates, redefining the respective spheres of the WPB and the various branches of the War Department organization. Unfortunately, its import is not to change an existing status, but merely to redefine it and exhort subordinates to cut red tape wherever possible. Yet, as an interim step, there is no doubt of its usefulness. But all this sounds more slow-moving than it really is. A visit to a city like Rochester is a tonic to anyone afflicted with the discouragements that grow from a view of the war in the headlines. Here, a number of great industries, many of them bearing names that are household words over the world, are running anywhere from 50 to 100 per cent on war work. Conversion, which has been proceeding for eighteen months, is clearly past the worst stages. Unemployment is negligible and will decline rather than increase. Labor troubles are not worrying people, for Eastman, Bausch & Lomb and a number of other companies here have solved industrial relations without the interposition of unions.

Beyond this, reporting becomes a problem of censorship. Victories are being won in our plants that wipe out the sting of defeats in the headlines. Rigid censorship prevents much of this reality from reaching the public as yet. It is true that there are things in production in Rochester, as elsewhere, that should not be discussed in a publication. It is true that the government must, in a war, decide what should not reach the public. But obviously much that is precious is lost when government resolves all such decisions in favor of secrecy. And obviously censorship is making that the rule—roughly, crudely and something less than intelligently. Certainly detailed figures of production should not be published. Nor should we give the enemy a blueprint of vital spots for the use of his bombers. Nor should we reveal to him scientific developments that will help him kill Americans. But there are stories in these plants—colorful, vivid stories that would excel any speeches, broadcasts, plays or fantasies that government uses in its so-called morale building. Americans need such stories to stay them in the vigil that lies ahead while they wait for better news from the front. For the rest, about all I can say without violating the censorship is that I was in Rochester.
