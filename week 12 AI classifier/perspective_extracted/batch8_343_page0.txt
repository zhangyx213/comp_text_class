**TODAY IN AMERICA**

**By Raymond Moley**

**Golf Balls and Cement**

THE Federal Trade Commission has
been bursting with activity of late.
One day it cracks down on the cement
industry, whose uniformity of prices it
views with suspicious eye and whose
basing-point system of pricing is the
FTC bête noir. The next day it issues
a solemn complaint against the golf-
ball manufacturers who, it seems, have
been grinding the faces of the poor
through a nefarious conspiracy with
Sandy, the club "pro."

It may be argued that these inci-
dents are part of a logical pattern of
policy. Monopoly allegedly means price
extortion, and the Administration is
properly concerned lest the inflation
which it deliberately started should get
out of hand. It has already used many
weapons to fight against too swift a
rise of prices. Not the least effective
was the White House statement which
pricked the bubble of commodity specu-
lation here and in London. Bank re-
serve requirements have twice been
raised to minimize the possibilities of
credit expansion. The Treasury is ster-
ilizing incoming shipments of gold
which otherwise would pass into the
banking system and cancel the effect of
the stiffer reserve requirements. As a
minor phase of the campaign, the Se-
curities and Exchange Commission is
harrying the stock market sufficiently
to discourage any great amount of
plunging.

So far so good: all this does make a
pattern. But what of the rest of the
Administration's program? What of
the Administration's determination to
better wage and hour standards through
Federal legislation? What of its spon-
sorship of the Wagner Labor Relations
Act, which has encouraged the growth
of the C.I.O.? These things, regardless
of whether or not they are desirable in
themselves, go far to cancel the at-
tempt to moderate the rise in prices.
Rising labor costs are one of the most
powerful levers which jack up prices.
And if it be argued that the Adminis-
tration proposes to keep prices down
and make up the increase in labor's
pay roll out of profits, there is plenty of
statistical evidence to show this is im-
possible. The Twentieth Century Fund's
newly published study of corporate
profits, "How Profitable is Big Busi-
ness?" provides the most recent data.
Here, then, is the picture: the Ad-
ministration is trying to put the brakes
on prices; prices, in turn, are rising

partly because the Administration is
continuing its inflationary spending and
borrowing; and, as though that were
not bewildering enough, the Adminis-
tration is doing everything in its power
to raise labor costs—a course which is
bound to result in higher prices.
But that is not the end of incon-
sistency. Most of the utterances of the
Administration since 1933 have shown
an enmity toward bigness in business
and a nostalgia for the America of
small, competing proprietors. There is
a whole line of legislation stemming
from these feelings, and the Federal
Trade Commission's recent activity ob-
viously has the same motivation.

Yet NRA, one of the New Deal's
cornerstones, was designed to mitigate
the deflationary effects of intense com-
petition. Whether NRA might later
have shifted from that course, is any-
one's guess. But as it worked, it fa-
vored bigness. It was economic plan-
ning, implying a world of highly or-
ganized economic groups and a gov-
ernment supervising their collective
forms of action. And the Administra-
tion's continued devotion to that basic
idea may be read in the descendants of
the NRA—the Black-Connery Bill to
regulate wages and hours, the Wagner
Act, and the Guffey Act. These meas-
ures spell the concentration of economic
power.

The emergency is over. There is
time, now, to sit down and think things
through. Certainly nothing can be
gained by continued inconsistency:
nothing but an embarrassing fall can
come from an attempt to ride with one
foot on the dashboard of a buggy and
the other on the accelerator of a high-
speed automobile. Unless the whole
economic policy as it relates to prices,
wages and the industrial set-up is
brought into harmonious relationship,
the Administration must fail to achieve
its humane objectives.

The test, it seems to me, should be
whether wages provide a decent stand-
ard of living and whether prices are
reasonable. In broader terms, the
criterion is whether our system is en-
couraging the maximum production
and consumption of goods, which is to
say, wealth. I very much doubt if the
average American cares whether effi-
ciency, fair wages and reasonable prices
are achieved by big or little business.
As a matter of fact, he believes the
small businessman still has ample op-
portunity; he knows the majority of
big businesses were little not so long
ago, as John Allen Murphy points

out in Harper's Magazine for June.
But if we are going to proceed on the
assumption, held by a number of Bran-
deisians high in Administration coun-
cils, that the nation would be healthier
if bigness were destroyed, let us recog-
nize that high wages and inefficient
production cost money. They must be
covered by rising prices.

**Shake-Up**

BURIED by the more spectacular news
of last week was an event of first-
rate importance to the peace of this
country—a major shake-up of State
Department personnel. Long due, it is
said to be a consequence of confidential
studies made at the direction of the
President, who has been well aware of
the fact that incompetence in our State
Department and Foreign Service in-
vites embroilment in foreign wars.

Most significant of last week's trans-
fers is that of Wilbur J. Carr to the
post of Minister to Czechoslovakia. For
more than ten years Mr. Carr was the
Assistant Secretary of State charged
with the administration of the State
Department and the Foreign Service.
He was the legislative, budget and fis-
cal officer, chairman of the Board of
Foreign Service Personnel, member of
the Board of Examiners for the Foreign
Service, of the Foreign Service Officers
Training School Board and of the Board
of Appeals and Review. While the
officials superior in rank to Mr. Carr
changed from time to time, he re-
mained in his position of unique power,
and his influence on transfers, promo-
tions and policy grew with the years.

His duties will now be taken over by
George S. Messersmith, former Min-
ister to Austria, who, like Hugh R. Wil-
son, the new Assistant Secretary of
State in charge of European affairs, is
one of the ablest career men in the De-
partment. Both are the working type
of professional diplomatist, easily dis-
tinguishable from the many "cookie
pushers" who flourish in the Service.
Both are extremely well informed on
European affairs and will help to infuse
into the Department at Washington,
where important decisions are always
made, a more sensitive awareness of
what is going on across the Atlantic.
Both are impatient with those men
representing us abroad who are long on
social graces and short on knowledge
of the economic and social currents
which shape events. A shake-up in the
lower grades of the Foreign Service is
in prospect as soon as Messersmith and
Wilson take over.

With these two men in Washington,
the State Department becomes stronger
than it has been since Secretary Hughes
left it twelve years ago. Americans
have reason to feel that the President
has made a real contribution to their
safety and well-being.
