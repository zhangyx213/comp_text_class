**Knight's Predicament**

by Raymond Moley

LOS ANGELESâ€”Gov. Goodwin J. Knight is known in many centers of deep thinking as a smart politician. In support of this opinion is the fact that he has attained the governorship with none of the breaks or gaudy incidents that have thrust greatness upon politicians of the past. His progress is due solely to a patient permeation of the state with smiling good humor, and tireless, folksy oratory and to a fortunate avoidance of those expressions of complex thought so repugnant to the generality of voters. His substantial eminence as a vote-getter is what induced the President and the Attorney General in 1953 to whisk Earl Warren out of Knight's path and into the seat once warmed by John Marshall.

But once in the governor's office, Knight listened to certain voices that have been murmuring over this state and the nation. They told him that he must, like the President, be "modern," not traditional, and that since there were more registered Democrats than Republicans, he must win their affections at all costs. In California the Democratic Party is dominated by certain politically minded union chieftains, and so Knight cast a well-baited line with his left hand toward them. He realized that this would lose him Republican friends, but it seemed to him then that there were, by way of compensation, more than a million and a half union members, mostly Democrats, who would bless his name. All appeared favorable to this strategy, until the grim figure of William F. Knowland loomed in his pathway.

**WARNING FROM HISTORY**

Now the extent to which Knight's flirtation with the union leaders has alienated his own party has flared into public notice. A poll under the auspices of *The Los Angeles Times* indicates that there is a preference of two to one among Republicans for Knowland over Knight.

There are also the haunting pages of history, wherein it is told that only two governors in our century, Hiram Johnson and Warren, have succeeded themselves. After Johnson went to the Senate, a Republican succeeded him who was beaten by a Republican, who was ousted by a Republican, who was eliminated by a Republican, who died. Then a Republican was elected, who was beaten by a Democrat who was ousted by Warren. Knight is neither a Johnson nor a Warren. This is a political *danse macabre* terrifying enough to panic any governor.

C.J. Haggerty, secretary-treasurer of the State Federation of Labor and a Knight supporter, proposed, after conferring with the governor, that union members, presently Democrats, change their registration to Republican and invade the Republican primary *en masse* next year.

It is important to note here that the crazy California primary law has been partially revised. Now only registered Republicans may vote the Republican ticket and only Democrats may vote their ticket. Hitherto it was wide open. Candidates, however, may cross-file. But if Knight cross-files and wins on the Democratic side but loses on the Republican, he is out. For only a candidate who carries his own primary may run at election.

**ROUGH FIGHT AHEAD**

And so all of Knight's earnest sowing of seed in the union-controlled Democratic Party, and all of his protestations to the cause of "modern" Republicanism, and all of his concessions and promises to union leaders will yield him nothing unless he is able to accomplish one of two labors which would frustrate a Hercules. Either he must convince reluctant Republicans that he didn't mean all he has said to the union leaders, or he and Haggerty must persuade, guide, and instruct tens of thousands of Democratic union members to change their registration to Republican. I suggest that it would be far simpler for Knight to betake himself to the appropriate authority and change his own registration from Republican to Democrat. Morse accomplished that in Oregon without missing a speech.

Knight will make a bitter fight. Kyle Palmer, a sage political commentator, says the carnage will be fearful. In the war to come: "We ordinary mortals will take our appointed places, either as participants or spectators. Some, undoubtedly, will take to the tall woods, and even our children will shudder as they hear the tale."
