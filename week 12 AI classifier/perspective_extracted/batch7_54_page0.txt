**Dewey Enlists Once More**

by RAYMOND MOLEY

THOMAS E. DEWEY'S decision to run
again for governor was an entirely
unselfish act. Nearly twenty years of
most exacting public life, marked from
time to time by bitter disappointment,
take their toll. Dewey was tired and
ready to be done with official life. For
many months, a painful shoulder ailment
dogged him. He has finished with the
power and the glory of the
governorship, and only hard
work lies ahead. Most important, he
realized that with the age of 50 just
before him and rust accumulated on a
profession neglected for nearly twenty
years, it would not be easy to
accumulate a needed
competence in private practice. After
four more years, it will be twice as hard.
And he cannot hopefully look forward
to another Presidential nomination.

We must take his explanation at
full value. With the Washington ship
of state rocking in a sea of incompetence and confusion, and with the
most formidable enemy we have ever
known poised to strike, the state of
the nation is grave indeed. The city
and the state of New York offer the
fairest targets for deadly attack. If
ever experienced and able administration has been needed, it is here and
now. And Dewey, perhaps alone in
this state, has that to offer his country.
The need for Dewey in the four
years ahead is underlined by the
wretched state of New York Democrats.
Among them, despite the grim
challenge of events, there rules politics
as usual-or a little more than usual.

A MONTH ago, above a surface of
subterfuge there appeared the
pattern of a carefully laid piece of
political strategy. Mayor O'Dwyer, a
decent person and a popular mayor,
had suffered a heart attack in the
middle of his first term. He was told
that if he sharply curtailed his work,
he could carry on. When the end of
his term approached, he announced
quite sincerely that he would not run
again. Then the bosses, fearful of losing his great vote-drawing power, after
weeks of pressure got him to change
his plans. He ran and dragged through
the whole ticket, including Herbert
Lehman for U.S. senator. It is a fair
inference that the deal was to let
O'Dwyer out later through a nice
Truman appointment. And so, after
the Mexican mission was announced,
all looked rosy for another big New
York Democratic victory, since Dewey
was not to run. The bosses could put
up pliant people for mayor, governor,
and U.S. senator and win easily. And
the leaders of the boroughs, plus State
Chairman Fitzpatrick, were
happy in the anticipation of
vast patronage in the great
city and in the state.

But things went badly
even before Dewey blasted
their plans by his decision to
run. The leaders selected a
reputable but little-known
judge from Brooklyn, Albert
Conway, to run for governor,
and the exceedingly willing
Judge Pecora for mayor. But the CIO-
PAC denounced Conway, and the
leaders and Conway retreated in
panic. Then the chairman was reported to be soliciting the permission
of the CIO-PAC to run someone else.
The leaders could not drop Pecora,
because the splinter Liberal Party
wanted him. Hence, the once-proud
Democratic Party was placed in position of subservience to the two marginal groups they must have to win.

FINALLY, they decided upon a Bronx
congressman, Walter A. Lynch, as
their candidate for governor. Lynch is
practically unknown outside his district. A very notable Democrat said at
the Rochester convention: "If Lynch
walked through this hotel lobby, not
two people would know him." His
record in Congress is that of almost
unbelievable obedience to the dictates of Roosevelt and Truman. There
isn't a single piece of constructive
action in twelve years of his servitude.
He is the bosses' dream-except that
he can't possibly win. Perhaps the
bosses know that and hope now to salvage only the city from the wreckage.
This is wretched business in a moment when the future of the country
is in the balance. But it is nothing more
than the extension in a state of what
politics has done in the Federal Administration. The shades of Tilden,
Cleveland, and Al Smith could be restless witnesses of what has come to the
party which they knew long, long ago.
