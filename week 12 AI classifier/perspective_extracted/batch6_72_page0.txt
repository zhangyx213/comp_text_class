**Ohio, An Industrial Empire**
by Raymond Moley

If you were to stand on the lake front in Cleveland one of these spring days, you would find a deep fascination in the endless succession of long ships, riding deep, moving toward Lake Erie ports. The cargoes of these ships are pouring into an industrial complex in which boundless optimism is the spirit of the moment. And great expectations are wholly justified by the economic and political facts.

Prosperity is no new experience for Ohio. In the 1860s and 1870s oil flowing from wells in Pennsylvania and eastern Ohio made Cleveland the chief refinery of the nation and brought to a daring young man named Rockefeller the beginnings of a fabulous fortune. Cleveland and other harbors on the Great Lakes became the ports of entry for vast treasures of iron ore from the Mesabi and other fields near the upper lakes. This ore, with limestone from Michigan and coking coal from the Appalachians, created a broad industrial band which stretches from Buffalo to Pittsburgh and Wheeling, and to Gary and Chicago. That area became an industrial Ruhr, dwarfing its European counterpart.

In recent years any one of three ports in Ohio—Cleveland, Ashtabula, and Conneaut—have unloaded as much iron ore as the combined capacity of Germany, Japan, and Italy at the beginning of the second world war. Today the combined unloadings at these ports are greater than the capacity of Russia and all its satellites.

For a few years grave apprehensions lurked in the minds of businessmen in northern Ohio. Years of intensive mining to meet the needs of war had eaten away the Mesabi and other sources of high-grade ore. Then relief came with the opening of new sources in Labrador and the final approval of the St. Lawrence Seaway. Ohio stands to gain first and probably most from the new avenue.

Today Ohio ranks second to New York in manufacturing. The state turns out a large share of the nation’s supply of iron and steel, rubber products, automotive parts, industrial machinery, machine tools, and construction and mining equipment. Its schools and colleges train great numbers of the technicians and managers required in industry.

Long ago there were indications that Ohio might be the center of the automobile industry. But Michigan, for a number of reasons, forged ahead. Now, however, there is evidence that the tide is returning. Cleveland boasts a new Ford foundry and engine assembly plant, the largest in the world, and immense General Motors plants. A Chrysler plant is building at Twinsburg. Since the outbreak of the second world war, Cincinnati has experienced an orderly expansion. Automotive, aircraft, and electrical plants have moved into Cincinnati to join the old, well-managed companies that made the city “solid.” Akron thrives still as the “rubber capital of the world.”

Aluminum manufacturing is building in the Ohio Valley, with plants by Kaiser and Olin Mathieson. A substantial chemical industry is growing along Lake Erie near Ashtabula where there is a fruitful combination of fresh, cold water, salt, and silica plus accessible limestone, electric power, and transportation facilities.

A very important political factor has encouraged expansion and drawn industry to Ohio, notably in the two decades in which the CIO has become a political force in other states. Most of Ohio’s major industrial cities have had good and conservative government. Cincinnati has had not only good but reform government for several years. Cleveland has had excellent mayors for twenty years.

The state has had conservative governors since the election of John Bricker in 1938. Frank Lausche is serving his fifth term. Lausche has been plain evidence to all that there will be no capture of the state’s government by the CIO such as has befallen the state of Michigan. There is no reason why industry will not flow to regions where there is some assurance of immunity from class government. This political climate will have its effect for years to come. All Ohioans will benefit—those who work and those who invest alike.
