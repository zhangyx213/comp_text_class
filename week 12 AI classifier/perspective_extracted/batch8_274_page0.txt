**Into the Fog**

Senator O'Mahoney's reassurances concerning the objectives and methods of the work of the monopoly committee are admirable. There will be no rush to spread political propaganda before the election; the inquiry is to be wholly objective and will try to do its part toward dissipating the fog of uncertainty and ignorance that characterizes public opinion on most economic questions; it will be leisurely; every effort will be made to exorcize the spirit of witch hunting. Of all this, Senator O'Mahoney assures us.

An inquiry such as the Senator describes would be of inestimable value if it got no further than to reveal the dire inadequacy of our economic knowledge. The fact is that most of our economic terms are vague and indefinite, and the committee will probably be confronted at the outset by the necessity of working out new definitions for economic concepts. In this respect it will be like a professor who starts to give a course in a language for which there is no textbook and no dictionary.

This can be illustrated by the most superficial examination of a few economic concepts selected at random. Take that of "living standards." Some people say that standards of living are going down. Others contend the opposite. But what is meant by a standard of living? Perhaps it might be said that in the past year the American standard of living has been going down in the matter of clothing and automobiles, but that it has been rising so far as streets and roads are concerned. It has been declining in housing, but it has been rising in public buildings. We may ride in a dilapidated car, but we roll over improved roads. We pass through the door and across the creaking porch of an old house, but we seek justice in a palatial courthouse. We may need a new carpet at home, but instead we are getting a new stone lining for the brook that runs past the house. We might like to add a room to the third floor, but taxes are up because the trees are being counted in the park. Collectively we grow richer. Individually we grow poorer. This is probably true in most of the countries of the world where the general government gets the better of the old individualist. And it is not my purpose to raise the question of whether this is right. It is merely to say that when we talk of living standards we mean a great many different things.

We hear many speeches by government officials about the evils of monopoly and the need for protecting competition. But the idea of an economy composed solely of freely competing little fellows is hardly more than a mystical theory, although it is a theory upon which such legislation as the Robinson-Patman Act was erected. This principle seems to hold that competition exists as an institution, a thing to be measured, increased, decreased or restored. Mr. Arnold, for example, loves to speak of the virtues of competition, but he also speaks of what he considers the shameful economic waste of competing filling stations and proposes a public-utility type of regulation for them. This must mean that Mr. Arnold conceives it to be possible for someone to calculate the perfect proportion of gasoline vendors in the United States and desirable, through regulation, to reduce the number of filling stations or regiment them, if you will. But if that happens, what becomes of the ideal of free, independent enterprise?

A year ago, or a little less, it was a grand thing for an employer to keep his workmen around the place as long as he could, making up goods for future orders. Today that's wrong. We see it clearly now, or we do after listening to Mr. Arnold. That was piling up inventory! Choking inventories, he said, were at the bottom of "the recent (sic) depression." On the other hand, Mr. Arnold also talks darkly of "the power of advertising," which, he implies, is something that the little fellow can't compete against and something that the ultimate producer and ultimate consumer could just as well get along without. Or too much advertising, that is: too ardent an attempt on the part of large manufacturers to market their products.

In short, manufacturers are condemned for accumulating inventories, and they are also condemned for strenuous efforts to market their products. The assumption is, of course, that government can maintain a nice balance between the two extremes. But how can this regulation be achieved unless some determination is made as to what an inventory may be intended to do and what the size of an inventory should be in relation to a given article?

Mr. Arnold further makes the point that the government should compel big business to force its prices down and aid little business to increase prices. Mr. John T. Flynn answers with this shrewd comment:

"Now, how is Mr. Arnold going to enable little businessmen to raise prices? The government is not going to fix prices and compel everyone to pay those prices. No one believes that will happen. What other method is left? There is only one. The government is going to help to organize the little businessmen to enable them to get together to do what the big businessmen are forbidden to do. But how can the government do that? There is now on the statute books an antitrust law which forbids such agreements. And it forbids them whether they are made by big businessmen or little businessmen.

"Is Mr. Arnold going to attempt to bring about a repeal of the antitrust laws as applied to little businessmen or is he going just to ignore the laws and encourage little businessmen to make these unlawful agreements?"

Presumably our old friend the business cycle will be up for a hearing. This could be a fruitful field of inquiry on the part of the committee if only because some of the attempts of the government to flatten out the business curve have had the effect of accentuating it. For example, if we assume the position of the government, that the depression beginning in 1937 was caused by circumstances other than governmental interference, it nevertheless remains true that the government started to put on the brakes at the exact time that the car began to slow down, and that caused a violent jolt. Quite a time passed before the government decided to accelerate by spending, but the acceleration was bound to be slow in taking effect, and we may find that the effects of government spending will coincide with a natural revival of business. This may produce a violent upswing.

In other words, the question of timing is of vital importance and, unless the government can anticipate natural movements with more accuracy than it has in the past, its assumption of responsibility for preventing things from taking their natural course will only accentuate the ups and downs of the business curve. Either this, or government will have to learn how to apply restoratives vastly more rapidly than it is now able to do. Either of these courses raises economic questions about which we are appallingly ignorant.

All of this is to suggest two things that the committee may well do in its first year or so. It can lay the basis of a more accurate method of describing economic phenomena and it can make a thoroughly impartial survey of the attempts of government, to date, to regulate business policies. These objectives will be pretty difficult to attain. But, if they are not attained, the committee will only compound the economic confusions in which we are now weltering.
