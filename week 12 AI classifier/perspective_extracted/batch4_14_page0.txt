**Japan's Party Politics**
by Raymond Moley

IN THE elections of governors, mayors, and prefectural assemblies in the local divisions of Japan on April 23, the Liberal-Democratic Party won decisive victories. Most important was the party's retention of control in Tokyo, Osaka, and Yokohama and its rescue of the big northern island of Hokkaido from the Socialists. This will greatly strengthen and encourage the government and party of Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi as it now faces the election of one-half of the Upper House of the Diet in June.

This is good news for the United States, for the Liberal-Democrats are extremely friendly to us and are strongly anti-Communist.

It is also good news for the peaceful and orderly people in Tokyo. For under the clumsy, antiquated police system imposed by the American occupation, the election of a Socialist governor of the capital would be a threat to the stability and security of the central government. There are plenty of subversive elements in the great city, and gangsterism and juvenile crime are definite problems.

Japan's parliamentary system follows the British form; local government before the Pacific war followed the French pattern, while the new constitution introduced some American forms of decentralized authority. It is amazing that the Japanese have assimilated this mixture so well.

**LEADERSHIP AND RECOVERY**

There is nominally a two-party system, with reasonable party responsibility on the Liberal-Democratic side. The Communists as a distinct party are insignificant, since most of them have moved in among the Socialists and in the labor unions.

The Liberal-Democratic Party is in essence conservative, favoring capitalism and active trade with the U.S. It took shape and principles under leadership of Shigeru Yoshida. Just as in our Republican Party, there are shades of opinion about social-welfare activities and foreign policies. There are also several leaders who would like Prime Minister Kishi's job. But the party offers strong, consistent leadership which has facilitated a marvelous economic recovery.

About the only specific thing that can be said of the Socialists is that they are in opposition. In a long conversation with a moderate Socialist leader, I sought to analyze what the Socialist Party really stands for. He and other Socialists give lip service to Marxism. But there is an infinite variety of views as to what Socialism should do if it had power. Using as a guide the program of the British Labor Party, I questioned this man item by item as to what he would favor as government policy. He would nationalize the central bank and electricity, but not wholly take over transport, which is now partly public and partly private. Steel, he would not touch. He would extend some social services but not nearly so far as the British Socialists. I elicited an admission from him that farmers are "capitalists" and want to stay so.

**ANTI-COMMUNIST SUPPORT**

So far as American relations are concerned, he said that if the Socialists gained ascendancy and were anti-United States, the people would throw them out in six months. It is clear that the Socialists are hardly a party at all, but a conglomerate group of leaders with no common aim or philosophy. I also drew the inference that this man was not anxious to see his party get a majority in the Diet because it has no program and no responsible leadership.

One Socialist leader, Inejiro Asanuma, who holds the title of Chief-Secretary, after receiving the full Communist treatment in Peking in March, came out with a vicious anti-American statement. This raised furious dissents in his own party.

From a very authentic source I gathered specific accounts of large sums of money which Red China has been pouring into Communist-front, radical, and "cultural" organizations. There is plenty of appeasement talk in the air, from Europeans and Americans, from the Japanese unions, and from so-called intellectuals. But we can feel sure that public opinion supports a government that is stable and will stand firmly at our side against Communism. Working together, the United States and Japan can hold the line in Southeast Asia. Neither can do it alone.
