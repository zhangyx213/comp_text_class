**Perspective**

**Birth of a Lame Duck**

by RAYMOND MOLEY

Foremost in any assessment of 1942 politics to date is the speech that Congressman Luther Patrick of Birmingham, Ala., made last week. Luther Patrick came to Congress six years ago. Three weeks before this year’s primary in Alabama he went home, anticipating no trouble.  "I was licked," he says, "before I got home." Indeed he was— compellingly, definitively, finally. A lame duck was born, who last week picked himself up and told the House about the genetics of lame ducks. Patrick was a pretty good New Deal congressman. But it will be writ of him that nothing he ever did in Congress was so worthy as his manner of taking leave of it. Good judges in Congress agree that his speech tells more about what faces candidates in the election this year than a dozen polls or homilies on politics.

Congressmen running for reelection, Patrick declares, are going to be up against a state of unrest all the more baffling because of its vagueness. "The people feel that vital information they are entitled to have is being withheld by this Congress. They do not know what it is, to be sure, but they are uneasy,...even resentful."

With cool detachment Patrick then describes the avalanche of questions that snowed him under. "What about you fellows being asleep at the switch when the Japs hit us?" his people asked. "Why did you not have fighting planes and trained men ready when war came?" "What about Leon Henderson?" ("Now, how are you going to answer a question like that?" Patrick asks his colleagues.) "What about that Congressional pension...?" "What about gasoline rationing...?" "Why haven't you brought more industries into our district?" And when Patrick attempted to answer that he could not because his district was a potential bomb target, they retorted: "It's your duty to keep it from being a war target." "Why did not Congress do something about heading off this rubber shortage?" "When are you going to settle down to a tax program that we can depend upon?" "When are we going to invade the Continent of Europe?"

So the questions rolled on—angry questions—enough of them to indicate that congressmen are going to get kicked around not only for the sins they committed but for a lot of things they couldn’t possibly help.

Conclusion Number Two is almost as important. Patrick discussed it in detail. When he arrived home, he said, people asked where he had been all this time. "Why have you not been around to see us?" they asked. "Have you gone high-hat, have you gone national?" Patrick said he had been working. "Well," they told him, "there is no law against your coming down to see us once in a while." Congress, except for a 60-day recess, has been in almost continuous session for 45 months. It is too long, Patrick reminded his colleagues, since they have heard the heartbeat of their communities. And this is a bad year for Enoch Ardens.

Patrick had a personal failing that hurt him too. He has a ready tongue. He had been a radio commentator and, once in Congress, he found speaking over the radio occasionally a kind of recreation. He took no pay for it, but people grumbled. One day he made a bad break on the air. He said, "You know how it is with congressmen. We vote a bill out today, and then buy a paper tomorrow to see what it is about." "I thought it was a pretty clever joke," Patrick confessed to his colleagues, "but it did not sound so funny [to the home folks]”—particularly when his opposition played a recording of this wise-crack over and over in his district. The people love clever men, but they don’t vote for them. In Patrick’s case the Lord gave a sense of humor; and the people took away—a seat in Congress. Yet if humor is not a typical failing of congressmen, there is still a conclusion all of them can draw. These are deadly serious times. Don’t try to fool with people.

Conclusion Number Four is implied, rather than stated. To stiffen its spine and do what needs doing domestically now, might, in the end, be a better kind of politics for this Congress than to go on backing, filling and postponing for fear the electorate will not be able to "take it."

There may not be a great change in the parties’ numerical strength this year, but there will be many an upset in the primaries. The people are mad. Luther Patrick found that out.
