**Column 1 (primarily the Hoover article):**

THE dissent from Herbert Hoover's
statement of foreign policy, ex-
pressed by Washington spokesmen for
the Administration and by some East-
ern newspapers, should not blind us to
the fact that he was speaking the
minds of millions of Americans. Nor
should the shock occasioned in Eu-
rope by Hoover disturb us, because
it will take some plain speaking to
awaken the nations over
there to their deadly peril.
It is not only incorrect but
very dangerous to call the
Hoover plan isolationism. A
foreign policy that proposes
an area of American power,
from the North Sea to the
Sea of Japan and from the
North to the South Pole,
cannot be called burying
our heads in the sand.
Moreover, Hoover, in making this
proposal, has unquestionably contrib-
uted to the prevention of a wave of
hysteria in the United States which
might mean real isolationism within
this continent alone.
Nor is Hoover speaking in terms of
pacifism. His program involves activat-
ing and enlarging our great navy and
immensely increasing our Air Force,
as well as creating a powerful army.

UNLIKE many people in the Admin-
istration, Hoover takes his stand
solidly against appeasement of Red
China and the Soviet. Neither a mili-
tary danger nor a diplomatic hope
justifies any concessions now to the
Red government of China.
Furthermore, there is no suggestion
in Hoover's proposal that we abandon
the world outside our established
lines of defense to Communism. His
proposal is that, before we wander
vaguely in pursuit of various "points,"
including Point Four, we take note of
what should be called Point One. And
that is to make sure beyond all doubt
that we are strong within the area
described and that we waste none
of our power in peripheral defenses
which in sound military judgment we
cannot defend. To weaken ourselves
through indiscriminate adventures is
to make of ourselves a poor protector
when genuine needs arise.
There have been comments to
the effect that Hoover has made the
Eisenhower mission more difficult.

ALL these efforts abroad, as well as
our task of mobilization at home,
are challenges that we cannot ignore.
They are certainly not beyond our
capacity, but they are not far short
of our capacity as a sound nation.

**Column 2 (Hoover article continued):**

This is hardly a sound conclusion. In
any event, Eisenhower faces a prob-
lem of morale, rather than of military
mobilization. That is why his talents
are so admirably suited to his new
task. He revealed diplomatic talents
in the recent war that almost over-
shadowed his capacity as a military
strategist. Hoover's warning may well
be a strong weapon for Eisenhower.
The general can say with-
out committing himself that
Hoover was speaking the
opinion of a large part of
America and that Ameri-
can commitments must be
matched by genuine power
and cooperation on the Con-
tinent of Europe. Sometimes
a good shock is needed to
awaken a will to fight.
Three aspects of Hoover's
speech are immediate challenges both
to Congress and to the President.
Japan must be our western defense
anchor. We must trust Japan to rearm
herself and quickly. More considera-
tion of the difficulty and potential
importance of the Emperor's position
should be the concern both of the
President and of General MacArthur.
We should at once conclude a treaty
of peace, of mutual assistance, and
alliance with Japan.
The eastern anchor of our concern
is Britain. The British government and
people must be brought to see that
their part in European defense is
vastly more important than Hong
Kong and the remaining, crumbling
portions of British Asia.
Finally, Hoover made clear the
fatal vulnerability of an overextended
Communist empire. The Red China
regime advances its borders in weak-
ness rather than in strength. Its efforts
to push into southeast Asia extend its
capacities to the breaking point. There
are hundreds of thousands of Asiatics
behind the Red lines who can be
more and more activated by the virus
of revolt. We must fight with the
underground there as well as in the
Communist satellites in Europe.
