**Perspective**

**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

**The Grass Roots Widow**

As Republicans assemble next week to celebrate the birthday of Lincoln, they face a grave party crisis.  Their decisions in the immediate future on "all out" aid to Britain may have far-reaching effects upon their strength and influence. But the root of their problem is what attitude to take about their recent Presidential candidate, Mr. Willkie.

To understand the attitude of a number of the leading figures of the party we must recognize the age-old dualism of the obligations that party relationship involves. There is the obligation of a party leader to defer to the opinion of his party associates. And there is the obligation of a man to speak his mind on public questions with no restriction except his individual sense of the public interest. It is not hard to see that two ethical codes are here involved. At times it is difficult to harmonize them. Some men have resolved the conflict by quitting their party. Others have chosen to fight out the issue within the party. Still others have chosen to try, quietly and patiently, to bring as much agreement with their views within the party as is possible. Despite Mr. Willkie's outspoken challenge, any one of these courses may still be open to him. His speech to the Women's National Republican Club before he left for England hinted that he might follow the second course.

Meanwhile, it is understatement to say that the outstanding Republican leaders feel that Mr. Willkie has not performed as a minority leader should perform. They assert that the duty of an opposition is to present before the bar of public opinion legitimate criticism of the party in power, and that such a presentation is essential to the making of wise judgments by the jury of public opinion. Thus they suggest the analogy of a law court—an analogy that the opposition in England has always observed. Mr. Willkie's Republican critics say that, in effect, he took on the job of advocate for the "loyal" opposition. They say that he has not done that job.

On the other hand, many Republicans who are impatient with party procedures commend Mr. Willkie's courage and outspokenness. They say that he perceived a national peril and rose above party to back the President. Ultimately, they believe, he will be the leader whom most of the Republican rank and file will follow. And they are convinced that, as a personal leader with a strong independent following, he may either force one or the other party to nominate him in 1944, or lead an independent ticket that year.

In the end, it will be public opinion, rather than a party decision, that determines the party's attitude. But one fact is already clear. The memory of the dilemma Mr. Willkie's stand has created will, for years, be a barrier to the nomination of an outsider by either party.

The GOP has played many sad roles, but never before, as the great cartoonist Fitzpatrick suggests, has it been cast as Madame Butterfly.


**Whose Aims?**

Mr. Willkie, in line with his desire to get at firsthand the various points of view represented in the British Government had a session with leaders of the British Labor party last week. After a meeting of the Trades Union Congress, he was reported by the International News Service to have said: "I found myself in complete agreement with their aspirations. I have not had a meeting in Britain more stimulating. Those guys are wonderful. That TUC meeting was a perfect example of Britain's war aims—to free laboring men and women throughout the world." The Associated Press reports him as saying that he was impressed by the attitude of British workmen: "There was not one dissenting voice, and I was assured the same applied throughout the trade-union movement." The United Press reports this statement: "It was one of the finest meetings I have attended in Britain. I am in complete agreement with their aims and aspirations."

Of course, we have no account of just what the labor leaders told Mr. Willkie about their aims. But one of the men with whom Mr. Willkie talked on the same day was Mr. Harold Laski, who has a wide acquaintance with New Dealers over here and who is the most articulate of all Labor party members. It was reported that Mr. Laski and Mr. Willkie discussed "war aims."

Mr. Laski's ideas on this subject are not secret. They have, in fact, been published in this country. In a book, "Where Do We Go From Here?", Mr. Laski says: "We have reached a revolutionary phase in the history of our civilization because the character of our political institutions contradicts the possibilities of our economic achievement."

This war is more than a war, Mr. Laski asserts: it is a potential revolution. "Nothing less than a revolution in the spirit of man is necessary," he says, "if we are to enter the kingdom of peace as our rightful inheritance; and a revolution in the spirit of man, as all history goes to show, must follow, and cannot precede, a revolution in the relationships of that material world by the exploitation of which he must live."

The "power of capitalism, as a universal system, to expand," Mr. Laski insists, "has now clearly reached its term. That is why this war has come upon us." He announces that "our opportunity at this moment to begin our revolution by consent is so unique" that not to take it would be "a betrayal," on the part of the British labor leaders, "of one of the supreme occasions of history. It is, indeed," he says, "the kind of moment that Lenin knew in the Russian Revolution when he called upon his comrades to inaugurate the new social order."

Such attempts to translate the aims of a minority into the aims of a whole nation at war have been made more than once. And so, too, have attempts been made to induce another nation to throw its weight behind the minority in a domestic struggle of this sort. But Americans—especially American labor—would do well to ponder the question whether they would like to have their nation put into that position—the position of interference in the internal affairs of another people. And since Mr. Laski has made his objectives clear, Americans might ask themselves at the same time whether they have any wish to produce in America the kind of revolution he urges in England.

Whatever form our comradeship with England may assume, we may well make sure that none of our national principles will be compromised by that association. Great social changes may come in England. That is a matter for England to determine for itself. But we shall hold fast to our own ways of interpreting democracy. Lincoln suggested that "if there is anything which it is the duty of the whole people never to entrust to any hands but our own, that thing is the preservation and perpetuation of our liberties and institutions."

All this is quite apart from our desire to help England frustrate Hitler. And any effort to confuse that desire with the intention of joining hands in a social and economic revolution is apt to create a devastating misunderstanding at this time. Mr. Willkie will doubtless recognize the very clear distinctions involved as he thinks over Mr. Laski's views on his return trip.
