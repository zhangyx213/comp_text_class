**Machiavelli Reconsidered**

by Raymond Moley

FLORENCE—Last week I suggested that the sinister connotations which have grown around the name of Niccolò Machiavelli need reconsideration in the light of his life, his personal character, and his writings other than "The Prince." He has been condemned, not for what he was, but for what he saw. "The Prince" was a brutally realistic portrayal of the cruel, corrupt politics of the Renaissance. It was not what Machiavelli believed to be right, or sound, or permanent. His personal convictions and ideals are in his masterpiece, the "Discourses on Livy," a book which absorbed the greater part of his ten years of exile.

In a famous letter to a friend, Machiavelli described the life he was leading in those years on his small farm near Florence. In the morning he busied himself with his farm work, cutting wood and bargaining for its sale. Then he went to the village inn and talked and played "flush or trick-track" with villagers. In the evening at home he removed the rough garments of the day and, attired in the garb he had worn before kings and princes, he turned to his books and his writing. With the ancient authors, chiefly Roman and Greek historians, he was more at home than with his contemporaries. "I am welcomed kindly and fed on that fare which is mine alone, and for which I was born; where I am not ashamed to address them and to ask the reasons for their actions."

**A FREE REPUBLIC**

The net of this reading, these reflections, and the memories of his public life is in the "Discourses." His theme was the Roman Republic before the Caesars.

In this revival of interest in the ancient world Machiavelli reveals himself as one of the foremost creators of the Renaissance. In art and literature, Greek and early Roman models were major influences, the great masterpieces showing a blend of ecclesiastical subjects with the forms of paganism. Machiavelli used Roman examples in the art of politics.

The "Discourses" is not a systemic treatise but a long series of essays on specific items of Roman political practice, with his own comment on their meaning to his time. He portrays the means by which the state can be stabilized and the liberty of its citizens preserved. Over and above that, Machiavelli stresses republican government, his belief that its internal strength rests upon the stable ground of the virility and virtues of its citizens, that citizens should be allowed to criticize their government, that a citizen soldiery is best, and that those charged with official authority should be restrained by law. Despite the advice given in "The Prince," he states his belief that the people could more safely be entrusted with power than a dictator or oligarchy. When in an emergency the republic should entrust its head with autocratic power, the law should provide for its termination. It is no mere coincidence that our Constitution embodied most of these principles, especially the last. For some of the fathers of our Constitution were quite familiar with the classics, including Machiavelli.

**HONEST PUBLIC SERVANT**

From the vast literature on Machiavelli there emerges a man who was passionately devoted to his city-state of Florence and who in those times might have feathered his nest, but chose instead to be an incorruptible public servant. This is notable because of the worthless Florentine regime that he served. His ultimate dream was the unification of Italy, realized many generations later by Mazzini and Cavour.

"The Prince," too, despite its shocking realism, has overtones of advice for us all. Most of us are unwilling to face the realities of politics. Some cynically accept its darker ways and profit therefrom. Others denounce it and propose impotent and impractical reforms. Others turn their faces away, like the man who decided to ignore the French Revolution. A choice few recognize that politics is human nature and seek the best government that can be attained, despite the inherent weakness of all men. Such a one was Niccolò Machiavelli. Surely, in the light of these prophecies and precepts Machiavelli deserves better than has been accorded his memory in the years since his death in 1527.
