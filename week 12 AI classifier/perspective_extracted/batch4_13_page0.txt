**Choices in Washington**

by Raymond Moley

THE current conflict between President Eisenhower and the "liberals" in Congress seems to be turning in favor of the former. This is good for those who have savings, pay taxes, and believe in freedom in economic affairs.

The issue is between an economy planned from the top, and decisions by millions of Americans seeking their own welfare and security, their own ways of spending their money or investing it and thus providing for the economy of the nation a massive flow of goods, money, and production.

If we add together the many "liberal" proposals for planning and financing urban growth, agriculture, education, medical care, and prices, we have the pattern of a planned society, a socialist's dream.

The concept of a planned economy, widely taught by academic theoreticians and now the credo of the leftist wing of the Congress, is based upon two absurdly naive conditions. To make planning effective would require two factorsâ€”an omniscient government and a completely obedient and cooperative citizenry. Neither has ever existed on this planet. When British socialists and American liberals prate of a planned economy in a democratic state, they are conjuring up a dream world, a society of deities.

When the idea was accepted from 1945 to 1951, in Britain, it was found that while democratic institutions were preserved, the planners made a mess of governing. In Red Russia, Nazi Germany, and Fascist Italy all-wise planners were unnecessary because omnipotent government was assured by a ruthless police state.

**OLD IDEA, NEW NAMES**

This issue is not new. If we pick up the thread of history in the eighteenth century, we find George III, perhaps emulating Louis XIV of France, attempting to dominate the economy from the top. The result was widespread flaunting of the law in England, "a piece of land entirely surrounded by smugglers." Colonists in America utterly wrecked the royal blueprints. "An Englishman," warned Edmund Burke at the time, "is the unfittest person on earth to argue another Englishman into slavery."

In the same year, 1776, when Jefferson wrote the manifesto of political liberty, Adam Smith published his imperishable argument for economic freedom, "The Wealth of Nations." These two complementary expressions of freedom of choice dominated the English-speaking world for generations.

John Chamberlain in a recent, fascinating book, "The Roots of Capitalism," begins with these two expressions of liberty and carries the account to the present day. The history is "a seamless web." There is nothing new but the names and actors.

As a student at Columbia in 1914, I heard on all sides that Adam Smith was old hat, reactionary, unsuited to the modern world. An adaptation of Marx was fashionable under the name of "economic determinism." Later, in the 1930s, John Maynard Keynes mounted the throne with a glittering gear of theories and formulas.

**POLITICS AND KEYNES**

Supplementing and greatly extending the Chamberlain case against Keynes is another new book, "The Failure of the 'New Economics'-An Analysis of the Keynesian Fallacies," by my NEWSWEEK colleague, Henry Hazlitt. In this, Keynes, the Mohammed of academicians, is met on his own ground and, piece by piece, his bags of tricks are turned inside out and the rubbish therein scattered for all to see and understand.

Both Chamberlain and Hazlitt make clear the basic failure in the "new" economics. Two elements are lacking in economics as now taught under the inspiration of Keynes and Marx which were present in John Locke a century before Smith and down through the classical true liberals to Henry George and Herbert Spencer a century after Smith. These elements are moral philosophy and political science. The very abandonment of the old name "political economy" signalizes this fact. To illustrate, Keynes favored spending for its own sake in the depression decade. But his ignorance of politics failed to teach him that once spending was exalted as government policy, politics would carry on in better times. The sorcerer failed to reckon on his apprentices. They could open the spigot but never could close it.
