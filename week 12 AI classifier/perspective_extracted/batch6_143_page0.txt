Security, Scarcity, Austerity
by Raymond Moley

It is an interesting coincidence that
the automobile industry is this
month dramatizing for us the two distinct
choices that lie before us in economic
life. On the one hand, the
management of the companies is risking
hundreds of millions in a competitive
contest for a larger market and a
progressively rising standard of living.
On the other hand, the United Automobile
Workers, led by
Walter Reuther, are seeking
to impose upon the industry
a species of socialistic
uniformity in the shape of
a guaranteed annual wage.
The issue thus presented
deserves the attention of
all Americans, for it defines
the essential difference between
a spurious security
and the zest of growth.

The automobile industry is placing
before the American people a line
of new models. To produce these,
Chrysler alone is risking $250 million;
General Motors, $600 million, and
Ford, $150 million. In its relation to
its share of the market, the Chrysler
presentation is more costly and more
sweeping than the two others mentioned.
Its management believes the
greater the pinch of competition, the
greater the risk should be.
There is no guarantee that these
many millions will come back with a
profit. The recovery of such an investment
depends upon the energy
and skill with which the products are
promoted. But that energy and skill,
powered by a hope of greater returns,
are the dynamic forces in a free economy.
They are what have made for us
the America in which we live.

The automobile business depends
in a very special way upon a rapid
turnover of cars in the hands of the
public. The intent of the companies
is to make car owners unhappy with
what they have by tempting them
with something more attractive. As we
all know, a modern automobile with
care will last a long time. But the man
who owns it must be induced to turn
it in long before it is worn out and to
get something better. Used cars pass
through the hands of many owners.
All this produces hundreds of thousands
of jobs and induces billions of
investment in the producing companies.
It also keeps 400,000 men and
women employed by hundreds of suppliers
of parts. If everyone decided to
drive his car as long as it would run,
the industry would shrink, hundreds
of thousands of jobs would vanish, and
the American standard of living would
be materially lowered.

The socialist calls this a wasteful
and irrational system. He would wear
everything out and eliminate most
sales effort as economic
waste. We would be supposed
to remain happy with
what we have. Risk, they
say, would vanish. Our
loads of leisure would be
filled with noncompetitive
weaving, folk dancing, and
artsy-craftsy drama furnished
by a noncompetitive
state. There would be lots
of mediocre education, in
which everyone would get "A," and
sports in which everybody would win.
What a life!

Reuther is ideologically an authentic
socialist. The guaranteed annual
wage which he seeks is in the pattern
of his philosophy. If applied to the automobile
industry there would have to
be revolutionary changes. The companies,
in order to guarantee an
annual wage, would have to reduce
their output to meet a guaranteed
market. A guaranteed market would
be one in which only enough cars
would be produced to replace those
which go to the scrap yard. Only a
fraction of the people now employed
would be kept. There would be very
few new models. Hundreds of suppliers
would go out of business. Production
would fall to perhaps a third. The
present investment in the business
could not be supported on such a low
production volume, and the number
of companies would drop to two or
even one large manufacturer. Competition
would sag, and management
would decline in spirit and initiative.
Reuther would anticipate all this by a
demand for greater and greater government
expenditures to meet the
resulting unemployment.

In the stagnant destitute civilization
that Reuther would anticipate,
even security would prove to be an
illusion. For the certain end of guaranteed
security is scarcity, and the
end of scarcity is austerity.
