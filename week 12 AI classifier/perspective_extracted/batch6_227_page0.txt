**Domesticating Big Mo**

**by Raymond Moley**

A LITTLE less than a year ago, the
Missouri River was front-page
news. That sprawling, unpredictable,
and unmannerly giant threw its
weight about, and the frail creations
of mere human beings were scattered
or obliterated. Homes, farms, facto-
ries, highways, and railroads were
overwhelmed. I recall that in May,
driving an automobile eastward from
Nebraska, I traveled seemingly
endless miles of detour past farms
over which were strewn the flotsam of
hundreds of upstream miles.
In September, driving over
the same course, I found
the detours, the ruin, and
the rubbish still there. The
long summer had come and
gone, and the damage was
still unrepaired.

In April, when this wet terror was
at its height, President Truman, newly
divested of ambition to run again,
made a sensational flight over the
Missouri Valley. Like most travelers,
he returned with the knowledge he
left home with. He called for a Federal
program for the valley. He blamed
Congress for not building "two big
dams which would have helped to
prevent the flood."

Then, after that pronouncement, the
President turned to the frying of other
fish; the public fixed its eyes on four
and twenty people who wanted to be
President; the Missouri sullenly returned
to its course; the public in general
forgot all about floods; the unfortunate
victims laboriously tried to clear their
land and rebuild their homes and barns
and factories; and the debate about who
should plan river improvements went on.
A bipartisan Missouri Basin Commission
had been appointed by the President in
January 1952. A year later this body
submitted a report which revealed once
more the old conflict in viewpoints.
And there the matter stands. We shall
not have a flood like that of a year ago
because the snowfall was light this winter.
But in the backstreams, heavy rains will
have effect.

A major issue involved is whether
there shall be big dams in the main
stream of the river, the main purpose
of which will be electric-power development,
or many small dams and other
improvements up in the regions where
the river sources lie. The latter would
involve extensive soil-conservation
programs, and leadership in it would lie
in the Federal Department of Agriculture.

In response to some proposals laid
before it by Raymond McConnell Jr.,
editor of the Lincoln, Neb., State
Journal, the National Association of
Soil Conservation Districts recently
urged that there be a redirection of
Federal policy in the field of natural-
resources conservation, with a new
emphasis on related land treatment and
upstream flood and erosion prevention.

Striking away from the hackneyed
big-dam vs. little-dam controversy, it
urged that upstream measures and land
treatment "should precede or be concurrent
with downstream development," but that the
planning of Federal, state, and local
water-use and control programs should
begin with proper land treatment and
stabilization of small tributaries, with
last priority assigned to major downstream
control works.

The NASCD proposed further that
"primary consideration should be given
to the willingness of state and local
agencies to share in the cost of improvements
and provide for their maintenance."

The farmers back of the NASCD are
taxpayers, too, some of them heavy
taxpayers. They made it clear that they
are not asking for more Federal spending.
What they insist on, however, is that of
whatever Federal funds are appropriated
for land and water resources development
and control, upstream land and watershed
programs should have a more "realistic"
share.

THAT this "grass-roots" policy is
likely to find acceptance as national
policy is suggested by the interest it is
evoking nationwide and in Congress, by
its complete consistency with President
Eisenhower's known views and philosophy,
and by the fact that it is in this area that
lies one of the few opportunities for the
Republican Administration to make a record
of positive improvements altogether its own.
