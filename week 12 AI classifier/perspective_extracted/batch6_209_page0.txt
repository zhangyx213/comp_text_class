The Senator Misconstrues
by Raymond Moley

SEN. ALEXANDER WILEY, in the
course of his crusade against a
proposed constitutional amendment
introduced with the approval of 60-
odd senators which would protect the
Constitution against amendment by
treaty, has paid me a rare compli-
ment. He has hurled nine columns of
fine print in the Congressional Rec-
ord at two or three sentences in my
article in NEWSWEEK of July
6. My space precludes the
exchange of word-for-word
verbal broadsides, but I
will invite another torrent
by a short rejoinder.

I am happy to offer such
an invitation because the
senator has thrown up a
nugget with which I can
smite him very effectively.
His argument turns upon
these sentences of mine which refer
to the famous case of Missouri vs.
Holland:

"Thus, a treaty ordinarily under-
stood to deal only with international
affairs moves squarely into the field
of domestic legislation and, in fact,
supersedes the Constitution of the
United States. The protection of an
international duck takes precedence
over the constitutional protections of
American citizens."

The senator quotes a statement
from the late Professor Borchard who
was librarian of the Supreme Court
during the period before the Missouri
vs. Holland case. I gladly accept
Borchard as an authority. He was the
most brilliant student of the great John
Bassett Moore and during his long ca-
reer was a foremost student of inter-
national and constitutional law.

Borchard says, in the senator's quo-
tation, that after doubt had been
thrown upon the constitutionality of an
act of Congress which sought to ex-
tend Federal sovereignty over migra-
tory birds in American states Chief
Justice White asked him to make a
thorough study of the question.
Borchard reported that only the states
possessed such jurisdiction within
their territorial limits.

Then, says Borchard, the Chief
Justice, Justice Holmes, the Bureau of
Animal Husbandry, and a senator put
their heads together and devised a
scheme to open a gap in the Constitu-
tion. The plan was to get the Presi-
dent and Senate to conclude a treaty
with Canada and then to get a law
passed to give the Federal govern-
ment power that it did not possess
before. The treaty was negotiated
and approved, Congress passed the
legislation, the Department of Agri-
culture turned its game wardens loose,
Missouri resisted the invasion, the case
went to the Supreme Court, and Jus-
tice Holmes provided a
decision for the Federal
government in Missouri vs.
Holland. If this was not co-
operation-I use no stronger
word-among the Court, the
Executive, and the Senate to
breach the Constitution, I am
at a loss for words.

This, to say the least, is a
dubious, dangerous method
of amending the Constitu-
tion, chiefly because it does so by
action of only two of the agencies of
government, the Executive and the
Senate. It cuts off from the process
of revision the House of Representa-
tives and the states. It is exactly what
is designed to be prevented by the
proposed amendment so carefully
drawn by distinguished lawyers of the
American Bar Association. This pro-
posed amendment has in another
place been described by Senator
Wiley as a "godsend to Malenkov and
company." Indeed, Malenkov will ulti-
mately need a better godsend than
that and a more rational opponent
than Senator Wiley.

JUSTICE HOLMES in Missouri vs. Hol-
land reveals the entire plan in
which he participated by saying that
in "matters of the sharpest exigency"
which "an act of Congress could not
deal with," a treaty "followed by such
an act could." What are "matters of
sharpest exigency"? In Missouri vs.
Holland the "matters" were ducks. In
the Declaration of Human Rights pro-
posed as a treaty by Mrs. Roosevelt
and her colleagues in the UNESCO
there are all sorts of "matters" which if
adopted by the President and Senate
would supersede the Bill of Rights.
The present Chief Justice has said in
the steel-seizure case that the Presi-
dent under the U.N. Charter has pow-
ers forbidden him in the Constitution.
I suggest that Senator Wiley use
another nine columns to reply to this.
