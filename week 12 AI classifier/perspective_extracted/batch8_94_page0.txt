**The Habit of Freedom**

What is advertising in this econ-
omy of ours? Is it a vital organ—a heart
or a liver or a brain? Or is it something we
could go on without, if we had to—an
eye, a leg, a tongue? One way to answer
questions like that in the world of medicine
is to experiment. The surgeon takes a
white rat, lops off this or that and sees if
the animal dies. That can’t be done in our
economy. At least it can’t be done except
at the risk of a terrific upheaval. But some
businesses once offered themselves up as
economic white rats. And from their ex-
perience we may learn something.

During the last war, these businesses—
seventeen of them—decided to discontinue
advertising for the duration. What hap-
pened to them—the clinical result of the
experiment—has recently been described
by Mr. Walter H. Gebhart. Of the seven-
teen major companies which discontinued
or greatly reduced advertising in the last
war, he found that six sold out or were ab-
sorbed by competitors. One failed and
went out of business. One went into re-
ceivership. One was deflated 97 per cent
in terms of personnel. One lost 81 per cent
of its sales volume. One ended with only
two customers. Three lost their leadership
in their fields. One was operated by the
banks for five years. Two found that com-
petitors had grown at their expense.

Thus the experimenters. Their bleak
story is now so well known throughout the
business world that it is unlikely to be re-
inforced by any more volunteers. The next
white rats aren’t going to jump up on the
dissecting table.

So far as we can tell, then, indi-
vidual businesses are hurt, sometimes fa-
tally, by the cessation of advertising. But
what’s that to the public? The answer is
“plenty.” If you doubt it, look back at the
early ’30s and consider what the firms that
went under pulled down along with them.
Your bank, sometimes. The job of a rela-
tive whose support you suddenly had to
assume. The interest rate on your savings.
Your own job, perhaps. Your own busi-
ness, if it was one of those that had sup-
plied materials to unfortunate firms.

Or, if you prefer, look at it another way—
this question of the interdependence of
economic life. Examine the role that big
companies play in the economic system
that supports us. It is a truism that big
companies are big advertisers. That, inci-
dentally, is one of the reasons why they
are big. Big companies must inevitably


If our system of private enterprise can-
not find the means to employ these new
facilities, chaos will rise over us all. For
these productive capacities can be liabili-
ties as well as assets. Merely to enumerate
them suggests, to the pessimist, the wife
whose husband telegraphed her the news
that he was broke. “Never mind,” she re-
plied. “You still have me and the children.”

There is plenty that the pessimist can
mirror darkly in the postwar world. We
shall have a staggering public debt, a stag-
gering tax burden. We shall have a bu-
reaucracy unparalleled in this country,
sticking to the public payroll as a dog to a
bone. We shall have unemployment—tem-
porary or not, as we choose to make it—
and sharpened poverty. Living standards
will be down. Experience assures us that
we shall have a kind of national hangover,
a spiritual slump. And the temptation for
some of us will be strong to scrap the
works and try something or anything else

But before we yield the floor to the
pessimist, before we assume a crackup fol-
lowed by some sort of Communist civiliza-
tion, let’s look at another postwar certain-
ty. There will be 130,000,000 of us—
130,000,000 people reared in the habit of
economic freedom. Call it what you will—
individualism, private enterprise—it means
that Americans want to go where they
please, work where they please, say and do
as they please and take the risks that go
with freedom. Two or three or five years
are a poor match for hundreds of years in
human history. Habit is stronger in all of
us than any other attribute—reason in-
cluded. You can write it in the book that
despite “new days” and “new deals” the
habit of economic freedom will still endure
in the American people after this war—
the habit of wanting to go and speak and
work as they please. And as long as it does,
private enterprise will endure. As long as
it does, we shall have a secure base on
which our economic life can move—a
system capable of keeping our vast new
plant operating, our people employed, our
standards of living rising.

Modern advertising is built around hu-
man habit. A child of experience, it has
learned in a hard school. Its defects—and
no reasonable person claims perfection for
it—are, in large part, self-correcting. Un-
fair and untruthful and excessive advertising
visits its penalty exactly where it be-
longs. But, over the years, advertising has
built upon the deepest certitude in human
nature—the certitude that as men emerge
into the light of civilization, their demands
and needs increase. Advertising helps to
define these needs and to translate them
into vital markets. In these needs is the
promise that our national consumption will
run even with our capacity to produce.
And in that balance lies our security. Our
very needs can save us all from want. That
truth, paradoxical as it seems, is the key
to what we are and have.

play a major part in postwar readjust-
ment. They will play that part not only
because of the hundreds of thousands of
men and women they employ, the millions
in wages and taxes they pay and the goods
they produce, but because what happens
to them will affect the stability of count-
less smaller firms that supply them with
materials, parts and services.

Among those firms are distributors.
Take them as an example. They are small
business. Their plight, in many cases, is
now serious. They have less to sell than
they did. They are laying off men. Their
profits are diminishing. Their only hope
of survival lies in a continued postwar de-
mand for the goods they have been selling.
And more specifically still, it lies in the
extent to which people will continue to
think of the products they sell—think of
them by name. Just as their well-being is
meshed with that of the great producers,
so is the well-being of thousands of other
small firms. Obviously, the vast familica-
tions of the big companies make their
preservation a matter of critical public
interest. Their power of consumption and
employment is a backlog essential to us all.

But we cannot afford to bank only
on that. To satisfy deferred demands in
the postwar world will help us restore the
normal currents of economic life: it will
not accomplish what is indispensable if we
are to avoid an appalling depression. On
one fact there is no disagreement: our
postwar economy will have to move at a
still more rapid tempo.

We shall emerge from this period with a
vastly expanded plant. Already, since we
started to rearm, 784 new plants have been
built with two billion dollars of govern-
ment money. Many others have been built
privately. We are improving our land and
air transportation systems. What is to be-
come of this plant after the war? Shall the
new factories be left to rust? Shall the
ships be left to rot away, as we left them
once before? Shall the tens of thousands of
skilled workers whom we have trained in
the past two years be thrown on relief?
And what is to become of the new prod-
ucts and processes that are getting them-
selves born in plants laden with defense
orders? Inventive brains are working and
laboratories are buzzing these days. There
is a boom in the patent office. Priorities
are harsh but useful teachers. Manufac-
turers are trying to find alternative mate-
rials for their products—“alternates,” as
Mr. W. J. Cameron properly warns us to
call them, and not “substitutes.” Are
these, too, to be thrown into the discard?
