**PERSPECTIVE**

**Presidential Government**

**by Raymond Moley**

It is an unfortunate habit of Americans never to consider seriously the nature of their institutions except in or immediately after a crisis. The Kennedy tragedy has been such a crisis and calls for a consideration and appraisal of the Presidency.

Thoughtful people and the press have turned their attention to the personality of the new President. What is he like? What will be his policies and methods? What will be the personnel of his Administration? These questions arise because we have assumed, quite correctly, that this is a personal government and the Presidency will be whatever any specific incumbent of the office chooses to make it. That has been inevitable ever since the men who wrote the Constitution in 1787 finished their work. Jefferson in faraway France, after receiving a copy of the document, wrote with great apprehension to John Adams and Madison. He believed that there was danger in the great power given to the President. He believed that any President might, if he chose, perpetuate himself in office. The Presidential institution has stood, however, as it was created, with the restriction only of the two-term amendment. The men who wrote the Constitution were looking at their presiding officer, George Washington, and felt that he could be trusted with vast powers.

**THE HISTORY**

The fact that the Presidency introduces, even compels, a measure of personal government has been most vividly shown whenever on the seven occasions before this one a Vice President has succeeded to the office after the death of a President.

John Tyler when he succeeded to the Presidency found himself almost immediately in a struggle with the Whigs, on whose ticket he had been elected with Harrison. His entire Cabinet, except for State Secretary Webster, resigned in protest. Fillmore, who succeeded Taylor, broke with his former New York friends and supporters. Andrew Johnson clashed with a radical Republican Congress. Lincoln could have weathered the storm. Chester Arthur broke with the spoils system. His independent appointments shocked the New York leaders who had supported him for a place on the Garfield ticket. TR had been nominated by bosses Platt and Quay to get him out of New York. His Administration and policies differed vastly from McKinley’s. In the cases of Coolidge and Truman the change was not so marked. But there were changes in direction, methods, emphasis, and personnel.

**JOHNSON IS DIFFERENT**

In most of these instances the change was the more marked because of the political superstition that a ticket must be “balanced.” In two of the first three cases the combination was Whig and then a Republican teamed with a Democrat. In the next three it was a Midwestern Republican with an Eastern Republican. In the case of Truman it had been the stark appraisal of the astute Edward J. Flynn that the choice would do the least harm to the ticket. Only in the Kennedy-Johnson combination was the Vice Presidential candidate a material asset.

And so in the present instance we shall see, if history and the nature of our institutions prove anything, a different sort of Presidency. There will be, of course, the usual assurance of continuity of policies and even in most cases personnel. But change will be inevitable. No two Presidents ever differed so markedly in personal qualities, background, methods, and personal friendships as Messrs. Kennedy and Johnson. One shrewd observer has said that the Kennedy strength was in proposing, Mr. Johnson’s is in disposing.

The Johnson imagination is not remarkable, but his capacity to get results has been proven. Congress will have more confidence in the new President. Relations will be better. For those who interpret the change in terms of economics it should be said that Mr. Johnson understands the psychology and problems of business better than did his predecessor. As to specific policies and personnel, this is too early to make predictions. But there will be a marked change. That is inevitable in our system of government. To repeat, the Presidency is what a President makes of it.
