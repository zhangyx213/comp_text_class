**PERSPECTIVE**

**Industrial Minute Men**

**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

Toledo, Ohio—While Congressmen
and social reformers sat wailing at the
bedside of small business, a few much
maligned industrial leaders in this city
have really done something about it.
A year or so ago, the outlook for To-
ledo's industry was excellent. Its infinite
variety of plants had a ten-year-high
backlog of orders covering chiefly civilian
needs. Then came the icy winds of pri-
orities and allocations. Chills and fever
set in—particularly violent among small,
specialized companies.

Resistance of Toledo's economy was
low because, while a large proportion
of its industry was built around the
fabrication of metals, it was primarily
devoted to light-metal manufacturing
and hence not too easily convertible to
war production. But there was nothing
light or brittle about Toledo's industrial
leaders. One of them, Charles E. Swartz-
baugh, president of the Chamber of
Commerce, turned the organization of
which he was head to the job of mobiliz-
ing the city's resources—big business
and little—to cope with the problem.
That he has succeeded, through the
Toledo Defense Production Association
he organized within the Chamber of
Commerce, is attested by the extra-
ordinary war-production and employ-
ment record of the city at the present
time. Even more important, this success
provides a lesson the nation as a whole
would do well to ponder.

Step No. 1 was a thorough survey
of all machine facilities in the area, the
products made, processes utilized and
the type and quantity of labor avail-
able. Then came the organization of
machinery to make it easier for every
company to quote on government pro-
curements. This organization—the To-
ledo Defense Production Association,
on whose board of ten, incidentally,
three local labor leaders sit—secured a
clearance from the Department of
Justice to avoid citation for violation
of the antitrust laws.

Next, it brought procurement officials
from Washington to explain to Toledo's
manufacturing companies the policies
of their respective services, established
working relations with the appropriate
procurement offices and secured several
schedules which, with specifications and
blueprints, it exhibited at a meeting
called for the purpose. Companies in-
terested in taking the prime contract
were invited to register themselves and
—here is the significant fact—all other
companies interested in handling sub-
contracting work on parts or com-
ponents of the war product in question
likewise registered.

From these beginnings has grown a
system under which, once the prime
contractor negotiates his contract, the
job is divided up among many smaller
companies which are helped, when
necessary, by the loan of engineers, ac-
countants and managers by larger com-
panies. In one case a vacuum-cleaner
company is the prime contractor and
more than 60 per cent of the complex
war product it is turning out is being
made in the facilities of smaller com-
panies in the Toledo area which were
lined up by the association.

In this way, the association has been
responsible for bringing millions of dol-
lars' worth of contracts into plants which
otherwise would not have had the work.
It has not only helped keep compa-
nies alive and helped them do their
part in the war effort but has been
an important factor in achieving an
industrial employment now higher than
it has been at any time since September
1929.

Its work is based on the following
simple propositions: (1) that the small
manufacturer cannot, without great ex-
pense and exhausting leg work, find
something in Washington his company
can do; (2) that most available con-
tracts will not fit his capacities; (3) that
a single contract, intelligently split up,
can provide work for a whole flock of
companies in a single well-knit region;
(4) that the splitting up can best be
done in the region through cooperation
of big and little companies there; and
(5) that little fellows do not usually
have the necessary engineering, account-
ing and managerial staffs to master the
available jobs.

Similar in many respects to the
York, Pa., plan tried out some time ago,
the Toledo plan reinforces Washington's
belated recognition that geographical
decentralization is essential not only to
expeditious production but to the sur-
vival of small manufacturing businesses.
For Toledo has amply proved that, with
reasonable freedom from Washington,
management can do miracles.
