**STRICTER LICENSING**

Teaching in the high schools has had good results. Drivometer tests
show that the students who have had
hours operating the Simulators have
markedly better behavior in traffic.
But it must be remembered that only
a relatively few high-school students
have had this education, and great
numbers of drivers did not go to high
school.

Teen-agers can't be kept off the
road. Parents and legislators believe
that the use of an automobile is es-
sential to get to school or to a place
of employment. The necessity is for
more compulsory training in many
more schools.

It hardly needs to be said that al-
cohol is the deadly enemy of skills
and judgment. It is a factor in 50 per
cent of fatal accidents. More restric-
tions, more knowledge and more pen-
alties are necessary.

In most states, drivers' tests are lax
or routine or both. In too many states
licenses are renewed without periodi-
cal tests. One totally blind woman
had her license renewed more than
once. It pleased her to have the sta-
tus of a driver, even though she never
drove a car.

State legislation everywhere should
be stiffened to require more than a
simple lot of questions and a run
down the street and around the cor-
ner. Tests should be provided in all
states covering the whole personality
of the applicant.
