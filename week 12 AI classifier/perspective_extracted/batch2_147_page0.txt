**PERSPECTIVE**

**Expendable Missiles**

*by Raymond Moley*

A REVIEW of Cuban developments
suggests two vital conclusions. One
is that Khrushchev considered the
missiles and bombers which we belatedly discovered as expendable
items in his over-all plans. The other
is that the negotiations so far have
weakened rather than strengthened
our security and that of our southern neighbors. Perhaps these conclusions will be disproved by future
developments. Certainly they will be
disputed by our policy-makers.

Before the missiles and bombers
were detected, and later, when we
were assured that they were purely
"defensive," an immense procession
of ships brought military and technical material and other supplies and
men to Cuba. With provision for
supporting Cuba's people and industries and for putting muscle into Castro's military and police forces, the
possibility of internal revolt vanished. And Cuba was made very
much safer from invasion. Thus the
Kremlin acquired a launching pad
for subversion and other purposes.

As Adm. Alfred Thayer Mahan
said long ago: "The Caribbean is the
strategic key to the two great
oceans," and Cuba was the key to the
Caribbean. This is discussed by Arthur M. Wilcox in the December issue
of the Proceedings of the United
States Naval Institute. The Navy and
the plodding merchantmen must still
carry on their responsibilities along
our trade routes.

**WHAT REMAINS IN CUBA**

Even after the missiles have been
removed-and we cannot be sure that
they are all gone-and the bombers
have been taken out, the Soviet still
has accommodations for trawlers and
submarines. Petroleum, parts, torpedoes may be planted and secreted
near many small harbors.

Probably there is powerful electronic equipment out of our reach in
Cuba and on trawlers. Thus broadcasting, monitoring, jamming, espionage, and subversion can go on. Also
—and this is most vital—there is the
possibility for Cuban installations
greatly to strengthen the capacity of
the Communists to obtain information
concerning space and missile activities at Canaveral.

Many people, including this writer,
urged restrictions on shipping in and
out of Cuba. On Oct. 4 Secretary
Rusk announced that the President
would impose such restrictions. Six
weeks later Senator Proxmire wrote
to the Secretary, asking why such restrictions had not been imposed. On
Dec. 6 Assistant Secretary Dutton replied that the restrictions were "still
under consideration."

**NO ON-SITE INSPECTION**

The alacrity with which Khrushchev agreed to remove the missiles
and bombers clearly indicated that
he did not regard these weapons as
essential to his plans. If they were,
he would have followed his habit of
stalling. They were apparently pawns
in Khrushchev's gambit. This follows
the Communist policy of two steps
forward and one back.

We lost our demand for on-site
inspection immediately after our actions on Oct. 24. For instead of demanding that Khrushchev force his
puppet Castro to comply, we decided
to delegate that responsibility to
U Thant. In a superb piece of journalistic enterprise, Henry J. Taylor discovered that in Castro's four-hour
tirade to the Cuban people after his
conference with U Thant, he included a transcript of their talk which
U Thant's office later verified.

This text shows that U Thant told
the U.S. Government before he
went to Cuba that his mission was to
say that "as soon as the dismantling
of the missile system is verified...
the United States would guarantee
the territorial integrity of Cuba...
and suspend the blockade."...
He told Castro that his mission was
not "to arrange the details for the
presence of the United Nations in
Cuba." This would be "trampling on
the sovereignty of Cuba." Thus, we
lost our demand for on-site inspection
because we entrusted the responsibility to the U.N., which had no
power to insist upon it.

And so the Soviet has a firm grip
on its fortress Cuba. We have lifted
the blockade. And our guarantee to
respect the territorial integrity of
Cuba can only be escaped by invoking the ambiguous word "verified"
in U Thant's statement to Castro.
