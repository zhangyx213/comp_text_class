**PERSPECTIVE**

**Parties and Principles II**

**by Raymond Moley**

LAST week I summarized the results of a most important analysis, by a highly reliable private research agency, of the voting of members of Congress on an ideological scale running from what is currently called conservative to liberal. It is based upon the votes on vital issues in the 1961 session of the 87th Congress. Not only in the choice of issues counted, but in its comprehensiveness this study is much more revealing than those of the AFL-CIO's COPE, the ADA, and the ACA, which considered only from ten to eighteen issues. This one is based upon 115 roll calls in the Senate and 40 in the House.

It shows that in the more conservative group there are 32 senators—24 Republicans, and eight Democrats. In the middle group are nine Republicans and seven Democrats. In the more liberal group are two Republicans—Case of New Jersey and Javits—along with 48 Democrats.

In the House, in the more conservative group there are 155 Republicans and 21 Democrats. In the middle group, there are thirteen Republicans and eighteen Democrats. In the more liberal group there are four Republicans and 217 Democrats.

In this article I shall explain the statistical method used in the study and also name the most conservative and most liberal individual members.

**THE METHOD**

The roll calls selected were mostly votes cast on amendments to vital bills. This was done because the real sentiments of members are most often registered then, rather than on the final passage of bills. This because after amendments have been adopted or defeated, members are likely to decide to take "half a loaf."

The issues selected involved the enlargement of the powers of the Federal government, fiscal responsibility and spending, and the intervention of government in labor-management relations and the free competitive economy. Except where foreign relations had a direct bearing on the foregoing, such votes were omitted. Also omitted were votes on civil rights and procedural matters.

In calculating the record of members, yea and nay votes and also absences were considered. However, this method, which really counted against the member his failure to vote, seemed to me to be inadequate in comparing the records of members because absences were in large part due to personal or family illness or important party or legislative business out of Washington. For example, those of Senators Morton and Goldwater and Congressman Miller were because of their party duties.

**THE TOP NAMES**

Therefore, in the Senate listing I have recalculated the record only according to yea and nay votes. Thus corrected and in alphabetical order, the fifteen most conservative senators were Allott, Bennett, Butler, Capehart, Case of South Dakota, Cotton, Curtis, Dirksen, Dworshak, Goldwater, Hickenlooper, Hruska, Miller, Mundt, and Williams of Delaware—all Republicans.

The most liberal were, in alphabetical order: Clark, Hart, Humphrey, Jackson, Long of Missouri, McCarthy, McGee, McNamara, Mansfield, Metcalf, Morse, Muskie, Neuberger, Randolph, and Smith of Massachusetts—all Democrats.

Since the order would not be measurably changed in the listing, I have taken the original ranking in the study for the twenty most conservative and twenty most liberal members of the House. The most conservative were, in alphabetical order: Ashbrook, Becker, Beermann, Bolton, Bruce, Church, Clancy, Devine, Hoffman of Illinois, Jonas, King of New York, McCulloch, Meader, Ostertag, Pillion, Poff, Ray, Robison, Schadeberg, and Taber—all Republicans.

The most liberal were, alphabetically: Anfuso, Buckley, Celler, Friedel, Healey, Johnson of California, Karsten, Kastenmeier, Keogh, King of Utah, McCormack, McDowell, Multer, O’Hara of Michigan, Powell, Rabaut, Santangelo, Smith of Iowa, Ullman, and Wickersham—all Democrats.

After the 1960 election it was widely commented that the newly elected members of the House were more conservative than their predecessors. This study bears this out in the case of 75 per cent of the individuals involved.
