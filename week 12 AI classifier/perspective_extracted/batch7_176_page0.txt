**Perspective**

**Blood, Ballots and Boodle**

by RAYMOND MOLEY

IN the course of a hot week in the
summer of 1925, I was engaged in
the most gruesome task of my life. It
was in Kansas City, and I was examining
the coroner's records of Jackson
County. This research was part of an
investigation of crime and criminal law
enforcement in Missouri. As I read the
accounts of violent deaths, an underlying
condition of law enforcement appeared
to me. Many deaths
were due to shootings by the
police. It is a general principle of
police work that good
police are not killers. The
rate of deaths in enforcing
the law varies inversely with
police efficiency. And where
there are inefficient police
there is usually incompetent
and corrupt government.
Kansas City was badly
governed, and the worst was yet to
come, for in that year 1925 Tom Pendergast
consolidated the machine that
was destined to rule for thirteen years.
The man who smashed that sinister
sovereignty was Maurice M. Milligan,
United States District Attorney for
the Western District of Missouri from
1934 until, undoubtedly because of the
opposition of Vice President Harry S.
Truman, he lost his job in 1945.
This was a strange reward for a man
who had done as outstanding a job of
machine smashing as we have had in
American political annals.

BUT Milligan now has his day in the
court of public opinion with a gripping
book, "Missouri Waltz."* This
account of Milligan's service as District
Attorney is a terrific political story. It
has style, suspense and punch. And it
will not help the President in his bid
for reelection.
Milligan skillfully portrays three aspects
of the Pendergast grip on his city:
First, the connection between the machine
and the underworld. Second, the ruthless
practice of stealing votes. Third,
stupendous milking of private business
for the personal profit of the boss.
In 1933, the year before Milligan was
appointed, the country was shocked by
the Union Station Massacre. Before this
crime was finally solved and sealed, new
light was thrown on corrupt politics.
The bloody trail led from gangdom to
the machine through the inevitable
fixers, such as Johnny Lazia who, according
to Milligan, had placed 60 ex-convicts on
the police payroll. This
demonstration of lawlessness provided
the public indignation which sustained
Milligan in his next step, which was
against the despoilers of the ballot.
The election of 1936 was the raw
material for an attack on corrupt elections.
Milligan, backed by
Federal Judge, Albert L.
Reeves, now moved directly
against machine politics.
After two years, scores of
election officials and machine
henchmen were convicted of
flagrant vote stealing.
Finally, the trail led to
Pendergast himself—rich,
gaudy, arrogant and slowly
yielding to the opiate of
power. Perhaps he never would have
been exposed, except for a fatal weakness.
The aging boss, to whom money
from many sources flowed so easily, was
a sucker for horse races. He lost continually
and in massive amounts. This,
no doubt, led him to accept a piece of
bribery that would have shamed Boss
Tweed. Hundreds of thousands of dollars
were traced directly to him, and the
law closed down. He and accomplices
went to Leavenworth. Shortly after his
release, death closed his grimy book of
life.
The greatly impaired machine came
back under a Pendergast nephew, Jim.
There was sufficient life to defeat Congressman
Slaughter in 1946, but that
victory has now been exposed as a steal.
Last week, the machine was again
beaten in a city election.

IN the account of his crusade, Milligan
is careful to note that he had invaluable
help from President Roosevelt, the
Justice and Treasury Departments—
notably the FBI—and the indefatigable
Kansas City Star.
After the indictment of Pendergast,
Roosevelt said to Milligan: "I told
Harry Truman the other day that he
had better get away from that crowd
out there." That was one Roosevelt
dictum that Truman neglected. For in
December 1945 he wrote to the younger
Pendergast: "I hope the outfit is still
going good."
Well, the outfit is not going good—
and neither is Harry S. Truman.
