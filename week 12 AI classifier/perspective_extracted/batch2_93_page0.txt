**The Decline of the East**

by Raymond Moley

THE great influence of economic
interests in political conflicts is
well illustrated in the perennial divi-
sion in the Republican Party between
what I call the East and the West.
By the East I mean the section
bounded by the Appalachian Moun-
tains, the Mason and Dixon line, and
the Atlantic Ocean. By the West I
mean the remainder of the nation
except the eleven Southern states.
The intraparty struggle began in
1860 when the supporters of Lincoln
wrested the nomination from William
H. Seward. After that, the conflict
was mostly resolved by giving the
Vice Presidential nomination to the
side that lost the contest for the
first place on the ticket. Thus we
had Hayes-Wheeler, Garfield-Arthur,
Blaine-Logan, McKinley-Hobart, Mc-
Kinley-Roosevelt, Taft-Sherman in
1912, Harding-Coolidge, Willkie-Mc-
Nary, Dewey-Bricker, Dewey-War-
ren, Eisenhower-Nixon, Nixon-Lodge.
In 1896 the East fought bitterly
against the nomination of McKinley
because of the Ohio man's protection-
ism and his record on silver.
The economic divisions which have
principally caused this conflict have
been the financial and commercial
interests of the East and the manu-
facturing and agricultural interests in
the West. The latter have tradition-
ally favored protection; the former,
more international trade. The intel-
lectual interests in the East have
been in tune with the economic af-
fairs of their section. But they have
clothed their concern in favoring
worldwide ties of various sorts.

**WESTERNERS WIN MOST**

The drift toward two wars followed
this divisive line, because of Europe's
influence on Eastern opinion.
Since the birth of the Republican
Party there have been candidates of
that party in 27 Presidential elec-
tions. In those years a Western Re-
publican has won twelve and lost six
times. An Eastern-oriented candidate
has won four and lost five elections.
Defeated Eastern candidates have
been Blaine, Hughes, Willkie, and
Dewey twice. The winners were TR,
Coolidge, and Eisenhower twice.
This division was most obvious in
1952 when Robert A. Taft was the
favorite of the West and the East tri-
umphed with Eisenhower.
And now the fight is on again, with
Eastern political leaders and other
interests frantically looking for some-
one to stop Goldwater.
A very perceptive friend of mine,
Hugh Morton of Fall River, has
pointed up, in a letter to me, the
quite different prospect for 1964 com-
pared with 1952. At that time, the
anti-Taft forces were greatly helped
because there were Republican gov-
ernors in Pennsylvania, Maryland,
New Hampshire, New Jersey, and
Connecticut. And, above all, there
was Dewey in New York, who was
the Eisenhower field commander.
These governors controlled many
votes in the convention. In Massachu-
setts the pro-Eisenhower people were
Senator Lodge; Christian Herter, a
candidate for governor; Sinclair
Weeks, the Republican Finance
chairman, and Senator Saltonstall.
Now, Morton points out, there is only
Saltonstall left. But the crowning as-
set of the Eastern forces was a candi-
date who was a national war hero.

**POOR PROSPECTS**

Now, as Morton says, there are
Republican governors only in New
York and Pennsylvania, while Demo-
crats sit in the statehouses in the
other states mentioned. And instead
of a candidate of Eisenhower's re-
nown, the Easterners have candidates
who are able but not willing and
willing but not nationally known or
popular. The impoverished condition
of the Eastern interests was illustrated
when Eisenhower did or did not, ac-
cording to the latest bulletin from the
oracle at Gettysburg, suggests Lodge
as a possibility. This suggests that the
list of anti-Goldwater possibilities is
very short indeed. For the suggestion
of Lodge, considering where he is,
what his views are, and how badly he
fumbled his assignment on the 1960
ticket, is preposterous.
The decline of the East is also
marked by a lag in the rate of popu-
lation growth and business growth.
Most of all, the articulate voices in
the politics of the West are demand-
ing this year a real choice between
the party candidates. They are tired
of Eastern compromising.
