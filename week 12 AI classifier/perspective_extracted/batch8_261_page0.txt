**The Wisdom of a Ghost**

Of all the experts, editorial writers, columnists and inside men who are telling us of the significance of the recent election, the wisest is a ghost. Not the kind of a writing ghost of whom we hear so much these days, but a spirit, too much neglected, which must have paced the echoing rooms of Monticello uneasily these past two or three years and which, as the people voted on November 8th, must have derived a melancholy satisfaction from the verdict. For the truth that was vindicated in last week's election was not Republican: it was Jeffersonian.

Jefferson knew how to build a political party. His sagacity created one that prevailed for a quarter of a century. That was pragmatic proof. His name lived on in Democratic oratory as a symbol of party success. But the rationale of his strategy was relegated to the musty realms of political philosophy—too highbrow for a brave and foolhardy new political order. Jefferson believed profoundly that the backbone of the democratic political party—in fact the backbone of a democratic state—must be the independent farmer and all of the small property owners scattered through the nation who would resist too-rapid change, insist upon decentralized government, prevent the growth of autocracy and hold in check the malleable, mobile, easily controlled masses of the cities. For a long time he opposed the development of industrialism solely because he foresaw its influence upon the growth of cities and the rise of proletarianism. He feared, as one who had seen at first hand the beginnings of the French Revolution, the emotional instability of men in the mass. Hence his party was to be built of free, independent, small property owners. These he cozened with as sugary praise as any master politician of modern times and, of course, many of his pronouncements must be discounted, to some degree, because they were not measured expositions of his philosophy but political arguments, and hence oversimplified, exaggerated and euphemistic. But the essence of his belief and his technique are unmistakable, and it produced a virile, stable party.

Working on the basis of just this philosophy, Louie Howe managed the youthful Franklin Roosevelt's first campaigns in Dutchess County. Roosevelt's elections to the State Senate were the result of a conscious agricultural rather than an urban appeal. Howe and Roosevelt repeated the strategy when Roosevelt ran for Governor of New York. It was never out of their minds for a moment as they laid out his state policies. It was the guiding principle of the pre-convention campaign. And it bore fruit when the nomination came to Roosevelt in 1932 from the delegates of rural America against the stubborn opposition of the delegates from industrial states. The heart of the 1932 appeal was a real farm program. The great popularity of the New Deal of 1933 and 1934 was rooted in a rising farm income.

But while Henry Wallace struggled valiantly and intelligently with farm problems, and while the gentle rain of checks continued to flutter from the Federal Treasury on to the broad fields of the farmers, the Administration became more preoccupied with urban questions. Holding-company legislation, social security, slum clearance, the problems of organized labor, the WPA and other interests of only indirect importance to rural America held the center of the stage. Spending mounted; a mayors' lobby hovered over Washington; little business was hit by the surplus tax; the Administration failed to speak out resolutely on new and destructive labor tactics; and Roosevelt, always theretofore a bit fearful of big city crowds, out-stripped Al Smith as a master of crowd psychology.

Some of us called attention to these facts early in 1936 and were pooh-poohed for our pains. Yet the tide of Roosevelt popularity began to ebb visibly early in 1936.

Landon conspicuously failed to catch it, utterly failed to dramatize it, and the great majorities of that November obscured it. The High Command of 1936 forgot all about Jefferson's philosophy and Louie Howe's wise strategy. It grabbed votes where they grew in bunches. In cities, bosses were placated, mayors were given the honor of announcing large Federal grants for public improvements, Negroes *en masse* were wooed away from the Republican party, little labor parties were formed, the C.I.O. was embraced, radicals and fellow travelers who had distrusted Roosevelt in 1932 suddenly made the discovery that he was a new Messiah.

Out of this new way of doing things came the victory of 1936. But muffled by the great majorities of that year were small, ominous voices of protest. Strange as it may seem, Roosevelt lost strength in 58 per cent of the counties of the country between 1932 and 1936. Plotted on a map, these counties showed great areas in the Mississippi Valley and in the border states turning away from Roosevelt back into the Republican ranks.

Again there were those who held up a minatory finger. Political strategists high in the Democratic organization compiled incontrovertible figures to support their warnings, but the ears of the general headquarters were deafened by the crowds that had greeted Roosevelt in Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland and Madison Square Garden. Later on the sage Garner warned the President that the folks back home, the farmers and the little businessmen, were troubled about government "spendin'" and about the C.I.O. But the "well-integrated group," as it likes to call itself, around the President dubbed Garner a "reactionary," an "alarmist," and the merry dance went on. The Supreme Court was attacked; Black was appointed; the Reorganization Bill was pressed; and finally the purge was started.

Even the defeat of the purge taught the W.I.G. ("well-integrated group") nothing. They invited the crushing, devastating defeat of last week. And they deserved it. The attempt to build a party upon Left-wing labor, populism, relief and city boss-ism has failed. Jefferson was right. Howe was right. The W.I.G. was wrong. The new Roosevelt of 1936-1938 was wrong.

To be sure, there were many incidental factors that contributed to that demonstration. The normal reaction, the "let's have a change" sentiment, the fear that the President was seeking too much power, the resentment at the use for political purposes of money appropriated to alleviate human misery, the failure of the President to choose between conflicting points of view among his subordinates, the neglect of seasoned and experienced Democratic leaders, the needless harrying of business—all of these helped.

But the failure to observe Jefferson's uncannily shrewd political technique and the failure to proceed on the basis of Louie Howe's skillful adaptation of it to modern conditions transcends all of these. I wish that the genius of such a dramatist as Robert Sherwood, who has so masterfully rescued Lincoln from mythology in his great play "Abe Lincoln in Illinois" would play upon the real Jefferson, not alone the man of ideals, but the consummately clever and resourceful and successful American political leader. The country needs to know him better. The leaders of his party forgot him. And the loss was theirs.
