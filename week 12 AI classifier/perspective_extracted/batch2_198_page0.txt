**PERSPECTIVE**

**Destiny of a Continent**

by Raymond Moley

AN AMERICAN needs to shed none
of his patriotism if he views with
a great deal of sympathy the British
Government's doubts about our sup-
port of the United Nations' military
action in Katanga. For the explana-
tions of our officials are ambiguous
and coated with semantic frosting.
The British are old Africa hands. We
may disagree with many of their ad-
ventures of the past, but on balance,
British influence in Africa has been
beneficial to Africans and the world.
In this instance the capacity of the
British Foreign Office to appraise the
nature and consequences of the pres-
ent U.N. action is far better than that
of our more recently inducted makers
of foreign policy.

The official statements of Lord
Home have been cautiously diplo-
matic. But *The Times* in London,
which has traditionally been able to
interpret official policy, is quite frank:
"The British Government are
nonplussed by the difficulty of medi-
ating as well as by the wholehearted
American backing of the United Na-
tions military action... The British
Government... would not consider
justifiable any extension of the action
to the point of attempting to impose a
settlement... but fear that if it is
attempted anarchy would supervene
in Katanga and probably more widely
in the Congo... It is believed in Lon-
don that the strong action taken by
U Thant is partly due to the views of
Mr. Adlai Stevenson... which are
probably shared by Mr. Harlan Cleve-
land and Mr. Mennen Williams."

**'WELL-TRODDEN PATH'**

Editorially *The Times* said: "Ironi-
cally this is the well-trodden path of
colonial powers in former days. Law
and order is enforced, a 'lesson' is
taught, hostages are handed back...
whereupon the victor finds that he
must supply an administration, and,
perhaps, proclaim a protectorate. The
United Nations is equally unable to
control the results of intervention or
to predict what 'restoration of law and
order' implies... It is clear that the
United Nations is being dragged into
precisely the political intervention it
was directed to eschew."

The U.N. was in Katanga last week
with Indians and Gurkhas as a signifi-
cant part of its ground forces. Those
Asiatics are hated by the Katangans
largely because they are convinced
that their victory would mean that
Nehru would colonize the province
and exploit its rich resources.

A state of war has existed-a war
cloaked with the old futile phrase of
"limited" objectives. But war is not
controlled by smooth phrases. The
loosed dogs of war know no bounds.
The United States should know this
because it once fought a great war to
make the world "safe for democracy."
The result was neither safety nor
democracy. The dispatches last week
told of the killing of Katangan civil-
ians, the strating of agencies of mercy
and places of worship. Mining prop-
erties, the taxes on which supplied
most of the revenues of Katanga and
which would be the main support of a
larger Congo state, were being sys-
tematically destroyed. The liquida-
tion of the Tshombe government
would certainly be the outcome of
such an assault. And Tshombe him-
self, an educated, Christian anti-
Communist, may also be liquidated.

**OLD TRAGIC FUTILITIES**

Can the U.N. "brains" realize that
no viable Congo would be created
without a sound and peaceable Ka-
tanga? The masters of our foreign pol-
icy should realize that no nation is
created by external force. The British
know that, for they failed after 120
years to create a united Ireland.

The old tragic futilities are enacted
once more under the semantic screen
of creating a new free world.

Can anyone reasonably hold that
Adoula could succeed without the co-
operation of Tshombe and a peaceful
and productive Katanga? For Adoula
is now facing on his doorstep an
Orientale Province controlled by pro-
Communists who only yesterday were
in his own government.

Forsaking our most important and
dependable allies, Britain and France,
we have participated in this adven-
ture. The chaos that may well ensue
will be a hunting ground for Soviet
influence, an influence which may
penetrate to many other parts of Af-
rica. If such a tragic end is not to suc-
ceed this folly, we should listen to
the British voice of experience.
