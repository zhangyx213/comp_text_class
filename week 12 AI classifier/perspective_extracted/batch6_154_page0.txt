**The High Cost of Politics**

**by Raymond Moley**

FROM time to time over the past few
years I have offered in this maga-
zine various discourses, critical in na-
ture, on some of the vast reclamation
and power projects before Congress.
During the past five months I have
devoted a number of pieces to two
glaring examples of uneconomic
spending proposals, the Fryingpan
transmountain diversion in Colorado
and the Upper Colorado
storage project. The ulti-
mate cost of these two
alone, if built, would be
well up in the billions.

It is a matter of some
comfort to me to report that
both of these proposals died
in the session just ended.
In the moment of relief thus
afforded, let us ruminate a
bit on the ways of politi-
cians and bureaucrats. For both were
involved in these projects—the first, to
win elections, and the second, to con-
solidate themselves in government.
While we are at it, let us see what can
be done when these projects appear
again. For the last pitiful outcry of the
Senatorial sponsors was that they
would return next year.

The Fryingpan project reached the
floor of the House and was defeated,
195 to 188. For their part in the brief
debate that preceded the vote, tax-
payers’ thanks are chiefly due to Con-
gressmen Saylor of Pennsylvania,
Smith of Virginia, Madden of Indiana,
Yorty of California, and Donovan
of New York.

There were curious things about
the vote which can be clarified only
by a consideration of the ways of
parliamentary logrolling and mutual
back-scratching. One hundred thirty-
four Democrats and 61 Republicans
voted “No.” One hundred thirty-eight
Republicans and 50 Democrats voted
“Yes.” Many of the Republicans vot-
ing “Yes” were from the vicinity of the
Great Lakes. The Republican House
leadership put the pressure on to
keep them in line. What can these
people in the Great Lakes region have
in common with the needs of the Ar-
kansas Valley in Colorado? Could the
earlier vote on the St. Lawrence Sea-
way have anything to do with it? And
why should the party which cried out
about Truman extravagances now be
the party of the open hand? Can the
precarious state of the Colorado elec-
tion be involved?

The parliamentary history of the
huge Upper Colorado project could
be a classic story of pork-barrel legis-
lation. The bill came to the Senate
committee with a price tag of less
than a billion dollars. It came out of
that committee enlarged to $1.6 bil-
lion. Immensely expensive projects,
previously rejected by the
President and never ap-
proved by the Budget Bu-
reau, were tossed in with
reckless abandon. Only two
members of that committee,
Smathers and Clements,
come from east of the Mis-
sissippi. And only Kuchel
of California opposed it.

Kuchel’s opposition was
expressed in a most devas-
tating report and statement. The bill
was laid aside in the rush at the ses-
sion’s end, and the companion House
bill died in the Rules Committee.
There is now barely time for a re-
port by the Hoover commission on the
general subject of reclamation, which
has for years been in need of a gen-
eral overhauling. The plain fact is that
for the most part irrigation, at present
costs and under modern conditions,
when applied to arid and semi-arid
regions is a fantastically expensive
way to raise food and fiber. With a
few notable exceptions, the projects
financed by the Federal government
since it went into the business in 1902
have been either failures or most ex-
pensive luxuries at Federal expense.

IT IS important to get this over to the
taxpayers in such states as New
York, Pennsylvania, California, Illi-
nois, Ohio, Michigan, and Texas, who
must foot most of these bills. Business
and labor groups in all states can make
common cause in this educational
process. There are taxpayers’ groups
that can wield a great deal of in-
fluence, and in the Upper Colorado
fight such organizations in Oklahoma
and Missouri did valiant service.

The politicians who spend our
money and seek to shape our destiny
should be made to hear, over the
clamors of regional minorities, the
clear demands of the majority. For
the taxpayers, the Lord help them,
are the majority.
