Taxation, The Great Destroyer
by RAYMOND MOLEY

IF Governor Dewey had, in 1948, as
sharply drawn the issue as he has
in 1950, he would now, as President,
be in a position to put his ideas into
action. He and President Truman, in
their respective messages and as titular
leaders of their parties, have established
lines of disagreement that might well
give the voters later this year something
for which they might vote with zest and
effectiveness.

They have, whether they meant to or
not, largely drawn the issue on the subject
of taxes. For unless the President develops
a means of raising more reserves, his socialistic
programs will be meaningless. That is, unless
he intends to pay for new adventures in
welfare with borrowed money and thus adopt
deficit spending as a permanent policy. For
we have only to apply his new-found wishing
stone to his own activities to reveal what might
happen in A.D. 2000. His method is to apply
the rate of increase over the past half century
to the next. Suppose we should apply that
method of prediction to the size of the Federal
budget or the number of Federal employes.
Federal expenditures would be about
$6,000,000,000,000, or six times the
President's estimated national product. There
would be 20,000,000 civil employes of the
Federal government. The national debt would
be-oh, you figure it out.

Dewey, however, raises a question that bears
with great pertinence upon longtime trends in
government. His question deals with the increasing
degree to which the Federal government is seizing
the tax sources available to the states, taking
money out of states and returning a fraction in
the form of grants-in-aid. If this increase continues,
Dewey says, it will "impair the sovereignty of a
state and deprive it of the finances with which to
meet its own responsibilities." This is a masterpiece
of understatement. This trend would destroy state
government.

DEWEY points out that in 1941 the Federal
government took $1,500,000,000 from New York
State in taxes and now takes five times as much.
The Federal government takes eight times as much
in taxes in New York State as does the state itself.
Meanwhile, Dewey continues: "Washington moves
to lull us into a state of complacency by holding
out increased Federal grants-in-aid as a substitute
for our self-determination."

In reply to this, the neo-Federalists in Washington
will say that, since New York is a great financial
center, it must bear a disproportionate burden of
Federal taxes. But the nationwide situation reveals
the same dangerous trend of grants-in-aid. In 1902
the amount of Federal grants-in-aid was about
$3,000,000. It is now, according to Dewey, approaching
$2,000,000,000. If we were to carry the Truman
fantasy of the year 2000 into this matter, we might
envision the total in that year at $1,300,000,000,000
in grants-in-aid.

But let us look at the visible trend. According to a
tabulation prepared by the United States Bureau of
the Budget, the total of Federal grants to the states
for 1930 was $102,608,000. In 1940 it was
$693,072,000. In 1945 it was $624,510,000. Then,
under postwar conditions, it really began to rise,
until, for the present fiscal year it will probably
reach the figure mentioned by Dewey.

DEWEY approaches this problem, as did the Hoover
commission, on the basis of having the Federal
government relinquish to the states and localities
sufficient tax sources to permit them to raise their
own money and pay for their own services. The
governor mentions two in particular-gasoline and
amusement taxes-which should be given to the
states. These would provide about $1,000,000,000
which should be cut away from Federal grants.
Then, the remaining Federal grants should be
apportioned among the states according to "proven
need and fiscal capacity." He adds: "moving in that
direction taxing power and self-determination would
return to most of our states."

This is real advice, not only to the Republican Party
but to everyone who fears the danger of centralized
government. For, as John Marshall said long ago:
"The power to tax involves the power to destroy."
