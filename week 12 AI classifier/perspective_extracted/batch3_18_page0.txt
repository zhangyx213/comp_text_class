**Ford for Vice President?**

by Raymond Moley

IT WAS very significant that in a NEWSWEEK poll to determine the ablest members of Congress taken in June, Gerald Ford Jr. of Michigan, along with Minority Whip Arends, ran second only to Minority Leader Halleck. The votes of the 50 Washington correspondents who participated were Halleck 27, Ford and Arends 25, Judd of Minnesota 20, and Byrnes of Wisconsin 18. There was more support in the poll for the Republicans named above than for any House Democrat except Speaker Sam Rayburn.

This expression of appreciation for Ford, who holds no office in the House except ranking member on a subcommittee, is especially noteworthy because no group of individuals, except the members themselves, live more closely with the work of Congress than those correspondents. And close contacts with the members enable reporters to know the esteem with which colleagues regard the people with whom they work. On Feb. 13 I wrote here that Ford would be a splendid choice for second place on the National Republican ticket. This poll confirms that judgment.

Ford was elected to the House in 1948 with a 27,000 majority. His vote has risen in the years since. His career in public life was initiated by his uncle and foster father Gerald Ford, a respected attorney and civic leader in Grand Rapids, and by the late Senator Vandenberg.

**RECORD IN CONGRESS**

Ford is a member of the Appropriations Committee and of the House Republican Policy Committee. While he ranks fifth among the minority members he is given considerable responsibility by the veteran John Taber. He is ranking member of the important subcommittee on defense. His knowledge of that subject would be invaluable to the Republican ticket in a year like this. Chairman Byrnes of the Republican Policy Committee designated Ford as head of a study group on “American Strategy and Defense” which has just issued a most important and informative report. This might well be the basis of the Republican platform.

Ford should be most acceptable to the probable candidate, Vice President Nixon, as a running mate. Nixon has specified that he wants a man who would be entirely in sympathy with his policies, who would be sufficiently articulate to represent him at home and abroad, who would assist him in carrying the immense burdens of the Presidency, and who is vigorous enough to carry such a load as he, himself, has carried for President Eisenhower. Ford would amply meet those specifications.

**COLORFUL BACKGROUND**

Moreover, since, as Woodrow Wilson said, a President is ipso facto leader of his party, Ford could be of immeasurable help in the task of strengthening the Republican Party in years to come.

His qualifications as a candidate include forceful speaking ability and an abundance of colorful background. He is 47 years old and after graduation from the Yale Law School practiced law. He served 47 months in the Navy with distinction. At the University of Michigan he was a member of one of that institution’s great football teams. He was named in 1959 a member of the All America 25-year team. At the Yale Law School he was an assistant football coach and freshman boxing coach.

There are many who are talking about Senator Goldwater for Vice President. But the brilliant senator from Arizona can be of more usefulness where he is, rapidly becoming the most articulate exponent of conservative principles in the Senate and over the country. There is also support for Ambassador Lodge. But he is most valuable in foreign affairs, and the next Vice President should carry some of the burden of the President’s domestic responsibilities since there will be demands on the Chief Executive for much traveling abroad. Ford would get on better with Congress than anyone in sight.

It is time for both parties to recognize that after the experience with Sherman Adams, no appointed Presidential Assistant can succeed. The constitutional and elective office of Vice President should be used to lighten the constantly growing tasks of the President.
