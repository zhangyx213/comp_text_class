**Lessons From the Primaries**

Democratic primaries persist in
going Democratic. Men in office are generally being approved by the voters of their
party. This applies both to unquestioning
followers of the President as well as to
those who have defied him.

As I pointed out on this page a week ago, the distinction must be made between the attempt to keep a man in
Congress and the attempt to put one out.
It is clearly within the proprieties for the
President, if he chooses, to say a good
word about the record of a man who has
been in Congress over a period of years,
and this applies to such bits of praise as
he has extended to Barkley, Bulkley,
Thomas and McAdoo. But for the President to oppose a member of his own
party merely because he has failed to
smack down the rubber stamp every time
the call has come from the White House
involves a fundamental difference in
principle. And it is a tribute to the voters
that they have been more scrupulous in
the observance of this principle than the
political neophytes in Washington who,
a little while ago, declared that they were
going to purge the party.

The Barkley affair involved no question
of purging. It did, however, involve the
reprehensible practice of using money
appropriated for the relief of human suffering for political purposes and, because
it did, it is unfortunate that decent principles of politics might not have been served
by the defeat of Senator Barkley, the
beneficiary of this streamlined spoils
system. But Barkley's victory gives new
life to a belief held by many that political
logic will bring Mr. Roosevelt to select
Barkley as his successor—when he decides
not to run again.

Meanwhile, the silly excursion of the
purging cabal into the Virginia primaries
met the rebuff it deserved. A green boy
tried, on the basis of a slavish declaration
for Presidential policies, to defeat an experienced member of Congress, in a district where the tradition of Jefferson,
Marshall and Madison is still vibrantly
alive. He failed.

A year ago, a well-informed Missourian
said that by long tradition his state prefers a man who stands on his own feet
and refuses to surrender his independence
to the White House. Senator Bennett
Clark, whose independence has been one
of the major thorns in the side of executive
power in Washington, carried every one of
the 114 counties in the State of Missouri
and every one of the 28 wards in St.
Louis. This demonstration of political


strength, considered in the light of the
unquestioned talents of Senator Clark,
ought to flash a warning to those who are
planning to use the 1940 convention to
continue the "revolution."

It will, sooner or later, be borne in upon
the dense fog of self-assurance that seems
to prevail in Washington that the people
of this country simply do not like 100 per
cent support of any individual. Dr. George
Gallup has just published the results of a
poll of this question, and 77 per cent of the
people of all states and all ranks have
voted that they do not want any such
blind subservience on the part of their
Congressmen. The rout of the purgers
continues apace.

**Cárdenas Sows the Wind**

Secretary Hull's note to Mexico
on July 21 clearly shows growing apprehension on the part of Washington as to the
domestic and international crisis that is
developing in Mexico. It was a fair and
well-reasoned argument. It was also sharp
and to the point.

The rules of international law, said Mr.
Hull, clearly require "adequate, effective
and prompt compensation" for property
belonging to foreigners which is expropriated by the government. Failure to
provide prompt compensation is confiscation, pure and simple. Anticipating the
claim of Mexico that the lands were seized
in pursuance of a program of reform, Mr.
Hull added that, however noble the
Mexican objectives may be, they are
not related to the simple question of fair
dealing between two friendly nations. The
United States has also been working on a
program of social reform, he said, but it
has, in every case, carried out its purposes
within the framework of international
comity. He dryly reminded Mexico of
benefits that our neighbor at the south has
received from this country in the past few
years and wound up by suggesting that the
whole question be submitted to arbitration.

Mexico's reply, dated August 3, was
simply a head-on denial. Mexico claims
that there is no rule in international law
that requires "immediate or even deferred" compensation, if the expropriations
are generally applied to Mexican owners
as well as Americans. In any event, her
own laws require compensation. Anyhow,
the American claims are not very large,
she says, and then hastens to close the
door of hope to any payment, at least for
years to come, by insisting that payment
to Mexican owners should be made at
the same time and under the same terms


that it is made to American owners. There
follows then an ingenious novelty in international thinking: Mexico refuses arbitration on the wholly specious ground
that the differences involved are not
irreconcilable. And finally, as though these
half-contradictory arguments were not
sufficiently irritating, the Mexican note
falls back upon an alibi that has grown
strangely familiar in the United States
these past years: there are only a small
number of American claimants, in any
case, and these are selfish people who
bought property in Mexico for "only
lucrative ends."

At the end of the Mexican note is a
familiar line of strategy that has characterized the Mexican policy for a long
time—a sort of mañana policy. It suggests
the appointment of representatives by
each country to determine the value of
the properties affected and the manner of
paying for them. The Mexican Government is willing to begin a discussion along
this line at once. Nothing is said about
how many years such a discussion could
be prolonged.

All of this is important not only in
so far as it indicates what Mexico intends
to do about American oil claims but as it
affects the safety of American investments
throughout the world. Acceptance of the
fantastic doctrine advanced by Mexico
would clearly be the signal for similar
expropriations in at least half a dozen
countries. Beyond this, we must also consider the reaction the present Mexican
policies will meet in European nations,
in view of the immense European claims
upon that country, and the upheaval that
is likely to occur in Mexico itself if the
excesses of the Cárdenas government do
not come to an end.

Despite the surface brashness of the
Mexican note, its overtones suggest the
mounting desperation of the Cárdenas
government. Some of the elements which
have contributed to Mexico's impending
economic and political chaos were described on this page a week before Secretary Hull dispatched his note. The denunciations which I subsequently received
were not wholly surprising. Typical was
a severe upbraiding by the radical writer
Mike Gold in The Daily Worker. Mr.
Gold frothed over both my piece and one
which appeared a little later in Collier's
under the authorship of George Creel.
After a number of contemptuous personal
references, Mr. Gold suggested what
might happen to Mr. Creel and myself
under a Communist regime: "How can
any American liberal doubt the Moscow
trials of the traitors," he said, "when here
are two fine, plump, functioning specimens
of liberal treachery in their own midst?"
Which merely illustrates what every objective observer of the present regime in
Mexico has known for a long time. To
criticize Cárdenas is to invite answers
from American Reds: the Cárdenas aims
are their aims.
