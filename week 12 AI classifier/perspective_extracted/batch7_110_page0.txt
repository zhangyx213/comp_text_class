**Freedom From Responsibility**

by RAYMOND MOLEY

SANTA BARBARA—A firsthand look at the old-age-pension and general-benefits situation in Washington, Oregon, and California has confirmed an old conviction of mine that the greatest menace to the stability of this country is warmhearted but soft-headed reform. Two reform movements whose origins were, years apart, have merged in a trend that is already a menace to solvent government.

The first of those reforms was the initiative and referendum, hailed 40 years ago as a means of giving government back to the people. It now looks as if it might be a means of giving this part of the country back to the Indians. The second reform developed from the legitimate responsibility of the state to care for the indigent aged.

Last year, while public interest was concentrated in the Presidential election, the professional pension promoters won smashing victories in these three states. In Washington, under the expressed objectives of "freedom from want and freedom from fear," a citizens' security act was passed which not only raised old-age benefits to a minimum of $60 per person per month but instituted a broad program of government medical care. In the first two years the cost will be $200,000,000. Under the Washington law there is no compulsion upon children, however able they may be, to contribute to the support of their parents. Moreover, there is specifically outlawed any lien on the estates of those assisted for the repayment of benefits.

UNDER earlier laws in some of these states, it was provided that when the direct beneficiaries died their property could be levied against by the state for the recovery of some of the assistance given in their old age. It was reasoned that it was manifestly unfair to the state to have property pass to a well-to-do distant cousin in another part of the country.

In Oregon a comprehensive act was voted last year. It guaranteed a minimum of $50 and carried with it the immunity from responsibility of children and any state lien. The attorney general of the state, however, declared the law unworkable and held that the legislature could revise it. This has been done rather thoroughly, but the pension people have already taken steps to refer the revision to the voters this fall. Whatever the outcome then, the provisions of the act passed by the legislature for some compulsion upon children and relatives will stand. But the burden on the state will inevitably be about a fifth of the available revenues.

The California law is in the form of a complicated constitutional amendment passed at the last election. This, of course, is binding upon the legislature and the governor. It dropped the age requirement from 65 to 63, increased the minimum provision from $60 to $75 a month, made old-age expenditures a prime claim on the state revenues, and made the administrator of the system an elective office. A fantastic provision of the law carried the name of the first administrator. Thus to write into a constitution the actual name of a person to hold an office is a governmental oddity which could hardly be imagined except in California. The cost of this amendment, as estimated in the governor's budget, will increase state expenditures $120,000,000 in the first year and a half.

SINCE this preferred charge takes a heavy toll from sums now needed for education and other normal state activities, there will be strong support for a repealing amendment which has already been initiated. The vote will come this fall. If the new measure passes, there will be a vote on the repeal of the repeal next year—and probably so on eternally.

It is a rather strange coincidence that all these states have Republican governors, none of whom favor the measures that were enacted by the same voters who elect governors and legislatures. In this perverted form of popular government, public officials become more and more mere ceremonial objects and historical monuments to mark the place where representative government once prevailed. Freedom from official and personal responsibility becomes the fifth freedom of the welfare state.
