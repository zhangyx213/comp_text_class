**The Vital First Years**

by Raymond Moley

MONTPELIER, VT.—This month hundreds of thousands of young people are enrolling in college, many for the first time. Parents pause, pen and checkbook in hand, to consider what is ahead. My suggestion is that they realize that the first two years are likely to be decisive. Only a little over half the freshmen will graduate—61 per cent of the boys, and 48 per cent of the girls. Many will regret in later years the diversions and the courses with little relevance to their later life. Last week in this space I listed some of the problems and shortcomings of the four-year liberal-arts colleges, their students, and faculties. Largely because of these, there has grown to maturity over the past 60 years the two-year "junior" college designed to round out and conserve what may be the end of the beginning, or the beginning of the end, of formal education. A third of our institutions of higher learning are junior colleges attended by a quarter of our students. More than half of them are public and tax-supported. The rest are private. This piece concerns the latter.

Some junior colleges were formerly four-year institutions where, for a variety of reasons, the final two years were amputated. Public institutions predominate in the Middle West and West. But in New England several originated in sectarian "seminaries" when good public high schools were scarce. I have selected Vermont College, here in Montpelier, to illustrate what a good junior college does and can do.

**A GOOD JUNIOR COLLEGE**

This college today materializes the educational ideals of a wise, competent, conservative, experienced educator, Dr. Ralph E. Noble, who ten years ago resigned as Vermont's Commissioner of Education to become its president. The foundations were laid in 1865 as "The Vermont Conference and Female Seminary" by members of the Methodist clergy. Later it became Montpelier Seminary for young men and women. In 1941 it became Vermont Junior College, and in 1953, Vermont College. Its student body consists of about 325 young women. In these ten years, with the aid of individuals and local financial institutions, a group of fine buildings have been built which combine simplicity, utility, and rare beauty and taste. The college stands on a hill at the edge of the state capital.

The curriculum is designed to meet the needs of three classes of students: Those who will transfer after graduation to a four-year liberal-arts college; those who neither want nor need more than two years, and those whose purpose is to combine some liberal-arts courses with preparation for a specific vocation. For the latter, preliminary training is provided for teachers of nursery schools, for secretarial assistants for physicians and dentists, hospital laboratories, and public-health offices. Graduates receive the degrees of Associate in Arts or Associate in Science.

**YOUTH PLUS MATURITY**

About 25 per cent of the graduates transfer to some form of advanced education. Of these, most go on in liberal-arts colleges, others continue their vocational training. Many four-year colleges welcome such transfers to help fill the ranks thinned by failures and dropouts. Students from the local region or even Vermont are in the minority. The larger number of students come from New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Connecticut.  "The junior college," says Dr. Noble, "has been in existence long enough to have proven policies, but not yet so long as to be enslaved by tradition. It is old enough to bear mature responsibility, yet young enough to respond readily to the changing character of American life. Its ideal is the effective citizen, able to contribute constructively to the civic, economic, spiritual, and cultural life of the community."

This college is for women. But the general pattern applies with equal pertinence to young men. A two-year college provides an alternative to the overextended, presently experimental, and expensive offerings of many four-year institutions or a preparation for the final two years of same. With military service looming for most young men, two good years of college may be a solution to their serious problem.
