**Fourth Estate First**

by RAYMOND MOLEY

Two weeks ago, there appeared
in this column an estimate of the out-
come of the Congressional election.
That estimate was based on the situa-
tion as it stood on Oct. 25, eleven days
before election. It said: "As this
article is written, it seems to me that
… Republicans will elect no less than
226 members of the House and that
Republicans will gain seven seats in
the Senate … If, however,
a trend, substantial but not
of landslide proportions,
runs toward the Republi-
cans in the days before the
election, Republicans will
elect 248 House members
and will control the Senate
by gaining twelve or thir-
teen seats." My article then
specified the states in which
the House and Senate gains
were to be expected and
the specific number in each state.

It became obvious, in the days that
followed, that the trend was continu-
ing. The latest figures are 246 House
seats and a Republican gain of twelve
seats in the Senate.

I call attention to the approximate
accuracy of these estimates not to
claim any personal credit, but to make
acknowledgment to those who were
really responsible and to describe the
method by which they were made.

My survey was conducted on a
state-to-state and district-to-district
basis. Its major sources of information
were individuals, from coast to coast,
who had expert and intimate knowl-
edge of local conditions and who free-
ly and generously gave me the bene-
fit of their judgments.

The number of those consulted runs
well over a hundred. I talked with
them in their own cities in July, Au-
gust and September and over the tele-
phone in the last weeks of the cam-
paign. In most cases, they were ex-
perienced political reporters on news-
papers; in some, they were political
leaders-not candidates-who talked
freely off the record. My final judg-
ment was a synthesis of their several
judgments.

In the case of the newspapermen,
the political complexion of their
papers and their own preferences had
no effect on their estimates as they
were given to me. Many of those who
predicted the largest Republican gains
were New Dealers by conviction. Their
faith was that of the true report-
er-objectivity, fairness and accuracy.
Their generosity was no less
marked than their objectivity. They
gave me precious hours of their time.
In some instances, I called them again
and again, as the campaign pro-
gressed. They were infinitely patient
with my inquisition into complex and
significant details of local situations.
They gave me everything they had.
It must be emphasized
that they were giving me
the stock off their shelves.
A newspaperman's prop-
erty is what he knows, what
experience has taught him,
what friendships with pub-
lic figures he has made over
the years and what his in-
tuition tells him. These men
and women held nothing
back; the results show that.
The rules of a materialistic
age have not yet curbed the real re-
porter's love of his trade and his deep
instinct of workmanship.

In addition to newspapermen, I
had the opportunity to consult politi-
cal leaders of both parties in various
states. They must, for obvious rea-
sons, be nameless here. They were, in
private conversation, wise, realistic
and helpful.

The best political reporters and
practical politicians have no magic
formula in assaying political condi-
tions and trends. From time to time,
students of politics have tried to emu-
late natural scientists by seeking in-
fallible and scientific methods of meas-
urement. Polls have their part in the
drawing of conclusions. But the pre-
cise instruments still remain undevel-
oped. Personal contacts, varied opin-
ions, information about economic and
social conditions gathered from many
sources-all weighed against preju-
dice, personal interest and other psy-
chological factors-these are the best
working tools. But politics is not the
only inexact science. Even in surgery,
medicine and engineering, the final
determinant must be the experienced
judgment of the practitioner. There is
no substitute anywhere for experience
and hard work.

Political predictions are always
dangerous and difficult. In the long
run, a journalist can best serve his
readers by interpretation and by re-
porting the facts. That, and not
prophecy, will be the permanent ob-
jective of this column.
