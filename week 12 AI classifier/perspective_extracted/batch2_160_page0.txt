**Monroe Doctrine Today—I**

**by Raymond Moley**

IN A characteristic campaign outburst, Harry S. Truman said two weeks ago: "The reason we're in trouble in Cuba is that Ike didn't have the guts to enforce the Monroe Doctrine." It will serve no purpose in the crisis that we face in Cuba to reply that until Castro had deliberately proclaimed himself to be a Communist any application of the Monroe Doctrine would have been quite inappropriate. It is true that Castro's allegiance to the Communist system should have been known to the Eisenhower Administration well before he gained undisputed control of the island republic. Our two ambassadors there learned about it, but were not permitted by the State Department bureaucracy to tell their story to Secretary Dulles and President Eisenhower. But even then it would have been difficult legally to sustain the assertion that an alien system had been imposed from without. The Soviet take-over has been consummated since President Eisenhower left the White House.

Without in any way presenting an excuse for the paralysis which has characterized the Kennedy Administration since the Bay of Pigs affair, a number of considerations qualify the direct application of the doctrine proclaimed nearly 140 years ago.

**CHANGED CONDITIONS**

My space here does not permit a detailed account of the nature and various applications of the principle established by President Monroe and his Secretary of State, John Quincy Adams. The reader is referred to the easily accessible and brilliant article by Charles Evans Hughes in the Encyclopaedia Britannica.

A considerable number of Americans believe, with Khrushchev, that the Monroe Doctrine is dead. This belief is based upon several developments since World War I.

The Monroe Doctrine asserted this as a major premise: "In the wars of the European powers in matters relating to themselves we have never taken a part, nor does it comport with our policy so to do." The argument follows that we have within half a century participated in two European wars and that, as the aftermath of the most recent one, we have powerful military installations in Europe designed not only to protect Europe from Soviet aggression but also to serve as a means of defending the United States itself.

Another point urged against the unilateral application of the Monroe Doctrine to Cuba is that we have involved ourselves in treaties and other obligations which act as legal restraints—NATO, the Organization of American States, and also the United Nations. In the light of these changed conditions, it is suggested that in our efforts to establish collective security we have seriously exposed our own security as a sovereign state.

**LIVING PRINCIPLES**

These considerations are, of course, well known to the Soviet, and that is why they can act so boldly in their Cuban take-over. They also realize that our Anglo-American heritage forces us to provide plausible legal justifications for every move we make to protect our security and interests. The Soviet, like the Nazi regime, and even the German Empire which invaded Belgium in World War I, have not been bound by a respect for law.

In replying to the assertion that the Monroe Doctrine is dead, several vital points can be made. One is that the Monroe Doctrine specifically said that we should regard as an unfriendly act any further colonization in the New World; also, that we should resist any introduction of an alien "system" in this hemisphere. We have repeatedly denied our desire for territorial gain, nor do we have any intention to colonize anywhere. Our bases in Turkey and Spain have nothing to do with the internal affairs of those nations. The Communist takeover in Cuba is a barefaced operation designed to establish a Communist- and Soviet-dominated state in the center of the Western Hemisphere.

What is needed is a revised doctrine, based upon the realities of the present day, which is not merely a restatement of what was said in 1823 but centered in an international principle older than the Monroe Doctrine and upon which Monroe and Adams based their own historic decision. I shall discuss that next week.
