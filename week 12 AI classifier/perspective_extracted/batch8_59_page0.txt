**Perspective**

**The Issue Is Victory**

**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

To the long list of congressmen and senators who have been renominated, despite attacks based upon disagreement with the President's foreign policy before Pearl Harbor, the name of Hamilton Fish Jr. is now added. The story has been pretty much the same everywhere—in Texas, Kansas, Illinois, Idaho and Ohio, in rural and metropolitan New York, in St. Louis and rural Missouri.

That Fish's renomination has been so widely commented upon throughout the country is chiefly due to the prominence of those who opposed him. Fish has none of the attributes that have made men important or dangerous—neither eloquence nor high intelligence nor leadership in the House. Left alone, he would have been a run-of-the-mill congressman. The President and Wendell Willkie made him a symbol of something bigger than he was.

Fish's primary success could easily have been foreseen. A month ago, a hard-bitten politician, working in the interest of a candidate for state office, made a trip through upstate New York. He told his boss to give Fish "the silent treatment" because, he said, the pre-Pearl Harbor "isolationist-interventionist" issue left the voters cold, and to make Fish the object of a statewide attack would simply give a relatively small matter an importance it did not deserve. Three months and more ago that was equally clear. The trends it indicated were noted in this column in May. Their confirmation is now before us.

Viewed in the light of political prudence, the pre-Pearl Harbor issue is a dud. It has not increased voting in the primaries. It has not caused much shift in the vote that has been cast. It is also politically dangerous at this time. To enter local political contests with the cry that world questions are at stake is to risk conveying to our allies and our enemies alike the impression that the people are against this war. That is not true. And most people are not going to like either the political tactic or the needless misunderstanding it threatens.

So much for politics. Now look at the ethics and reason of the thing.

There were many people in this country a year ago who were reluctant to see this country involved in war. Many of them saw our entrance as ultimately inevitable, yet hoped to put off the day because they believed we were not ready. Some thought we could help England more if we could stay out. But whatever their reason, provided it involved no sympathy for Hitler or Japan, it's obvious that to lump them all together in denunciation is neither reasonable nor fair. They were not scoundrels or traitors. They were not even all "isolationists," for some of them had spent years of their life fostering good will among nations.

When war broke over us, every sane American accepted its challenge without reservation. Those who had argued against involvement in war before regarded the issues of the past as matters to be left to the calm retrospect of historians in the peace to come. To the enemy they said that since he had drawn the sword, he should perish with it. To their onetime opponents in debate they held out their hands and declared that victory was the order of the day.

From that point on, the sons of "isolationists" and "interventionists" donned identical uniforms and stood side by side. Unity in what was essential was taken for granted. Freedom to speak on subjects of the common purpose—to discuss the effective prosecution of the war and how better to order the world after the war—was assumed. And because it is incalculably important that this unity and this freedom shall not be destroyed, bitterness and name calling are clearly out of place.

It goes without saying that members of Congress who actually hampered the effort to defend the country should be judged on that record. But the mere fact that they debated or opposed Administration policy at this or that point is not, of itself, blameworthy. Opposition and debate have always been part of the democratic process. The test of a public official now is how adequately he has supported the war effort and how well qualified he is to serve in the future.

Recently Mr. Willkie said that this campaign should be fought on the issue of "the efficiency of the war effort." That makes good sense. It poses a fair and relevant issue. And it will not leave the voters cold.
