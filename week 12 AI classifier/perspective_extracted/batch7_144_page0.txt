Politics, a Local Problem

by RAYMOND MOLEY

The best bit of common sense that
I have seen in some time is in a
letter from Hugh Morton of Fall
River, Mass. He writes: "There is one
factor that we all tend to overlook in
viewing the American scene. Politics
is a local problem."

Except for a few months between
the conventions and the election in a
Presidential year, there are no national
parties. There are no
party heads. One candidate
is President and, theoretically
at least, head of the
nation. The defeated candidate
silently licks his
wounds amid the taunts of
his party colleagues who
know after the event all he
should have done but did
not do and all he did that
he should not have done.
The dismal honor of "titular leader"
carries no authority. His voice is
muted by failure.

The defeated chairman of the national
committee is a victim of the
storm, bottom up on the beach. He
was the personal selection of the candidate,
not the choice of his party;
and since the candidate lost, the chairman
holds an empty title and usually
surveys an empty treasury. His best
course of action is to resign at the first
opportunity, slip back into his private
concerns, and let someone else take
over. His successor then talks about
the future of the party and attempts to
draw a curtain over the past.

The national committees are not
parties, nor are they real makers of or
spokesmen for party policy. In fact,
a national committee has no legitimate
right to express itself on public
policies. A former member of the Republican
National Committee, Dan
Whetstone of Montana, says the committee
"doesn't know whether it is a
sovereign body, a debating society,
or a glorified lunch club."

They center in counties, cities, and
states. They operate with little regard
to national policy. A national campaign
ties them together in a very
loose and extremely temporary confederation.
They vary in infinite degree.
Some local organizations bring
out the vote efficiently, and some are
moribund. Some enlist new and
promising recruits, and many more are
operated by selfish and sluggish
wheel horses. Many
counties and cities and
some states are substantially
one-party affairs, and what
legally exists is a closely
held group of officeholders.
This American decentralization
of political power
has been occasionally overlooked
by Presidents, usually
with disastrous results.
Wilson failed to see it when he called
for a Democratic Congress in 1918.
F.D.R. missed it in his purge fight
twenty years later. In each instance
states and congressional districts substantially
told the President to mind
his own affairs and they would mind
theirs.

It is therefore useless to speculate
about what the Republican Party
should do. There is no Republican
Party to heed advice, to make policy,
or to do anything else.

A Republican Party can grow as it
grew after the Landon nadir of 1936—
by starting back at the county line
once more. The Republican resurgence
began in the election of mayors,
county officers, and governors. Good
governors became national leaders, like
Bricker of Ohio, Stassen of Minnesota,
Baldwin of Connecticut, Dewey and
Warren. This local revival won a Republican
Congress in 1946 when, it
should be noted, no so-called national
leaders called the signals.

Then, in 1948, everything was gambled
on a fond hope of national victory.
Local tickets were neglected.
From Massachusetts to Colorado the
voters struck down the poorest Republican
state tickets that had been
presented in years and in general
elected better Democratic slates. The
national Republican ticket went down
with weak local candidates.

The Republican hope is to start all
over—in the states, counties, and cities.
