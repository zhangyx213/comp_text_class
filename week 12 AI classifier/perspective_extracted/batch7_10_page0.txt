**Texas Omen**

**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

THE Texas Legislature has adopted
and the governor has approved a
comprehensive series of amendments
to the election laws of the state. It has
been said by supporters of the new
legislation that this is the most important and far-reaching political event
in Texas in years. This may well prove
to be true. If so, national politics
will be fundamentally affected.
The new legislation has
grown out of a series of
events running back over a
number of years. From a
time almost at the beginning
of the Roosevelt regime, a
considerable number of Texans, including substantial
business and professional
men, have opposed what
they have regarded as the
socialistic implications of the
Federal government. Their efforts for
a long time were limited to protests, to
efforts within the Democratic Party on
behalf of conservative candidates, and
to occasional help to national movements opposing radical policies.

IN 1944 these people, who then became known as the Texas Regulars,
organized a revolt in the Democratic
Party. Their major purpose was to
control the Texas delegation at the
national convention that year and to
oppose a fourth term for Roosevelt.
Beyond that, there was a plan to
place on the November ballot a slate
of Presidential electors who were not
pledged to the Roosevelt-Truman
ticket. A terrific political fight resulted.
For a moment the Regulars actually
were in control, but finally the New
Deal people carried the day. They
controlled the delegation and delivered the state to the national Democratic ticket on election day as usual.
That defeat was far from the end of
the revolt, however. The men and
women who had participated as Texas
Regulars gave up the name and decided to carry on for good and conservative government without a formal
name or organization. Joined by many
other like-minded people, they have
had great influence in elections and in
the formulation of public opinion and
public policies. The people in this
movement have never entertained the
idea of joining the Republican Party.
They have felt that their greatest
contribution will be to make the
Democratic Party in Texas distinctly
conservative, to elect a conservative
legislature and conservative Democratic congressmen, and to support those
people in their home districts when
they oppose Truman policies in Congress or radical causes in the state.
They have had marked success in
attaining this objective.
The efforts of this group
as well as those of other independent citizens' groups
to gain influence in Democratic politics have been
frustrated by the Fair Deal
machine. This has been possible because of an archaic
precinct, county, and state
convention system. Thus,
the key to Texas power has
been turned in Washington.
The new election legislation completely cleans up the convention and
primary system. It makes participation
by citizens easier and protects their
rights. It should make it possible for
citizen groups who have authentic
voter backing to control the machinery
of the party.
Another feature of the new election
legislation will prevent some of the
chicanery that has gone on in remote
counties in past elections. Strict provisions are included for the accounting
of election expenditures and for prosecution by the state's attorney general.

A VERY interesting provision for cross-filing of names in primary elections is also now law. This provision, borrowed from the California law, permits
a candidate to get on the ballot under
more than one party name. It would,
for example, permit an independent
Democrat to run as a Republican as
well as a Democrat and have his
votes pooled.
The way seems to be clear now for
new leadership within the Democratic Party in Texas and to throw the
great potential of the state against the
Fair Deal in a national election. This
may or may not happen in 1952. It
will depend on the capacity of leaders
to stir conservative voters to use their
new powers. There can be no doubt
about the conservatism of the people
of the state. The question now is their
capacity to use their power against
the Federal machine.
