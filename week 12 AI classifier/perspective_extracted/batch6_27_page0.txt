**The Birth of an Industry**
by Raymond Moley

BACK in the dark years of the 1930s, when people talked of means by which we might pull ourselves out of depression, there inevitably came the comment: "If only a new industry might arise." The so-called liberals of that day deprecated any solution, and F.D.R. himself was induced to say that "the industrial plant is built." But every long step toward economic growth and higher standards of living in this country has come by the birth of vast new industries such as railroads, electric power and light, automobiles, airplanes, and other applications of internal-combustion power. In these cases the creative imagination and drive came from private individuals. The only great industry that can be attributed to government has been war or preparation for war.

But modern liberals have not learned this plain fact. They propose now that the brightest prospect for a new industry—the various developments of atomic energy for civilian purposes—shall be a government monopoly of a size and consequence that defy imagination. Such a belief in government omnipotence is always supported by the deprecation and denial of the value of private enterprise.

**THE GORE BILL**

The Gore bill, which died in the 84th Congress but which has reappeared in the 85th, and many of the speeches of candidates Stevenson and Kefauver in 1956 propose the building by the government, with taxpayers' money, of a series of atomic-power plants over the country which will produce, under the collectivist preferential clause, electricity in competition with the private power industry. The cost, according to the Gore bill, would be $400 million, and the government plants would be of various types and in various places.

This proposal for a government superstructure runs directly counter to the present provision in the law, that the Atomic Energy Commission should seek "to strengthen free competition in private enterprise." It also runs counter to the express policy of the AEC since 1948, that its purpose is to move away from government monopoly as fast as possible.

The very premise from which the Gore proposal proceeds—i.e., that private industry has been lagging—is denied by the facts.

In a comprehensive statement by Chairman Lewis L. Strauss last month before the Congressional Joint Committee on Atomic Energy there is a specific description of a new and rapidly growing "atomic-energy industry free of government monopoly." Strauss said: "The forces of traditional American free enterprise are moving forward on a broad front."

In the two years since the AEC's "access program" opened certain facts and methods to private industry there has been active development in several directions.

**RAPID GROWTH**

At least 21 American firms are building or have orders to build 59 reactors for civilian purposes. These will be for private U.S. buyers, for the Federal government, and for export. American firms have signed contracts or announced plans for nine uranium ore processing mills, a feed materials plant, five nuclear fuel element manufacturing plants, seven critical facilities, and three zirconium and two beryllium production facilities. The total cost of these will run far beyond the mark set by the Gore bill, and a great part of this will be paid by private investors' money.

One of the great contributions to medical care, agriculture, and industry by the AEC has been the making of isotopes. Forty different firms in private industry are already making use of these.

There is also the rise of a uranium mining industry. The United States is already the leading uranium producing nation of the world. Only nine years ago 90 per cent of our uranium supply came from overseas. Today 60 per cent originates in North America, and by 1958 we shall be producing 80 per cent. All of our mines, and all but one of the processing mills are privately financed and operated.

With this bright prospect of a new industry, competitive and privately operated, with hundreds of millions of investment and countless jobs, it is a poor time to impose the paralyzing grip of government monopoly.
