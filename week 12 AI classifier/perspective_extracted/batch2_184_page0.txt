**PERSPECTIVE**

**Nixon's Durable Critics**

*by Raymond Moley*

T HE celebrated Hiss case began in
1948 under the most inauspicious
circumstances. None of the members
of the House Committee on Un-
American Activities were inclined to
pay more than routine attention to
the tale of a seemingly nondescript
witness. Richard Nixon, 35 years of
age and serving his freshman term in
the House, at first shared the indiffer-
ence of his colleagues. But there crept
into his mind the trace of belief in
Chambers, then later a strong doubt
about the Hiss response. Then, with
incredible intelligence and energy,
Nixon pursued the case to its fi-
nal break.

It is the impact of this upon the
Nixon career since that will intrigue
the careful reader of the former Vice
President's book, "Six Crises." (460
pages. Doubleday. $5.95.)

The effect of the Hiss revelations
was especially shocking to three
classes of Americans.

There were the Communists here
who had been caught in their grimy
trade and frustrated by an awakened
public and a more vigilant govern-
ment. Their reaction was to use the
skills in which they are so proficient
to smear the author of their trouble.

There also were the members of
the party then in power whose Ad-
ministration had so loosely cared for
the national security. Their embar-
rassment was well illustrated by the
three reactions of President Truman.
First, the whole thing was a "red her-
ring." Then he attacked the commit-
tee. Finally he maligned Nixon as a
player of dirty politics in the cam-
paigns that followed. Other members
of the opposition party made a habit
of calling Nixon "tricky" and a char-
acter unworthy of high responsibility.


**FACT vs. THEORY**

Most interesting was the reaction
of the self-styled intellectuals. The
most painful blow which a dedicated
member of that species can suffer is
to have a carefully cultivated theory
blown to bits by an unwelcome fact.
Most ordinary people can toss a fact
out of their mental attics and replace
it with another. But an intellectual's
facts are all nicely built into a struc-
ture of philosophy. Knock out one per-
tinent fact, and the whole structure
falls like a boy's house of blocks.
The concept of Communist Russia
which those intellectuals had nour-
ished was that of a greatly exploited
people struggling toward the light of
a new society and government. Re-
spected Americans had visited the
Soviet experiment and had returned
with glowing accounts of its virtues.
These reports generally had fallen
upon the ears of a nation that was,
in the late 1920s and 1930s, contend-
ing with a great depression. The
spread of goodwill toward the Soviet
was contagious. These intellectuals,
with a few exceptions, were not Com-
munists, nor did they favor importing
the system here. But they believed
that we could watch it with profit and
cooperate with it. Later the Soviet
was our partner in a war against a
hated enemy. There was reassurance
from two Presidents who believed that
we could get on with good old Joe.

**THE AWAKENING**

This dream was rudely interrupted
by the disclosure that the Soviet was
indeed our enemy and was intent
upon our destruction. To be awak-
ened was a dreadful experience. The
intellectuals were "stuck" with their
theory, because so many had written
books and articles warmly commend-
ing the Communist experiment.

The reaction of those intellectuals
was like that of the politicians. It was
the classic decree: Kill the messenger
who bears bad tidings. The courts
had foreclosed any hope of proving
the innocence of Hiss. Nothing re-
mained but to make Nixon suffer for
what he had done. The attack of the
intellectuals followed the line of the
politicians. Nixon, despite his public
record, was "not to be trusted."

As this sort of thing seeped down
among the less sophisticated, it took
the form of Thomas Brown's verse
about Doctor Fell. I have heard in-
numerable people say they don't like
Dick Nixon, but "the reason why
[they] cannot tell."

This vague feeling was later used
by critics such as Stassen to claim that
Nixon was unpopular. And despite
34 million votes in 1960, the refrain is
still sounding on the hustings in Cali-
fornia in 1962. Such is the irrationality
of the normally rational.
