The RFC in the Rattlesnake Business
by RAYMOND MOLEY

IF PRESIDENT Truman wants to inspire
confidence in his government in
this crisis, he might engage in some
vigorous house cleaning in his own
establishment. Senator Fulbright is
bringing out in Senate hearings a series
of wretched and indefensible abuses
of government power by the RFC, an
agency which this President, as well
as his predecessor, has used as a con-
venient political grab bag.
The Lustron loan is front-
page news. A former RFC
employee says that the peo-
ple around that office were
dubious when the applica-
tion was made. But pressure
came from higher up. This
company, into which went
a loan of $37,500,000, was
bought by the government
at an auction price of less
than one-sixth of the total loan.
Everybody has heard about the
rattlesnake farm into which went a
loan and which is now a government
possession. President Truman now has
the power to declare it to be a
national monument.
When RFC director Gunderson was
asked about that loan, he is reported
to have said: "It is a small business.
And the law says we should help
small businesses."
Then there was the Reno gambling
casino-hardly a small business.
Now there is the man who got a
loan with which he paid his debts.
According to Senator Fulbright, he
had taken money from his business to
build a house, and when his creditors
pressed him, he got the money from
the RFC and paid them off. Again,
the RFC weakly excused itself,
because this was a "small business."

MANY cases have been brought out
in which the RFC has been asked
not to provide a good business pros-
pect with going capital, but to bail it
out after it had got into credit difficul-
ties. The normal rule in extending
credit would be to assume that a
business which sinks into a mire of
debt in prosperous times is not a
good prospect. But the alleged rea-
son for keeping the RFC going is to
provide loans which no legitimate
bank or individual or insurance com-
pany will touch.

It is no wonder that these loans look
bad, since the noble purpose of our
welfare state is to make bad loans.
Three and a half years ago, I pre-
sented a piece on this page entitled
"Freeze the RFC." In checking the
suggestion, I was told by Jesse Jones
that, since the RFC was designed for
an altogether different situation than
the one that then prevailed, it should
be kept in reserve with a skeleton staff
to liquidate its loans and, in
case of another depression,
to be used again. Its lend-
ing, he added, should be
limited to large public self-
liquidating projects such as
toll highways and bridges.
Sixteen months ago, I
published another piece,
entitled "The RFC That
Came to Dinner." This was
suggested by the report of
the Hoover commission task force
which recommended that no direct
loans should be made by government
except in cases of real crisis
or demonstrated need and that the
RFC business should be taken over
by the Federal Reserve Banks.

HOWEVER, in the course of the past
three years, Jesse Jones, no doubt
observing the practices into which the
institution had fallen-an institution to
which he had given thirteen years of
able service-decided for a number of
very important reasons that it could
not be salvaged. In a letter to Senator
Fulbright he says: "As to the future of
the RFC, I think it should be given a
decent burial, lock, stock, and barrel."
Concluding his letter are these words
born of long experience: "Where the
sugar is you will always find the flies."
In an earlier communication to me,
Jones noted the difficulties he had
with political pressure from Congress
and the Executive Department: "It
resolved itself, largely, to a case of
outmanaging a situation. Some years
ago a friend asked me to go deer
hunting with him in the Rio Grande
Valley. It was a little early in the
season and there had been no cold
weather and I asked him if he were
not afraid of rattlesnakes-to which
he replied: 'You can always outman-
age a rattlesnake!"

Now, apparently, with a whole
rattlesnake farm on its hands, the RFC
will get some practical experience.
