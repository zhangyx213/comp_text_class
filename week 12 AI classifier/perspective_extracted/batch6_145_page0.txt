**Pattern of Conservatism**

by Raymond Moley

THE election results should convince the President and his Congressional leaders that they can unify their party for the big battle in 1956 and get a measure of bipartisan support only on conservative terms. There were in this result eddies contrary to the conservative tide, but they can be explained on grounds which do not affect the solid national issues. And for every exception, there can be counted several instances to prove my point.

In the Far West and in the Mountain States radical candidates for the Senate went down to defeat. Glen Taylor succumbed. The leftist Carroll lost to an attractive, conservative pro-Eisenhower opponent. Yorty and Yortyism lost in California. In the seventeen states west of Omaha the Republicans actually netted one House seat.

In the East, candidates, like Lodge, who have tried to run with New Deal hares and hunt with Republican hounds, met with apathy and defeat. In New Jersey both Case and Howell were far to the left, and the large vote for Case no doubt represented people who, with a bad choice of candidates before them, supported the one who at least would help get Republican control of the Senate.

In Iowa, which almost infallibly registers Midwest farming opinion, the policies of Secretary Benson destroyed Gillette, who tried to make a case for high, inflexible support prices. In fact, all over the great agricultural areas of the country Benson proved to be an asset of priceless value. A most reliable observer in Idaho who sells goods to farmers there and in neighboring states wrote to me a week before election that the farmers he meets think Benson is a fine man who has done a fine job. When they do not agree with him, they "lay it on the line to him" and he does likewise with them, and they remain friends. Farmers still resent the inordinate power of labor bosses in the Stevenson-Humphrey-Kefauver wing of the Democratic Party. They like President Eisenhower's moderate labor attitude, just as they liked Taft's constructive labor statesmanship.

The conservative wing of the Democratic Party will be stronger than ever. The astonishing write-in victory of Thurmond shows that. It proves that Trumanism is still anathema in the South—a fact which means permanent division within the Democratic Party and the assurance in Congress of a strong conservative coalition on major issues.

Among the exceptions to the conservative trend was the election of Douglas in Illinois. This can be accounted for by the superior attractiveness of Douglas as a candidate. He is better known; he knows more about national affairs; and there are real spots of unemployment distress in the states. Barkley is Barkley, despite the ravages of age.

The Pennsylvania story is history repeating itself. A great many people in that state believe, with a great deal of justification, that the Republican machine can be trusted only so far. And it has been trusted just that far this time, perhaps farther. Misgovernment in the state cost the party the governorship, and several innocent congressmen bystanders their jobs.

The apparent election of Harriman can be attributed to the fact that a great many people who normally vote Republican in New York City either refused to vote or voted a protest. There were many reasons for this which I discussed in this space two weeks ago. One was a feeling that McCarthy has been badly treated by the Administration. Another was discontent among party workers over the lack of patronage from Washington. But the ideological pattern held in New York, as in Connecticut, by the return of incumbent congressmen. Coudert won, despite the opposition of internationalist leftist Republicans in his district.

With Congress what it will be during the next two years, the President can have a majority for sound legislation and also have peace in his own party. He cannot compromise with the left wing of the opposition. His success will depend on good relations with conservative Democrats.
