**Was the New Deal New?**

by Raymond Moley

“Such is the unity of all history that anyone who endeavors to tell a piece of it must feel that his first sentence tears a seamless web... The web must be rent; but as we rend it, we may watch the whence and whither of a few of the severed and raveling threads.” This classic expression, written by Frederic W. Maitland of the origins of English law, bears heavily upon the debate and comment of the current campaign.

Since Ike has accepted much of the early New Deal, has he thus repudiated the pre-1933 Republican Party? Is there now no choice between the two parties?

The material for answers can be found in Frank Freidel's “Franklin D. Roosevelt: The Triumph.”* This new book is the third of a planned six-volume life of F.D.R. I cannot pay it a higher personal compliment than to say that this account of the campaign of 1932 achieves something that I thought to be impossible. F.D.R. was so good for some of us and so bad for some of us that I believed it impossible that the story could be told with objectivity in our time. This is history of the first rank.


**ORIGINS**

In describing the origins of the New Deal reforms, Freidel says that in early 1932 I was given the task of assembling men and ideas for a national program. My first contributions to this were in a ten-point memorandum, which I sent to Warm Springs in May, and in F.D.R.’s speeches from April to November. The major subjects were the tariff, credit, protection of investors, agriculture, electric power, and government economy.

On the tariff, James G. Blaine’s and William McKinley’s plan for reciprocal treaties was used to keep the peace between low- and high-tariff Democrats. On credit, the concept was to lift the burden of debt upon farmers and railroads. The imaginative use of Mr. Hoover’s RFC by Jesse Jones later did the major part of the job. Investors were to be protected by Federal law modeled after the “blue sky” laws of several states. F.D.R. was won over to the


Domestic Allotment plan for farmers, the origins of which were in many conferences among many farm leaders and economists of both parties and no party. In electric power there was the concept of four Federal “yardstick” dams, one of which, the Hoover Dam, was under construction. Herbert Hoover presented the idea of basin-wide planning in 1926. Drastic reduction of government spending was reduced to form in the Pittsburgh speech, largely the work of Hugh Johnson and Bernard Baruch. F.D.R. was no believer in pump-priming spending for public works at that time. There were only general references to labor relations and international relations in the campaign.


**UNITY OF HISTORY**

The Freidel book ends with the election. In 1933 the foregoing New Deal items were supplemented and enacted into law. The TVA was the “yardstick” concept enlarged into a vast paternalism by George Norris, liberal Republican. The guarantee of bank deposits was suggested to the RFC by President Hoover and was put through in March 1933 against opposition by F.D.R. through the efforts of Jesse Jones, John N. Garner, and Senator Vandenberg. The NRA was created by Hugh Johnson out of several plans, the most definitive of which came from the president of the Chamber of Commerce of the United States. Those illustrate the essential unity of history of which Maitland wrote. The origins of the early New Deal were in both parties and in no party. The Maitland phrase, “a seamless web,” was actually used by F.D.R. to illustrate his belief in the basic unity of all economic interests. He also expressed this concept in a sentence, quoted by Freidel: “I plead not for a class control but for a true concert of interests.” That attracted many conservatives, who left in 1935 and 1936 when the first New Deal died amidst appeals to class and group.

Political expediency requires labels of a “New” Deal, a “new” Republicanism, a “new” Democratic Party—even a “new” Stevenson. Despite partisan talk, the inexorable continuity and unity of human life grasp us all and dictate the course of governments.
