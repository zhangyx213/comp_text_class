**NATIONAL AFFAIRS**

Missouri, Mr. Truman's home state, and
Kentucky, Sen. Alben W. Barkley's home,
they proposed to put up rival electoral
slates pledged to Thurmond and Wright.
They were positive of carrying Mississippi
and Alabama (20 votes). They felt the
odds were in their favor in Georgia (12),
South Carolina (8), Florida (8), Arkansas
(9), Louisiana (10), Texas (23), and Virginia (11). In Tennessee (12) and North
Carolina (14) they counted on taking
enough Democratic votes from Mr.
Truman to swing the electoral vote to
Dewey.

Even if they didn't catapult the Presidential election into the House, they were
confident they at least would enjoy the
satisfaction of having made Mr. Truman's
defeat certain.

**The Admirable Barkley**

In his 43 years in politics, Alben W.
Barkley had been the Democratic Party's
Admirable Crichton, a faithful retainer who
had seldom let pride or principle swerve
him from his duty. Like the butler in the
James M. Barrie play, he frequently had
been wiser than his masters, but he served
them all with undeviating loyalty, and
only once did he even dare to question
what they had done.

Though a fervent Prohibitionist, a leader
in the fight for the Eighteenth Amendment, he did not blink when the 1928 convention at Houston voted in favor of repeal. Instead, he seconded the nomination of Alfred E. Smith and campaigned for him vigorously. To the raised eyebrows, he gave the answer that was his Golden Rule. Party regularity, said Barkley, was the all-important issue.

Woodrow Wilson was in the White House when Barkley first came to Congress in 1913 as representative from Kentucky, after having served as McCracken County prosecutor and judge. He championed every measure of Wilson's New Freedom as devoutly as though it were his own, including the farm loan, Federal Reserve, and antitrust legislation.

In the same way, he was later to become the leading spokesman in Congress for Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal and still for Harry S. Truman. He fought doggedly for the court-packing

**Bad Faith Without Good Judgment**

**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

That Machiavelli suggested to the
Prince the priceless value of deceit
and of the disregard of promises is well
known. It is not so well known that he
added that immorality must have the
appearance of morality. And most important, that the means used must succeed.

Bad faith, hypocrisy and the appeal to sordid motives are so common in politics that they seem to be taken as legitimate tools of the trade. But a certain fastidious skill in their use has come to be expected. Immorality, when properly clothed, can pass in the market place of virtue. Because it has at least the value of restraint, of peaceful agreements, of grace and of disdain for violence and grime. But when bad management consorts with bad faith, when sharp practice exposes itself, when the hidden ace protrudes from a torn sleeve, nothing can excuse the offense. There is nothing so repellent as clumsy deception.

All of this occurred to me as I witnessed Bastille Day in Philadelphia. One great politician, who made no public appearances and who rather sadly remained almost alone in his hotel room, remarked about Truman that no President in his memory had been so badly treated by so many and with so little justification. The scramble to ditch Truman in the past few weeks was, except for the Southerners, led by people who owed the most to him. As President, he has given the Hagues, Kellys and Arveys what they have demanded. He is the

same Truman that they helped to make the Vice Presidential candidate in 1944. The Hendersons and Jimmy Roosevelts have posed as liberals and heirs of F.D.R.'s policies. Truman has advocated everything that F.D.R. left undone and, as a senator for ten years, he voted straight New Deal. And yet, these spurious New Dealers would have dropped him for Eisenhower, whose views, as far as they know, might be those of General Grant. These people showed they care more for power than principle.

In fact, the whole Eisenhower movement was phony. The great name of the general was used as a stopgap until anti-Truman sentiment could find someone else. But these promoters were too stupid to find someone else. Even Justice Douglas, to whom they later turned, was an unknown quantity. These anti-Truman people by chasing phantoms made Truman's nomination inevitable. In some cases, like that of James Roosevelt, a sworn promise to support Truman was violated.

McGrath has been a colossal flop as national chairman. He has never or seldom consulted old hands in the party. The Truman trip West was a fiasco. Truman himself has contributed to the confusion. It is freely known that it has been many months since he has called upon Barkley or Rayburn individually for consultation and advice. He did not want Barkley as a running mate nor did he, up to the day of nomination, ask him outright. Barkley has the melancholy satisfaction of running with a President, despite that man's opposition to him and despite inevitable defeat. And to fill Barkley's cup, he believes that in 1944 F.D.R. first preferred him and then dropped him for Truman.


BLUNDERING has marked the whole course of the civil-rights issue. Instead of consulting Southern leaders and soliciting their help in achieving more equality through cooperative action with the states, Truman hurled the book at Congress.

As the convention approached, Truman and McGrath tried to get a compromise in the platform. That was almost achieved when three political midgets got before the convention the offensive plank which was finally adopted. Efficient convention management could have kept that plank from a vote. When the vote came, delegates who really wanted a compromise were compelled to support it because of the pressure of minorities in their home bailiwicks.

To crown it all, the final night's welter of yapping, stalling, clowning and crowing could have been cut by 90 per cent by stronger management.

The donkey whose likeness dominated Broad Street is a maligned beast. The donkey is an efficient and trustworthy servant.
