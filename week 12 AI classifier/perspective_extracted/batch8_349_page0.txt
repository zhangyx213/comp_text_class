**TODAY IN AMERICA**

**June 5, 1937**

**BY RAYMOND MOLEY**

**UTOPIA, LIMITED**

IT'S too bad that so many intelligent columnists and
editorial writers are shrieking to the high heavens
that the wages and hours legislation which the Presi-
dent has requested heralds the coming of fascism in
this country. It doesn't, and people aren't going to
believe that it does. Responsible commentators who
do a Paul Revere act over legislation of this kind are
like the little boy who cried "wolf" too often. Their
shouts of alarm are simply discounted when really
dangerous schemes, such as the Court-packing pro-
posal, are at issue. Every element in the Court-packing
plan to which legitimate exception can be taken is
absent from this proposal. It does not tend in the
direction of personal government. It is authorized by
the mandate of the 1936 election. It is a reasonable
fulfillment of measures already undertaken by the
Federal government. This does not mean, of course,
that the bill is not hastily drafted, complicated where
it ought to be simple, simple where it ought to be
complicated and wholly illogical in several respects.

IF THE SAME Justice Cardozo who wrote the concur-
ring opinion in the NRA case should review this
measure as it stands, he would, if logic is logic and
words are words, be compelled to declare it uncon-
stitutional. But the Justice Cardozo who wrote the
majority opinions in the Social Security cases might
well find authority for it within the Constitution.

WE OUGHT NOT to look on this bill as a means of
raising wages by law. You could as easily make the
country dry by prohibiting the manufacture of liquor
in establishments employing fifteen persons or more.
This bill does not propose to attack the sweatshop,
which is usually a small concern, often a family shop,
whose proprietor contracts for orders with a jobber.
He cannot afford good quarters or high-priced equip-
ment; he cannot pay the wages of the larger concerns;
he does not have many employes. These shops are
still present in a number of the needle trades (includ-
ing knitting and some men's and women's clothing) in
the paper-box, candy and similar industries.
If these shops are not controlled, then the degree of
control over their stronger competitors cannot in
reason be very severe. The proposed Labor Standards
Board will find out quickly that you cannot raise the
wages of the cotton-spinning industry, say, and leave
unchanged the wages in the knitting industry, without
having the devil to pay.

THE BOARD, under the proposed law, can be of great
value to industry and its workers or it can become an
intolerable nuisance. To attempt to set wages with a
view solely to what is a "right" or "proper" wage
would result in atomizing some trades into tiny units
and would raise the costs in other trades to where
competing whole industries would get the business.
The balance might easily be disturbed, for example,
between cotton and rayon: the rayon industry, because
it uses more machinery and also because it is growing
f: ster, might well be able to afford a higher wage bill.


But if the Board applies steady pressure to the low-
est wages, not just to low wages, attacking small
minorities always, then it can make progress. It will
tend toward leveling wages. The people who cannot
earn more than the lowest wages will be taken out of
competition altogether and placed on relief.

THE BILL presents a number of ironic aspects. First,
though it does not apply to the little shop, it is never-
theless going to fall more heavily upon small business
than large. Second, it was drafted chiefly by a number
of disciples of Mr. Justice Brandeis who, for years,
have been advocating trust busting, the renaissance of
small business, and state experimentation in the social
and economic field. This bill is pure nationalism. It
will make big business bigger. Gigantic corporations,
such as are found in the automobile, steel and elec-
trical industries, can meet the standards it proposes to
set. In fact, they are already meeting them. It is the
little fellow who will find the going harder. And the
final irony presented by the bill is the blow which it
will deal to the Administration's efforts to decentralize
industry. Several manufacturers have already been in-
duced to set up factories in model communities fostered
by the Federal government. These establishments will
now stand as reminders of a futile effort to reverse a
trend made irresistible by the wages and hours bill.

THERE IS no justification whatsoever for the inclusion
of prohibitions against oppressive labor practices in
this bill. Such prohibitions are properly amend-
ments to the Wagner Labor Relations Act.

TO PLACE in the hands of the Board powers even ap-
proaching those which NRA attempted to exercise
would invite a repetition of NRA's collapse. Wholly
aside from the question of constitutionality, there is
the question of practicability. Congress will do well
to remember that this Board will get to work under
conditions quite unlike those which attended the birth
of the Blue Eagle. There will be no great crisis and
no great popular enthusiasm. If the Board is given
almost limitless power over the industrial life of the
nation, if it attempts to crusade, it will end by being
abolished.

THIS BILL in practice will actually do very little for
the lower third of the population. Wages will not go
up perceptibly in this country because of this legis-
lation. Very moderate results will come of it, if the
Board is wise and limits itself to tackling perhaps not
more than 1 per cent of all employers over a long
career.

But meanwhile the Roosevelt Administration will
be faced with the stark fact that it has done everything
it could think of for the "submerged" third. It will
have sprung its complete program. And its ambitious
word picture of a new utopia will remain to mock it,
unless it qualifies its promises pretty carefully, before
long.
