**King of Oberlin**
by Raymond Moley

“To be what you ought, to count as
you can, to enjoy what you may;
character, influence, happiness—these
are really worth-while.”

That is the finest description for
the good life that I have seen. It was
written by a great teacher and
churchman, Henry Churchill King. A
worthy account of his life has been
published under the title, “Henry
Churchill King of Oberlin.” Its author
is Donald M. Love, Secretary of Oberlin
College.

The Oberlin to which King came
as a student in 1877 was already
distinguished as a college of liberal
arts. Its president and professor of
theology and moral philosophy, James
Harris Fairchild, was destined to rank
as one of the foremost educators and
moral leaders of his time. King, his
most brilliant student, ultimately held
both positions and on many occasions
acknowledged Fairchild as the dominant
influence in his life. The two,
Fairchild until 1890 and King until
1927, confirmed and strengthened the
character and traditions of the college.

King’s intensity of purpose and austere
standards of personal conduct
were akin to but somewhat less rigorous
than those of Dr. Thomas Arnold
of Rugby. To both men life was very
real and very earnest. Their purpose
in education was not to teach students
how to make a living but how
to live. “God is not dictating ideal
propositions; he is educating men,”
King wrote.

**RATIONAL LIVING**

King’s character and teaching influenced
not only the thousands of
students who passed through Oberlin
but countless others who came to
know him through his multitudinous
lectures and many books. I well remember
the year when his book,
“Rational Living,” was made required
reading for every public-school
teacher in Ohio. It would not be a
bad idea for many of the new crop
of educators to examine it as a corrective
for Deweyism.

Love’s book describes in some detail
the reactions of King to the prevailing
teaching at Harvard when he
was a graduate student there. In a
letter to President Fairchild he complained
that it was difficult to find out
what the professors themselves believed:
“They are very ready to tell
you all the different views except their
own.” There have been many Harvard
students in more recent years who
have discovered that. One of them
coined a name for it, “futilitarianism.”

The spirit of reform was an essential
part of the life and traditions of
Oberlin. Long before King’s time the
college had broken the rule which
had hitherto excluded women from
higher education in America. Moreover,
it stood for certain controversial
prohibitions such as those against
smoking and drinking among the students.
King stopped an effort to introduce
fraternities, on the ground
that they were a violation of democratic
principles. I believe it was while
Wayne Wheeler was at Oberlin that
he conceived the plans for his Anti-
Saloon League. There were boyish
protests against such austerity. Once
when I asked a student library assistant
for King’s book “The Seeming
Unreality of the Spiritual Life” he
answered: “You mean ‘The Unseemly
Reality of the Spiritual Life.’”

**MEMORABLE IMPACT**

The impact of King as a public
speaker was unforgettable. There was,
Love says, “a gripping intensity in his
delivery rising above the usual quiet
persuasiveness of the speaker into
something like the oratory of the
heart. He was speaking for those for
whom he had a special responsibility,
and time was running out.”

I shall never forget King’s baccalaureate
address in 1916 when the
war in Europe was deepening into a
struggle of attrition. The tone of his
message was of grim prophecy. He
reminded his hearers that the quiet,
ordered life in which they had grown
up was gone forever and that whether
the “new civilization” was to be better
than the old depended upon the extent
to which that life was to be
governed by moral law or end in an
insensate struggle for existence.

His identification of the enemy,
many now will admit, was incorrect,
but his description of the disease,
autocracy from whatever source, has
proved to be particularly true.
