**The Republican Choice**

A fter the intensification of the
war last month, Roosevelt's popularity
rose, as was expected. Now, according to
the Gallup poll, it has leveled off. We be-
gin to see again how strong and effective
a well-informed opposition can be. High
officials in Washington are frank to ad-
mit privately that criticism on the hus-
tings, in Congress and in the press is re-
sponsible for the changes in the setup of
industrial preparedness efforts in the past
two weeks. That criticism has given us
our first stunning inkling of the immensity
of the preparedness job we face. It, and
it alone, can give us the realism to deal
with our tax problems, our cost problems
and our diplomatic problems clearly and
directly.

That is the reason why it is a momen-
tous decision the thousand-odd delegates
to the Republican Convention will be mak-
ing this June. The choice of an opposition
candidate and the formulation of the poli-
cies to which he will be bound will neces-
sarily affect our national course. They
would affect it even if Republican defeat
next November were predictable—which
it most certainly is not.

There is no evidence that the Re-
publicans, despite their mistakes in the
past, have failed to realize the gravity of
the situation. Their candidates have placed
themselves on exhibition. They have stated
their policies. The evidence is practically
all in. And it is possible for detached ob-
servers to draw a few conclusions.

The first is that the leading contenders
for the Republican nomination are all men
of integrity, of ability in their own spheres
of action, and speak, according to their
varying points of view, the language of
American patriotism. It is significant that
the frequent wisecracks with which some
of them were dismissed six months ago
have largely died out. The attack upon
them has become serious because they are
obviously men to be taken seriously. As
a group, they rate very high indeed—so
high that there is not even a remote com-
parison with any group of candidates dis-
cussed by Democrats in the past year.

In short, the Republicans have more
than a potential quarterback. They have
the makings of a first-class team. Compar-
isons would be superfluous here. Suffice it
to say that they won't be lost on the voters
at a time when the need for coordinated
ability is so appallingly clear.


Dewey, Taft, Willkie and, in a slightly
different category, Hoover and Landon
have emerged as the leading Republican
names. Their situation is roughly as
follows:

Dewey: His popularity with the rank
and file is one of the major sensations of
the political year. He has lost slightly in
recent weeks but the Gallup poll still
shows him far in the lead, with 56 per
cent of the Republican voters favoring
him. This popularity is no doubt the re-
sult of his extraordinarily effective work
as a prosecutor. People not technically
equipped to pass judgment on his D. A.
record have taken to pooh-poohing it late-
ly. The fact remains that the Dewey rec-
ord in the most famous D.A.'s office in the
United States is the best that we've had
in forty years.

That, of course, doesn't necessarily mean
that Dewey is qualified to be President of
the United States. But he has other sources
of strength. He has a way with audiences.
He has presented the case against the phi-
losophy of economic stagnation with more
color, more vivid detail and at least as
much cogency as any of the other con-
tenders. He is not, as he has been charged
with being, an extreme isolationist. He is
more feared by the third-termers than
anyone else.

Yet the political signs indicate that
Dewey's strength may be greatest at the
outset of the balloting and that his fol-
lowing may disintegrate. The party lead-
ers have their fingers crossed, largely be-
cause of his tactlessness. And whether they
will be unerossed depends, now, almost en-
tirely upon the skill of his managers at the
Convention.

Taft: Emerson once said of the Earl of
Chatham: "There was something finer in
the man than anything which he said."
That something was character. Which is
by no means to imply that Taft's sin-
cerity, modesty, conscientiousness and
trustworthiness are all he has to offer.
Taft's speeches show more experience in
national government and more native wis-
dom than Dewey's. His views on foreign
policy look slightly more to American par-
ticipation in world affairs, although they
emphasize the profound importance of
considering American interests first. Ac-
cording to present indications, Taft and
Dewey will come to the test with about the
same number of votes. But Taft unques-
tionably grows on people. He may well be
stronger on the second and third ballots
than on the first.

NEWSWEEK JUNE 17, 1940

Willkie: If executive experience, a capac-
ity to understand the tremendous indus-
trial problems immediately ahead, and the
ability to think fast, speak well and fight
magnificently were the decisive factors,
Willkie would be nominated by the Re-
publican Convention. According to the
polls, Willkie's rise in national popularity
has been phenomenal. His nomination is
possible but not probable.

Landon: The candidate of 1936, with
Mr. Hoover, belongs in a separate cate-
gory. Either, in case of a long deadlock,
might be the nominee. They cannot, in
any event, be ignored among the pros-
pects. Landon's crushing defeat in 1936
obscured the fact that he has genuine
qualities of leadership—common sense, dig-
nified humility and a wealth of instinctive
understanding of human problems. He has
grown in the past four years—the test of a
man overwhelmed by a great defeat. He
has no rancor about that defeat, no over-
powering ambitions, and is genuinely de-
voted to the interests of his country and
his party.

Hoover: Time has placed the events of
his Administration in a kindlier light.
Hoover was, to no small degree, the vic-
tim of the depression. Seven years have
taught us that many of the policies he
sponsored in the years before his defeat
are fundamentally sound. He remains the
best-informed public figure in this coun-
try, an exceedingly able exponent of a
basic theory of economics, and one of the
few men who have been thinking beyond
politics.

From among these men the choice
is likely to be made. Largely because of
the temper of the country on international
affairs, Vandenberg, able though he is, is
not apt to be nominated. Bricker, James
and Joe Martin are scarcely more than out-
side possibilities at this moment. Who-
ever the candidate is, he will deserve
thoughtful attention. This country will not
let its ears be stopped up by those who
say it is unpatriotic even to consider
changing horses in midstream.

As the lessons the English and French
have learned at so much cost grow more
bitter, the emphasis on competence at
home increases. We are hearing more and
more loudly that a country in the midst
of critical national preparations should not
hesitate to get rid of political fumbling;
that the sooner it is done, the better for
everyone concerned.

Whether or not the group in power have
fumbled is an issue that must go to the
American people for a decision. The deci-
sion is theirs, just as the price for the mis-
take that may be involved in it will also
be theirs.
