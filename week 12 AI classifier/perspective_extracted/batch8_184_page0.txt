**Perspective**

**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

No abstract exhortation about the dangers of power could have a fraction of the persuasiveness of the concrete demonstration provided last week by the House committee headed by Howard W. Smith —the committee which is investigating the National Labor Relations Board.

The investigation committee has revealed that under an arrangement made last year, the RFC agreed to withhold loans from companies if a charge had been filed with the NLRB alleging unfair labor practices against that company. Chairman J. Warren Madden of the NLRB stated that he understood that the RFC had a similar arrangement with the Wage-Hour Administration. Mr. Jesse Jones, Federal Loan Administrator, admitted that loans had been withheld from companies under such circumstances.

In substance the NLRB-RFC agreement means that a company can be denied the use of money the RFC has agreed to lend even if a charge filed with the NLRB alleging unfair labor practices has not been substantiated; even if the Board has issued no complaint against the company but "will do so"; even if the company has not yet been given a hearing on the complaint. Such a denial of funds by the RFC might conceivably mean death to the company. But the RFC agreed to such denials to help the NLRB enforce the Labor Act.

Here’s bureaucratic power for you!

Let us look at this thing in all its implications. An administrative agency, the NLRB, is created by Congress to enforce a law of Congress. Congress gives that agency the power Congress deems proper and needful for the enforcement of the law. But the NLRB is not satisfied with that power. Without asking Congress for more power, it succeeds in getting more from another agency established for a wholly different purpose. By agreement with that other agency, the RFC, the NLRB succeeds in applying a double squeeze to a business enterprise. More, the chairman of the NLRB admits he has made attempts to get still other agencies to work similarly with the NLRB. The Procurement Division of the Treasury Department was asked to withhold government contracts from companies found by the NLRB to have violated the Labor Relations Act. But while the Comptroller General, according to Madden, held that the government had no such authority, there nevertheless are opened up the possibilities of a multiple squeeze within that half-lit area called administrative discre-


tion—the possibilities of a ganging up of discretionary bureaucratic forces.

There is apparently no limit to the pyramiding of such power. It is a partially irresponsible power. It is being used in ways hitherto unknown to the American public. It is the kind of abuse that has, to date, eluded the foresight of Congress. It may well be unreachable by the courts. And it is literally capable of strangling its victims.

It shows more vividly than reams of fancy generalizations what can be expected of a government swollen with power. It shows that power can be dangerous even in the hands of good men, for Jesse Jones of the RFC is a fair, honorable and efficient public servant. It shows that power over economic life grows by what it feeds upon. It shows that power is a malignant, spreading infection which, if not checked, will destroy private enterprise and personal liberty. And it shows just how practical were the intentions of the founders of our government to restrain personal power.

These men knew that the interposition of government in any private activity would often be necessary. But they also knew that it would never be more than a necessary evil. That is why they tried to restrict it, hedge it about with safeguards. That is why they devised the so-called system of checks and balances, dividing up the power of Federal government among three separate, independent branches. That is why they placed time limits upon executive power. That is why Jefferson, who saw the danger of personal power more clearly than anyone of his time, retired from office to strengthen the tradition of a two-term limit on the Presidency. For the Presidency is the head and heart of bureaucratic power. If we want to curb bureaucracy, we must curb the Presidency.

We now have a President who has built up a bureaucracy capable of such a use of power as the NLRB investigation reveals. The President has appointed a majority of the Supreme Court. He continues to enjoy the exercise of extraordinary powers granted him by Congress in time of an emergency that is apparently endless. Among them are the power to inflate the currency; the power to conclude trade agreements with other countries without reference to Congress, which includes the authority to raise or lower existing duties by 50 per cent; the discretionary powers involving farm benefits granted by the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act of 1936; and the power to fail to find that a state of war abroad actually is a state of war.


The existence of such powers, in turn, makes it possible for the President, by all the political realities, to exert an almost unprecedented influence on Congress.

There is no effective way to limit this power except by limiting his term of office. Let this be remembered as we talk about whether the President wants a third term. The issue is not whether he wants it: it is whether we want it. It is not for him to make that decision. The people of the country must make the decision for him.

They must make it not only despite, but, in part, because of the strange pronouncements of two of his Cabinet officers in recent days. Mr. Farley, for one, says that “talk” of “a regime to perpetuate itself” is all “moonshine.” He chides us for our fears, but he fails to chide those who cause those fears. That is because the fellow members of a bureaucracy must stand together. It is “disloyalty,” according to the bureaucrat’s code, to criticize publicly any of his fellow workers. It is apparently “loyalty” to tell us not to be afraid. But the thing that Mr. Farley calls “moonshine” is lightning. And it isn’t the kind of lightning that strikes Presidential candidates.

Mr. Ickes, also a Cabinet officer, provides the last and final link in the chain of circumstance that tends to close the avenue of liberty. We must not criticize our Executive, says he. “Anything you do at this time to shake the confidence of the great mass of the American people in either the President or the national government is a sin against free enterprise, individual liberty, political democracy and your own self-interest. No matter on what you may disagree with him, he is now a symbol of confidence whose loss of symbolic value would now make all agreements and disagreements utterly unimportant.”

This statement makes the picture very clear. First we elect a President who sets up a bureaucracy. Then the bureaucracy, by one means or another, begins to chisel away the economic rights of a group of citizens. Then, when members of this group raise their voices in protest, a chief bureaucrat, Mr. Ickes, tells them that to exercise their constitutional right to criticize the Executive or their government is “a sin against free enterprise, individual liberty, political democracy.”

Mr. Ickes forgets that the “sin” he describes is “sin” for which great and good men have given up their lives. It is the basis of American liberty.
