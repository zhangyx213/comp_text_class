**Do-It-Yourself Politics**

by Raymond Moley

HERE is part of a letter I have received from a young woman in a small city in Illinois:  "This is the first year I shall be able to vote. Consequently, this is the first time I've paid any attention to what is going on in politics. Both my husband and I are anxious to do something. But we don't know what to do to help the party of our choice."

This is typical of many letters and personal inquiries I have had, from New York to Oregon. Similar inquiries flood the national committees of both parties and the Nixon and Kennedy headquarters.

Here is what I would reply to such potential workers—men and women, young and old:

For the long pull I would advise you to join the party organization in your locality and work with it. They need millions like you.

But for the short run between now and Nov. 8 there are certain practical facts you should know.

This is the busy season for the regular party people. They are very active with the workers they have. There are also certain preliminaries to go through before you find yourself smoothly fitted into regular party work. There is, unfortunately, in many—not all—local party headquarters a definite professional clannishness which distrusts newcomers. There are also, unfortunately, many local party organizations that are badly organized and inefficient. For the short period of this campaign you may not feel the organization atmosphere congenial. Next year work with the organization.

**WORK THROUGH FRIENDS**

I suggest that you call a small meeting at your home and invite in a few of your friends who are sympathetic with your position in this election. Don't bother with people who are committed to the other side. It takes a long time to convert, less time to induce the right-minded to do something besides voting. At this and other meetings, don't spend much time discussing the Presidential candidates and issues. If you are with people who generally agree with you, they have accepted the candidate and what he stands for. The point is to influence as many votes as possible through personal contacts and hard work.

Suggest to the people at your first meeting that they have small meetings with their friends. Thus you will in a short while have a group, however small, that will get others to register and vote. It will be essential to find out all about registration. Also, to know how those who must be away on Election Day can get the forms necessary for casting absentee ballots. Then, with a group pledged to do some work before election, get from party headquarters literature, buttons, and posters for distribution.

**HELP LESSER CANDIDATES**

Be sure you don't neglect the candidates of your party for the State Legislature and Congress. Generally these people have headquarters. Have some of your co-workers go there and volunteer to help. There is always something to do there—answering telephones, distributing literature, and helping with mailings. These lesser candidates are very important. The legislatures of many states will be redistricting their states, and that will largely determine which party will control the House of Representatives for ten years.

Also, remember that every vote you get for the candidates for the lesser offices goes to the head of the ticket, too. Start at the bottom of the ticket and work up.

Money is necessary, and the more you can raise in small amounts means the more people with a real interest in the election. But any money-raising should be done with the knowledge and direction of the financial people in the regular organization.

Finally, you should follow up the people you can contact. Don't be a nuisance, but take whatever occasions present themselves to talk personally with voters. It is well established that voters are influenced much more by personal contacts than by the candidates' speeches or by what they read. The labor unions realize that, and it accounts for their remarkable success in politics.

Every vote counts. Your influence may reach only a dozen people or it may be more. But as Theodore Roosevelt said: "Do what you can, with what you have, where you are."
