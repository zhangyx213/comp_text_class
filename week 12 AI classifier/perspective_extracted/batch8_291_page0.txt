**Perspective**

**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

**Specifications, Please**

On the all-important questions of
the relations of government and business
and the extent to which it would modify
and overhaul our economic machinery, the
new La Follette party is vague. It seems
to propose a frank assertion of the govern-
ment's right to own and operate certain
kinds of business and, on the other hand, a
recognition that other kinds of business
are best left to private enterprise. But its
lack of clarity suggests that a progressive
can enlist in it only if he is willing to be
surrounded by the economic snake charm-
ers and sword swallowers who have de-
stroyed the progressive movements of the
past—including the late New Deal.

If the La Follettes have in mind a
dispensation in which there is government
ownership of certain important areas of
industrial enterprise, a limited collectivism
in others, and government regulation in
still others, they will provide a rational
opposition to those within both the Demo-
cratic and Republican parties who believe
that the solution of our ills will be at hand
when the United States has been trans-
formed into a nation of small proprietors.
And if, at the same time, they frankly
recognize that there is nothing liberal about
an emotional approach to those problems,
about a desire to bedevil business, they
will provide a rallying point for every
honest progressive in the country.

But an attempt to reconcile irreconcila-
bles, to obscure fundamental issues and
toss political baits right and left, will mere-
ly compound the philosophic and economic
confusion which Mr. Roosevelt has come to
represent.

Productive enterprise can live under a
measured collectivism. But it cannot live
with a government which, while professing
devotion to private enterprise, has—
through personal pique, hopelessly contra-
dictory policies and the belief that progres-
sive principles are synonymous with per-
sonal power—succeeded in making invest-
ors and producers so fearful of the future
that economic life is freezing in its tracks.
In any choice between the two, this must
be the paramount consideration. It remains
to be seen whether the La Follette program
will pose the issue comprehensively.

**Nothing Ventured**

To stir capital into taking business
risks once more is universally admitted to
be the need of the critical moment. That
money which Lammot du Pont the other
day called enterprise capital—equity capi-
tal, proprietors' capital, the risk-bearing
capital as distinguished from the lent-and-
borrowed capital which must be returned
sometime—that money is still scared, still
seeks safety above everything else. The
result is the extreme depression in all the
things venturesome capital usually buys—
the heavy goods of industry.

Government, on its part, offers such
scared capital an ever-increasing quantity
of its own securities, the funded national
deficits, and even competes in offering to
lend, by way of the RFC, the same kind
of money to the thinning number of gen-
uine enterprisers.

The remedies proposed for this drought
of enterprise capital are of two groups.
Businessmen want the restrictions imposed
by government upon profit making to be
lifted, or at least not to be increased. Gov-
ernment wants manufacturing enterprise to
venture back into price cutting, so far as
that can be done without wage cuts. The
Administration is unwilling to take the
political risks involved in modifying such
acts as the Wagner Act. Industry affirms
that it can scarcely do much price cutting
without wage cutting. Thus the stymie of
enterprise capital is fairly complete.

But can we be certain that, if all restric-
tions and inhibitions upon the free play of
old-fashioned risk capital were lifted, busi-
ness would spring overnight into activity
on a prosperity scale? The time seems to
have come for both business and govern-
ment to realize that the rewards of adven-
ture are not going to be what they used to
be. If the Administration really understood
this, it would do away with those regula-
tions which assume that speculative profits
will actually be larger in the future than
they ever were in the past. If the owners
of capital understood it, they would not
look for the returns they got in the twi-
light of the old era only a decade ago: they
would not even look so nearly unanimous-
ly for security in the places they are put-
ting their money today.

Americans continue to save, but they
invest their savings in places which offer a
small but certain yield—certain up to a
point, but a point which, there is reason
to suspect, is being passed. Not everybody
can find security in any direction, as work-
ers are discovering after trusting to union
agreements and seniority plans, as more
workers will discover in Social "Security"
if the government's deficits continue, and
as capital will discover if it clings too long
to the idea that, because one security can
be secure, all securities can be, after money
has ceased to take risks.

If there is any lesson the world is teach-
ing business today it is that the yield on
ventured capital is going to be small, but
that, if it is not ventured, the capital itself
will disappear. And if there is any lesson
the world is teaching the Administration
today it is that something positive is need-
ed to stimulate the adventure of capital.

Both government and capital must begin
to take some chances. Let Congress take
a few political risks and business will re-
spond by taking some more business risks,
both in the direction the Administration
wants it to go and in the direction it always
has gone—toward that revived expansion
on more modest hopes of profit which alone
can revive our production.


**Green-Eyed Economy**

The popularity of J. Edgar Hoover
throughout the country has long been the
cause of bureaucratic backbiting. For five
years the Treasury Department and its
own police force, the Secret Service, have
been muttering in their beards each time
Mr. Hoover’s successful operatives won
applause. Unfortunately, the Budget Bu-
reau is part of the Treasury. That is why
the following sequence of events is not in-
explicable.

Last year Mr. Hoover asked for $6,530,-
000 for his Bureau. Acting Director Bell
of the Budget Bureau allotted $5,925,000.
Congress raised this to $6,000,000. With
the coming of the second half of this fiscal
year, a number of emergency demands for
investigative work—the Harlan County
violence cases, the Levine kidnaping, the
Kansas City election-fraud cases, the ex-
tensive mail-fraud cases in California
and others—caused the Bureau to run
$173,000 into the red. No relief came from
the Acting Director of the Bureau, on
whose responsibility relief largely depend-
ed, and Mr. Hoover and his chief, the
Attorney General, had no recourse except
to cut the force. Five offices have been
closed in recent weeks, and half of the
field force—339 of his 678 agents—has
been put on mandatory leave. This has
placed the remaining men on duty in grave
danger.

When Franklin D. Roosevelt placed his
record before the people in a platform al-
most entirely of his own composition, he
justifiably placed at the very head of his
accomplishments the following: “We have
begun and shall continue the successful
drive to rid our land of kidnapers and
bandits.” There is irony in the denoue-
ment. Now, less than two years later, the
slogan seems to be: “We have begun but
we cannot continue the successful drive to
rid our land of kidnapers and bandits.
Billions for pump priming, but we just
can’t spare $173,000 for the G-men.” The
platform was correct in 1936 in praising
Mr. Hoover’s bureau. It has since gained
in efficiency. Its staff and equipment should
be expanded not contracted.
