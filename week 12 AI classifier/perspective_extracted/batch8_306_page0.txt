**Perspective**

**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

**Substitute for Chaos**

Mr. Roosevelt, like nature, abhors a vacuum. This is the chief reason why I enthusiastically hail the proposal that he take unto himself a small advisory council on economic subjects. Its presence would check the amiable and unfortunately somewhat disastrous process of advice getting which now exists. Nothing would go so far toward clarifying the President's own thinking as the substitution of orderly, systematic reports from such a group for the spasmodic, often dogmatic, usually conflicting counsel that now shapes his course.

Official advisers have been about as effective in assisting the President revive business as were Walt Disney's seven dwarfs in resuscitating Snow White. He has been getting advice on economic problems from young lawyers whose firsthand knowledge of business has been limited to running the college law review. Then again, he has been getting advice from dogmatists who want to make the world-that-is conform to a picture of a world-that-never-was. In between, he has been getting advice from the spokesmen of isolated pressure groups who are moved by no interest excepting their own. Peppering this has been political advice which knows neither law, economics nor, it would seem of late, common sense.

Out of this witches' brew has arisen a horrendous vapor which, despite the fact that it may be called a moral climate, is actually an atmosphere in which business enterprise can do little but curl up and die. There have been too many lawyers thinking about economics, too many economists thinking about law and too many politicians thinking about votes. As Santayana suggests: "The man with a hole in his shoe is not forthwith a cobbler: much less does a landsman become a pilot when he is seasick."

Yet the would-be pilots have been shrieking into the ears of the man at the helm. Some of them tell him not to worry about storm, since the ship will come through it in any event. Others try to pull him aside to ask whether he will help them to get a berth on some other ship, when they reach home. Still others demand that part of the crew, like Jonah, be thrown into the sea.

The news that there may be a constructive attempt to replace this babble of misinformation and self-interest with a few facts about the draught of the vessel, the position of the rocks and the velocity of the wind, is the most hopeful that we have had in a long time. And a group representative of all divisions of the national economy, even though some of its individual members may be shortsighted, is more likely to provide that kind of guidance than a series of contradictory counselors.

There have been three fairly definite suggestions as to the possible make-up of such a group. The first is that of Senator Bulkley, chairman of the Committee on Manufacturers of the United States Senate. For a year or two Senator Bulkley has been working on plans for a national council as a center of study, research and advice. He suggests that it be established by law of Congress and provide advice and information for both Congress and the Administration. Its members would be drawn from business, labor, agriculture, the physical and social sciences and other groups and appointed by the government and private representative groups in a nonpartisan fashion. Its advice would extend not only to business problems, but to problems of labor, agriculture, finance, law, engineering, medicine, sociology, economics and political science.


Senator Bulkley is careful to point out that such a council would be advisory only and would, therefore, not encroach on the powers of Congress and the President. He points out further that it would not be designed to increase government intervention in business but rather to enable the government to avoid increased intervention by helping, through the dissemination of information, to keep the economic mechanism of the country working more efficiently.

Another proposal which has been before the President for a long time is, in general, the product of the thinking of Dr. Tugwell. This contemplates the creation of a council of representative businessmen and economists, numbering about twenty. Such a council would consist of divisions interested, respectively, in the problems of production, consumption, domestic trade, international trade, prices, capital issues, natural resources, finance and the like. This council, too, would be entirely advisory. Its function would be to coordinate plans and to present, in perspective, the recommendations and complaints of diverse groups and interests.

A third suggestion has emerged from the meeting of the President with his Business Advisory Council. This idea does not definitize the problem even to the extent the others do. It simply looks toward the gathering of a small advisory group consisting of representatives, geographical and functional, of all elements which have a stake in legislative and administrative policy. There would be representatives of business, big and little, of labor, of finance, of distribution, of agriculture, of transportation, of credit, of investment and of consumptionâ€”all, presumably, serving on a voluntary basis.

The establishment of some such council, even on an emergency basis, at this time, would in no sense prevent the President from listening independently to the points of view of such men as have been at the White House in recent weeks. But the council itself might bring the advice of these men more completely and succinctly to him. Everyone who knows how government actually works knows the practical limitations of the casual conferences the President has been holding. Those who are given appointments confront a man already overburdened with work. They are obliged to describe their ideas sketchily, imperfectly, in the give and take of hurried conversation. These advisers, moreover, often go in groups, and while it is true that they may leave memoranda behind them, the fact is that there is no one in Washington to coordinate and interpret these memoranda. The President cannot do it: there simply are not enough hours in his day. No one official other than he could do it: no one who is not in a position to view the picture in its entirety is equipped to pass judgment on them. There remains only the possibility that a disinterested, unhurried, diverse group might see them in perspective.

To the theoretical objection that such a coordination of knowledge is a step toward regimentation, I have only one answer: rubbish! "What freedom can there be in ignorance? What autonomy in being driven this way and that by wishes without knowledge?" The democratic process does not demand confusion in counsel and chaos in policy.

Let us not be confused, either, by the suggestion that these proposals are part of a subtle effort to bring back the NRA. Everyone in the Administration knows what the essential weaknesses of the NRA were, and no one has described them better than General Johnson. There is no evidence of any desire in Washington to repeat the mistakes of that experiment.

The statement left with the President by the Business Advisory Council last week is an admirable presentation of the problems with which such a economic council might grapple. Its calm phrases suggest a basis for thought and action. What is lacking now is an agency that might study, in detail, the questions it raises.

Let us marry knowledge to power. Each has been walking alone too long.
