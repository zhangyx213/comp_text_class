**PERSPECTIVE**

**The Issue Isn't Personal**

*by Raymond Moley*

THE deplorable tragedy of Nov. 22
has precipitated a drastic change
in all campaign plans and projections
for 1964. Most important of these
changes is that the coming year's
campaign will be determined by
party issues and principles rather
than personalities.

The personality of John F. Ken-
nedy was so unusual that in the 1960
campaign and during his Presidency
he stood out sharply against his party
background. The earlier Presidents
he spoke of often and greatly ad-
mired were Jefferson, Andrew Jack-
son, Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow
Wilson, and Franklin D. Rooseveltâ€”
party leaders and builders. Theirs
were personal Presidencies.

Mr. Kennedy was unique in all the
environments in which he ever found
himself. He was a quiet reader in a
family of activists; the Harvard intel-
lectual among the practical operators
of Boston's Democracy. The measures
he sent to Congress bore his individ-
ual stamp. He gave old principles
new names with highly intellectual-
ized justifications. He was a very
young man among elderly party
leaders. The people he gathered
around him in the White House
were mostly without previous party
identification. His Cabinet members
were not people who had been
prominently identified with the Ad-
ministrations of FDR and Truman. It
was inevitable that the campaign of
1964 would be a matter of personal
rather than party prestige. The vote
would have been a referendum of
confidence in him and his program.

**LBJ, A PARTY MAN**

Lyndon B. Johnson has always
blended into his party background
like an iron kettle in a New England
fireplace. For 28 years he was in, for,
and of his party in Congress. He was
a child of Congress much as Winston
Churchill was, as he often said, a
child of the House of Commons.
When the Senate leadership was va-
cated, Mr. Johnson, a relative new-
comer in the Senate, was selected by
his colleagues because he was re-
garded as one of their very own. He
made his way in legislative matters
by compromise and exhortation and
by appeal to party solidarity. He was
never an innovator. Rather, he was a
creator of Democratic consensuses.
Despite occasional complaints by lib-
eral colleagues, he tried to bridge
the gap between the Eastlands and
the Humphreys. To mavericks such
as Wayne Morse he gave tolerance
rather than affection.

When he became Vice President,
something seemed to have gone out
of his life. He floated, like Kipling's
Tomlinson, in the great winds be-
tween the worlds of the Executive
and the Legislature. In that office
Jefferson was a most unhappy man. I
doubt that Johnson was a happy Vice
President. He did not seem so.

**THE GREAT TEST**

And now LBJ is the head of a
deeply divided party. There must be
seeming unity where there is no unity
in principle. He is faced with the task
of reconciling the irreconcilable. No
one is better suited to that task. For
the new President is the most skillful
prestidigitator of our time. His per-
sonality while at work suggests the
presence of hidden eggs and white
rabbits, with a few odd cards con-
cealed in the palm or coattail.

Mr. Johnson moved from the party
of John N. Garner and Joseph T.
Robinson in the early 1930s to that of
Harry Hopkins and Harold Ickes later
without a missed step. In Texas,
where the Democrats have been
split down the middle, he kept to the
happy center.

Now these talents meet their great
test. For the President is heir to poli-
cies he did little to create. While he
must promote those programs, he
must not alienate the Democrats who
oppose them. In the South there are
already indications that many Demo-
crats who had been drifting to the
Republican Party believe that, what-
ever laws may be passed, there is
safety in the knowledge that it is the
new Executive who will enforce
them. Hence, it will be more difficult
to win Democrats from nominal ad-
herence to their traditions.

The task before the Republican
Party is to expose the split in the
Democratic Party, to make clear that
LBJ is the prisoner of the liberals,
and to offer a clear choice between
two philosophies of government.
