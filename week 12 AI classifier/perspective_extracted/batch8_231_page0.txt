**Perspective**

**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

**Farley Feels His Way**

Jim Farley, public and private polls show, is running third in the choice of the rank and file for the Democratic Presidential nomination. It is known that he has a large number of political leaders throughout the states pledged to his support in 1940. It is known that he wants to be President. It is known that if Mr. Roosevelt were out of the running Farley might go into the convention with the largest single bloc of delegates. Finally, it is known that, if Mr. Roosevelt should try to get a third term, Jim could stop him if he chose. That Jim will not choose to stop him is simply assumed out of hand by most political commentators. For Jim is a Party Man. And when you've said that, you've said everything—or almost everything.

Jim, pink and smiling, in the past years has survived the most trying ordeals a Party Man ever went through.  To begin with, he has passed out more government jobs per man-hour of Postmaster-Generaling than any of his predecessors, Republican or Democratic. Those who believe that handing out plums is the way to popularity forget the cynical truism that every time you fill a job you make nine enemies and one ingrate. Dispensing patronage involves questions of veracity, judgments of relative merit, the remembrance of prior commitments and endless clashes with the other Cabinet heads through whom most appointments have to be made. After a few years of it, most political leaders are ready to give up the ghost, knowing that they've made so many people mad that they can't hope to get further politically. But Jim Farley's enemies are chiefly people he's never met. People who have dealt with him are almost without exception his friends.

For three years Jim's had to stand in the midst of the fire between the two wings of his party. Under the circumstances, most prudent men have retreated to one side or the other. Jim blandly holds his middle ground. Privately, he's frank to admit that his position isn't getting any safer, now that small fry in the Roosevelt administration have begun to take covert potshots at him. Publicly, he'd tell you that he never heard of the word "split." But more significant than either of these characteristic reactions is the fact that, for one political reason or another, he can still command support from both sides.

There's a third test poor Jim has had to pass. He's had to do time as rap taker for the President more often than any of his Cabinet colleagues. Yet he's done it so manfully, so uncomplainingly and so visibly that people are compelled to respect the loyalty that prompts him to gather in his ample bosom the arrows aimed at other targets. The political Desdemonas love him for the dangers he has passed, the wounds he's borne in silence. His loyalty is perhaps a more endearing trait, politically, than his absolute personal honesty, his unpretentiousness and his friendliness.

Throughout the years Jim has never attempted to pass judgment on the President's policies. He has quietly accepted them, leaving the job of policy making to the President and attending to "organization" matters himself. He disagreed with the purge program not because of any high-flown notions about the independence of Congress, but because it violated his sense of "organization." To him the Democratic party is a benign haven to which the majority of the American voters ought to repair on election day—not an Ellis Island for sorting out "undesirables." Who is a Party Man to say what shade of thought is undesirable, in any case? Jim is not finicky. His tolerance is boundless. He draws the line only at the point where he is asked to let a New Deal sympathizer, like the Progressive La Follette, run unopposed by a "regular" Democrat. But what Party Man wouldn't balk at that?

The purge program offended Farley, too, because of its sheer wastefulness. After all, it takes years to develop a successful Democratic senator. It costs much in jobs and contributions. To destroy him offhand, because of a few perverse votes, is to toss away this value. Jim was shocked by the President's wasteful and wanton destruction of Democrats.

Jim, for one, is not the man to strain at gnats. And if you classify as gnats such schemes as the corporate-surplus tax, the Court-packing bill and the reorganization bill, you get the picture. Jim made no disagreeable fusses about any of them. He accepted them with a sure instinct for party organization. "After they are all talked out," Jim said loyally at the height of the Supreme Court debate, "we will call the roll. You will find we have plenty of votes to put over the President's program."

Jim was completely sincere. He likes every man to have a fair hearing. He knows that there are at least two sides to every question. He doesn't take criticism as a personal affront. Friendship with him can remain unimpaired even when differences over political or economic questions obtrude themselves. And he never forgets that his business is getting the votes.

This is all to the good, from the Party Man's point of view. The political leaders throughout the country are not men who are going to judge Jim on the basis of whether he has or has not definite policies to take with him into the White House. To these leaders policies are like the frock coats and spats that you wear at the inauguration—something tailored to order by journeymen experts. They are not essential parts of the man himself, to be weighed seriously when he is chosen.

It may be assumed that Jim's privately expressed qualms about the third-term issue spring less from philosophic opposition to a third term than from the belief that a third term would raise the devil with the party. But that is of no particular importance. It is the existence of the qualms that is important. For they confront Jim with the most agonizing dilemma that ever a Party Man had to face. Jim is loyal to Roosevelt not only for personal reasons but because Roosevelt is the chief of the party. Hence the assumption that, if Roosevelt says the word, Jim will do all he can to nominate him for a third term. On the other hand, Jim wouldn't like to see the party go down to defeat in 1940, under Roosevelt or anyone else, and if his political information forces him to the conclusion that Roosevelt could not be reelected, it is by no means a certainty that he will immolate himself at the altar of one of the two conflicting loyalties.

Incidentally, Jim is not unaware of the fact that some of the very young men who swoon at the thought of Jim in the Presidency or Vice Presidency, and who would like nothing better than to see Roosevelt run again, are trying to cripple the Farley candidacy by loud affirmations that Jim's loyalty wouldn't permit him to deny Roosevelt anything. Jim has no intentions of letting his hand be forced by stories so obviously intended to embarrass him. Nor is he apt to let them hypnotize him.

You may be sure that Jim is moving cautiously. When the time comes, he will still be in a position to throw his strength behind either side of the party. It's safest not to jump to conclusions about where he will throw it. I don't believe he's decided that question for himself yet. He may follow the Pickwickian aphorism about joining the biggest crowd. His love for the party may overwhelm his love for Mr. Roosevelt. His personal ambition may find a perfect rationalization in the opposition to a third term. No one knows yet—least of all Jim.

The point to remember now is that potentially Farley's support is essential to the nomination of anyone on the Democratic ticket. And Jim isn't likely to trade off that advantage because of any New Dealer's advice about where his duty lies.
