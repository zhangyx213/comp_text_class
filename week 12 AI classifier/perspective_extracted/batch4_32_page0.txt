**It's Up to Two Texans**

by Raymond Moley

LONG-STANDING restraints upon impulsive legislative power will be subject to the most formidable attack in a generation when the new Congress meets. That Congress will be largely dominated by the New Liberalism—which is the name adopted by adherents of a philosophy which has no kinship with the liberalism of years past. And the forces which weighed so heavily in electing that Congress, including the political unions, are intent upon removing restraints in both houses.

The two restraints involved are the Senate rules governing freedom of debate, and the House rules which place upon the Rules Committee the grave and necessary responsibility to act as a sort of board of review of legislation coming out of the many committees of that body.

In the Senate, two alternative changes will be considered—both adding to the closure provisions which were adopted in the heated days just before the first world war. The more extreme proposed change will be the revival of the Douglas-Javits Senate Resolution 17, introduced in the 85th Congress. It would bring debate on a measure to a close by "majority vote of the senators duly chosen and sworn" the fifteenth day after a motion to end debate, signed by fifteen senators, has been presented to the Senate. Thereafter, no senator would be allowed to speak on the measure more than one hour.


**MODERATE PROPOSAL**

The less extreme measure to be considered would be the Johnson-Knowland S.R. 30, also introduced in the 85th Congress. This would limit debate after an affirmative vote of "two-thirds of the senators present and voting."

The Douglas-Javits version was sponsored by fifteen senators; the Johnson-Knowland compromise proposal, by 38.

Since either proposal would be vigorously filibustered under present rules, the chance of passage would depend largely upon the capacity of Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson to win enough votes to pass his compromise. And, as was shown in the 85th Congress, Senator Johnson is a very skillful parliamentarian, indeed.

In the House, a group of the so-called "Mustangs" are intent upon doing something about the House Rules Committee, of which the chairman is Judge Howard Smith of Virginia. This group would "pack" the committee with more Democrats who are on their side of the issues which will come before the House. Presumably, they are also for a return of the 21-day rule, which would compel a report on bills by the Rules Committee within 21 days. In the past, Congress there were eight Democrats and four Republicans on the committee. The "Mustangs" cite the greatly increased Democratic membership of the House as a reason for adding more members of their liking.


**HOUSE RULES ATTACKED**

The resentment of the liberals against the Rules Committee stems from the fact that in the 85th Congress a number of authorization bills were killed in the committee or were slowed down so that they died in the last days of the session. This check upon action, however, is the very purpose of the Rules Committee. Taxpayers were saved billions under the guidance of Chairman Smith.

In evaluating the situation, it should be noted that in the 85th Congress 13,875 bills were introduced in the House and referred to committees. Thousands died there. Others were reported out, and many were approved by the Rules Committee and passed. Unless the Rules Committee has some discretion, there is no use having it at all. The result would be utter confusion in so numerous a legislative body with a limited time for members to examine and vote intelligently on measures in such numbers. Carelessness and chaos would result.

No one knows this better than the veteran Speaker Rayburn. Upon him rests the responsibility for checking the "Mustangs." It is not likely that he will neglect this crisis in the House he has served so long.

In any event, the two Texans, the Speaker and the Senate Majority Leader, hold the key to moderation and sanity. My guess is that they will hold that key pretty firmly in the months to come.
