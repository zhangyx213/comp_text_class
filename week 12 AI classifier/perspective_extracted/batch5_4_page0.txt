**A Matter of Integrity**

by Raymond Moley

As William F. Knowland reaches the end of his thirteen years in the Senate, the comments of his colleagues will echo those expressed when he announced his retirement some months ago. His integrity is proclaimed by those who have served with him. Five of those years he has spent capably filling the shoes of the foremost senator of these times, Robert A. Taft.

But mendaciously, and also, as we shall see, with gross political ineptness, his enemies in his campaign for the governorship of California have leveled their attack at his integrity—the strongest spot in his armor. As the story is unfolded, calculated chicanery and smearing seemed to them the only course they could take. Since they were unable to argue principles, they chose to attack the man himself.

The following account is based upon unimpeachable sources in California and upon my own knowledge of that state’s politics after several years during which I have been a part-time resident of the state.

When Knowland approached the end of his second elective term, he was profoundly disturbed by what was happening in California. Despite Republican majorities for some statewide candidates, the Republican vote for candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives and for the State Legislature had been diminishing for several years. This was because the political money and manpower of certain unions had been beefing up the hitherto emaciated Democratic Party. This was masterminded by union bosses as far east as Detroit.

**DEAL IS CHARGED**

Meanwhile, Gov. Goodwin J. Knight, elected as a conservative Republican, threw his allegiance to the union bosses and espoused compulsory unionism. Hence, the Republican Party moved on its way to extinction. Knowland realized that with Knight in the governorship another four years, the two-party system would vanish there as it virtually has in Rhode Island and Michigan. Thus, in California, Knowland saw his inexorable duty. His bluntly stated reasons for running for governor were: “I do not intend to sit complacently by and allow California to become a satellite of Walter Reuther’s labor-political empire. There is a job to be done in California.” (He would now add Hoffa to Reuther, since the Teamsters’ boss has taken a hand in the California campaign.) Knowland did not spell this out, and so his enemies opened fire upon his motives.

With Knowland in the primary contest, under the cross-filing system, the union bosses realized that Knight had to be taken out of the race for governor, since he would have split their controlled vote with Edmund (Pat) Brown. And so they cast their lot with Brown, and Knight was eased into the nomination for senator with plenty of support from them. This is proved by the appearance of the joint Brown-Knight advertising campaign.

**THE ATTACK FAILS**

To cover their tracks, they spread the story that the elimination of Knight was the result of a “deal” with Knowland. The fact is that Knowland was disappointed when Knight withdrew as a candidate for governor, because he also knew that Knight would split the union vote.

More recently, another vicious attack has been made upon Knowland’s integrity. He was accused in the pro-Knight press and elsewhere of making another “deal” to drop his opposition to a union shop.

This charge—that Knowland would buy the bosses’ support at the expense of his pronounced convictions—was blown to atoms at the Republican convention on Aug. 2. Knowland met the issue head-on, in a vote against endorsing the union shop, and won—79 to 18. Thus, his enemies’ charges were exposed as false; the way is opened to a fighting campaign on the issues, and Knowland emerges as the undisputed head of the Republican Party in California. Most of all, his integrity is vindicated.

Finally, it exposes to the rank and file of union members—forgotten in the scheming of their bosses—how they have been deceived and exploited by their leaders, who have been less concerned with the economic advancement of their members than with the acquisition of their personal political power.
