**HHH, COMPLETE STATIST**

**BY RAYMOND MOLEY**

It was not without significance that among the hosannas through Europe which greeted Hubert H. Humphrey's nomination was the voice of Tage Erlander, Premier of Sweden. For the roots of the Minnesotan are firmly in the Northwest where Scandinavian immigrants brought patterns which have had a deep influence upon American political life. These fine people transplanted forms and practices of statism which prevailed in their homelands well before Marxism spread elsewhere in Europe. Some of these were cooperative buying and selling, public ownership, and state laws regulating railway, financial, and wholesale "monopolies." These were the policies of organized political movements such as the Nonpartisan League, the Farmer Labor Party, and, more recently, the National Farmers Union. Many political leaders imbued with these ideas reached high office. An economist who has been the idol of liberals for a generation was Thorstein Veblen, the embittered son of Scandinavian parents. (When the Rev. Thomas Clement Douglas was Premier of socialist Saskatchewan, he said that he had picked up most of his ideas in Minnesota.)

As Humphrey's articulate sponsorship of statist policies brought him distinction in the Senate, he formed alliances with liberal leaders from other parts of the nation—notably with Walter Reuther—who had drawn their inspiration from other semi-Marxist sources.

**A CLEAR CHOICE**

The result was that Humphrey sponsored countless measures which substantially gave meaning and form to American liberalism. For any real or fancied need he was ready with a proposal for a new program. There was nothing, it seemed, which could not be corrected or reformed by a Federal bureau and Federal money. Even old programs from the 1930s were revived or invigorated with new appropriations. Someone has said that Humphrey always had more solutions than there were problems. Even "culture" was to be created by a Federal agency.

In the Humphrey record there has been none of the deviation which has brought so many criticisms of JFK and LBJ for inconsistency. The voting scores compiled by the ADA, the AFL-CIO's COPE, and the Farmers Union show 100 per cent for the senator. Thus, his selection as a candidate by the President has gone far to create what Goldwater has demanded, a clear choice between the two parties. His selection has also made it possible for the President to take a course sharply distinct from the one he inherited from his predecessor. For Humphrey's statism is far more clear than was JFK's. The President has never been the creator of programs. Now it will be Humphrey who will manage production, while his partner will attend to selling the programs to Congress.

**SUBMERGED INDIVIDUALS**

In his recent book, "The Cause Is Mankind," Humphrey describes his amazing personal activity—fourteen working hours a day, 70 telephone calls, attendance at many committee meetings, and, what should be added, interminable speeches on the Senate floor and elsewhere. There has been no time for serious reflection in this bustling career. There is nothing about ultimate ends, no philosophy behind this proliferation of government services, subsidies, and controls.

The questions which Humphrey, the complete statist, raises are: If money is to be the medium of exchange, how can more and more be supported by fewer and fewer earners and taxpayers? Where are we going in this mad course? What place will there be for the individual in this collective society?

Humphrey would raspingly deny that the ultimate end is socialism. I am willing to concede the point to him, but the reality will be individuals submerged under a shepherd government. Federal activity must be aimed at collections of people, with the individual a statistic therein. The end would be a miscellaneous aggregate of adventitious props and benefits, all stemming from a vast central authority. A Great Society—to use LBJ's borrowed phrase—composed of items whittled and sandpapered to a dreary and mediocre uniformity by Federal law.
