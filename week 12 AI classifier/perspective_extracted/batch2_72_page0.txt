**PERSPECTIVE**

**AFTER OREGON—WHAT?**

**BY RAYMOND MOLEY**

This department has had nothing
to say about Presidential politics
since the NEWSWEEK issue of April
20. There has been nothing to say
beyond speculation in the context of
various primaries. These meant very
little except that various possibilities
for the GOP nomination were striving
to nominate someone other than
Goldwater, the leading contender.
This division is only superficially a
choice between several estimable individuals. It is a replay of an old contest in the Republican Party between Eastern leaders and interests and the Midwest and West and now, the South. This conflict goes back to the first nomination of William McKinley.
In past months, whoever offered a choice against Goldwater—Smith, Rockefeller, Lodge, even Stassen—received a considerable vote.
The "upset" in Oregon was in the main an upset of the experts who believed Lodge to be a sure winner.
Now perhaps those experts whose dispatches show President Johnson to be a sure winner in November will reconsider their superficial and quite sketchy prognostications.
The Lodge bubble did not explode in Oregon. Much of the gas escaped in the Illinois primary in mid-April when Lodge preferences were only 6 per cent of the total. And it was pretty flat after the Nebraska preference where Lodge had only 16 percent—a poor third.


**ROCKEFELLER MONEY**

Thus the popular call for Lodge softened as the center of interest moved away from the land of the Cabots, the Lowells, and the Lodges.
Most experts failed to note this.
The vigorous efforts by those who favored Nixon in Oregon during the final two weeks of the campaign there were not an effort to nominate the former Vice President. They were designed to take votes away from Lodge. The reasoning was that the Goldwater support was a hard core there as it is in other states and whatever strength could be channeled away from Lodge would end his quest for the nomination. This has been admitted since the primary by the Lodge people, who promptly allied themselves with Rockefeller to stop Goldwater in California.

But Rockefeller's desperate campaigning in Oregon and a large outlay of money had a part in the result. An experienced estimate of that outlay puts the figure at no less than $600,000. This went for four mailings which in other years cost about $150,000. There was a great deal of paid time on the air and many advertisements in Oregon newspapers; also, $10 a day for ordinary workers to sit behind desks. One observer has said since, that never again in Oregon will there be volunteer unpaid workers. Rockefeller has given the political labor market a new look. The money flowing in California will break all primary records.

**NIXON NEXT TARGET**

From now to the California balloting, the coalition against Goldwater will be the managers and supporters of the three Easterners—Rockefeller, Lodge, and Scranton.
If Rockefeller wins in California he is by no means certain of the nomination. The drive of money and influence will be directed at winning the support of wavering or uncommitted delegates already selected.
Then, if that fails, we may expect the anti-Goldwater coalition to concentrate its attention not for, but against, Nixon. For contrary to much of what is offered as current opinion, Nixon is closer to Goldwater than to any of the Eastern candidates.
Ideologically, these two men are not far apart. Both are dedicated to Republican success and have proved that in their tireless campaigning for party candidates over the years since 1952. In 1952, Nixon was selected as the Eisenhower running mate to "balance" the ticket. His record in the House and Senate before 1953 was conservative; he was a Westerner and he was a favorite among Republican leaders in the Midwest and West. Also, many of those around the President who wanted President Eisenhower to "dump" him from the ticket in 1956 are now anti-Goldwater. Only a strong party demand from other parts of the country in that year made him the Vice Presidential nominee again.
That is how the political scene looks from here on the eve of the California primary.
