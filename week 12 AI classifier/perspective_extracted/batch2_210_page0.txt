**Perspective**

**In 1965, $137 Billion**

by Raymond Moley

WHEN Harry Flood Byrd makes one of his infrequent statements in the Senate, he is heard with attention and respect. Logic and meticulously organized facts reach far beyond—to the House and the homes of the nation. For here is a senator in the luminous tradition of the past. He speaks by the book of experience—experience since 1933 in the Senate and, before that, seventeen years in the government of Virginia. Meager family means precluded a college education. He went to work at 15 and made a success in competitive business. Presidents, Treasury Secretaries, and Budget Directors have come and gone and have seen Byrd’s estimates match their own.

On Sept. 13 he presented with elaborate documentation a grim warning to us all. His estimate is that in 1965 the Federal outlay will be $137 billion—$106 billion in the Federal budget which we all see, and $31 billion from trust funds which few of us understand.

Those trust funds are not like the money and securities you set aside for the family and children. They are from money exacted from you outside normal taxes. They are spent for current government expenses. Then, except for the highway funds, Uncle Sam’s IOU’s are put in the trust funds. When the IOU’s are spent, they must be replaced by new exactions or by new IOU’s. The outlays must go on indefinitely. But you pay for them. In the 1965 estimate, $23 billion in trust-fund outlays will be for OASI and disability and unemployment, $3.5 billion for Federal highway construction, $700 million for FNMA, and $4 billion for “other purposes.”

**INEVITABLE INFLATION**

Only $9.1 billion of the total increase from 1961 is for the military and foreign aid and international affairs. The big jump of $23.4 billion is for domestic-civilian purposes. How is this great sum to be raised?

Senator Byrd offered his judgment, as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, that Federal tax rates cannot be increased substantially to meet the mounting burden of spending. “The point of diminishing returns has already been reached in some areas.” Dollars must come from borrowing through deficit financing. This, as everyone knows, means exactions from the public in inflation. This has two effects—the cutting of everyone’s true income, as real an exaction as a higher tax; it also has the effect of a capital levy on all savings.

Two reassurances are offered by the Administration for its profligate spending. One is that the government should no longer reckon from year to year, but over what is called a business cycle. Byrd shows that, however years are grouped, this has never worked out. No one knows what should be called the number of years in a business cycle. But assuming that it is from three to ten years, the promised balancing has appeared only once in the past twelve years.

**THE GNP FICTION**

The other reassurance, repeated over and over in the 1960 campaign, is that by the stimulus of great Federal spending the gross national product will rise so fast that present tax rates will bring the necessary dollars. But the GNP is a colossal fiction. Senator Ervin brought this out in supplementing Byrd’s statement. He used the illustration of a Mr. A who owned a business which produced actual goods worth $30,000. Mr. A then employed Mr. B and gave him $20,000 of the $30,000 to run the business. Then Mr. B employed Mr. C to help and paid him $10,000. All these sums go into the government’s GNP. Thus, $60,000 of GNP is only $30,000 in real production. At that rate, a GNP would represent twice actual production. But any increase in GNP possible by 1965 would not provide the necessary revenue.

Byrd placed in the record a specific list of actions taken, recommendations made, and promises by the Administration in its first six months. They number 175. These are of infinite variety. Benefits for us all, and for the birds of the air and the beasts of the field, domestic and wild.

Without war, if this continues, the Marxian dream will be fulfilled. For no economy can stand that sort of strain without destroying itself through expropriation and an international run on the dollar.
