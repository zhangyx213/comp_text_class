**How the Parties Differ—II**

**by Raymond Moley**

LAST week I summarized an analysis of the voting records of members of the two houses in the 1961 and 1962 sessions of the 87th Congress which has been made by the Stricker Research Associates, a highly reliable agency serving a number of private clients. On the basis of votes in 268 Senate and 98 House roll calls, it listed members in an ideological spectrum running from conservative to liberal, in the current sense and use of those words.

The advantage of this analysis over similar ratings by the AFL-CIO’s COPE, the ADA, and the ACA is in the larger number and variety of roll calls counted.

I arranged the names of members, as shown in the Stricker study, in three groups in each house—conservative, middle, and liberal. In the Senate grouping there were 5 Democrats and 32 Republicans who were conservative, 9 Democrats and 6 Republicans in the middle, and 51 Democrats and 2 Republicans liberal.

In the House there were 9 Democrats and 138 Republicans conservative, 45 Democrats and 35 Republicans middle, and 216 Democrats and 1 Republican liberal.

In the large majority of cases, the roll calls considered were on amendments to bills. Such votes are more significant because members, after amendments have been disposed of, are mostly inclined to take or reject “half a loaf.”

**DEMOCRATIC DEVIATIONS**

The issues selected involved the enlargement of Federal authority and activities, fiscal policy, and the intervention of government in the free economy. Omitted were roll calls on foreign policy except where the foregoing domestic issues were involved. Also omitted were votes on civil rights and procedural matters. These do not clearly reflect ideological differences in domestic affairs. Also omitted were roll calls in which there was substantial unanimity.

To assure myself of the nature of the Stricker judgments, I checked each issue and considered it in accordance with what my own vote would have been, had I been a member. My variation from the Stricker evaluation would not be more than 15 per cent, which would place my position somewhere near Allott and Harry Byrd in the Senate.

Deviations from the party majority on the issues counted, which excluded civil rights, were far greater among Democrats. In the Senate 13 Democrats were on the conservative side of the middle line; 2 Republicans were on the liberal side.

Since only a fanatic would demand exact conformity on party alignments, the Stricker study assigns percentages to the members. Individual judgments vary. Also, local and regional interests are to be considered. For members are supposed to be representatives of their constituents as well as custodians of the national interest.

**A REAL DIVISION**

Thus, such senators as Lausche and Carlson fell into the 70 to 90 per cent range of conservatism; Goldwater, Mundt, Curtis, and Hickenlooper above 90 per cent, and McClellan and Holland in the 60 to 70 per cent group. In the middle group were such members as Russell, Aiken, and Russell Long. Among liberals, such respected names as Mansfield and Pastore were 27 and 25 per cent respectively.

The “most conservative” ten in the Senate were, in alphabetical order, Bennett, Cotton, Curtis, Dirksen, Goldwater, Hickenlooper, Hruska, Miller, Mundt, and J.J. Williams. The “most liberal” senators were Bartlett, Burdick, Carroll, Gore, Kefauver, McNamara, Morse, Moss, and Neuberger.

In the House, the ten “most conservative,” in alphabetical order and who are still in Congress, were Alger, Ashbrook, Becker, Bruce, Collier, Devine, Hoffman, McCulloch, and Schadeberg. The ten “most liberal” were Celler, Gilbert, Hansen, Healey, Karsten, McCormack, Moss, Multer, Powell, and Frank Thompson.

It is interesting to note that among the large states’ members Ohio’s were most conservative and New York’s most liberal.

To repeat the conclusion I stated last week: the long-awaited reality of a two-party system has come into being. There is a difference between the two parties, deep and meaningful.
