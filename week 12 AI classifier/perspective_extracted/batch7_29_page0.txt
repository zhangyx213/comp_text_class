**A South Atlantic Pact**

by RAYMOND MOLEY

For a long, long time, people doubting the practicability of an immediate One World have pointed to the more immediate and possible avenue to world peace through regional organizations. This approach was outlined on this page in August 1941. It was recognized that there might be some sort of world league, which would for a long time be nothing but a debating society and which later, when things settled down, might act with some authority. Churchill in the middle of the war suggested the regional idea.

Official America, however, intent on a pell-mell settlement of all things at once, drove ahead with the United Nations and, once more, we deposited all or nearly all our eggs in one basket, with our big ally, the Soviet, holding one of the handles thereof. As we now know, that handle has been used for purposes of yanking, twisting, and generally endangering the precious load of eggs. About all that the Charter of the U.N. did about regional compacts was to authorize their creation. After some years of debate, punctuated by vetoes, at Lake Success, it is becoming evident that the United Nations, even when it exercises firmness, does so only by fragments of itself. And, nicely examined, these fragments are mostly groups of nations with more immediate concern in the issue involved.

The first very important recognition and adoption of the regional idea was the creation of the North Atlantic Pact, not just a good-will convention but a real alliance at arms. Now our government, with John Foster Dulles acting as promoter, is moving toward a Far Eastern pact or alliance.

I cannot see why a next step should not be a South Atlantic-Mediterranean pact or alliance. If, as is hoped, the arming of Western Europe deters Soviet aggression in that area, there remains the danger of Soviet penetration by its traditional pathway to the south and southwestâ€”through the Middle East and/or Turkey toward the Mediterranean and Africa. Africa and the Middle East provide the food of life and industry in Europe. And, as exponents of European defense point out, Africa is essential to us, too. The vital members of a South Atlantic alliance should be not only Greece, Turkey, Spain, and South Africa, but the nations of Latin America. There are mountainous defenses north of the Mediterranean. There are people there whose willingness to fight is unquestioned. South Africa has a considerable potential. And Latin America, with vast manpower, has a vital stake in the protection of Africa and the South Atlantic.

It is only right to expect Latin America to make a large contribution in land troops, ready to be moved to the front line of its own defense in the Mediterranean region. Perhaps our military leaders hesitate to mention this potential power because to mobilize it would not be easy. But the United States alone cannot furnish all the young men necessary to defend the world. We must have help from the southern part of the Western Hemisphere, as well as from Europe and Eastern Asia.

While we are in this business of defense, let us see that our right flank is mobilized. A South Atlantic pact is the answer to that.


**Lewis H. Brown**

The death of this immensely able citizen at the untimely age of 57 marks the loss to his country of a service far beyond mere sponsorship of noncontroversial public movements. His greatest service, as I saw it over the years, was the plain, outspoken and courageous defense of economic liberty and his equally forceful attack upon current trends toward socialism through a political regime dedicated to expensive handouts, inflation, and tax expropriation. He organized movements among businessmen that did more than deplore these things. Under Lew Brown's leadership, they fought them.

Those timid citizens who fear that forthright speech and action might "hurt their business" should look at Johns-Manville. Brown's public activity never injured that company. And it did a lot for American freedom.
