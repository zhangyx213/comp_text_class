**Perspective**

**Good Citizenship in Syracuse**

by Raymond Moley

REGARDLESS of who is nominated on
the Republican and Democratic
tickets this year, an imperative obliga-
tion rests on every citizen who wants
a change in Federal policies, a halt
to the senseless trend toward super-
statism, a change in our disastrous
foreign policy, and a new moral cli-
mate in Washington. I believe that a
large majority of the eligible voters of
this country want such a
change. But they will not
get it unless a lot of them,
regardless of party loyalty
or independence of party,
do something about it.

The average citizen can
do what he failed miserably
to do in 1948 and what he
has been doing with less
and less efficiency for at
least three-quarters of a
century. He can help get out the vote.

There are many and slightly vary-
ing estimates of the percentage of
eligible voters who have cast their
ballots in several recent elections. But
it is fairly clear that since 1880 the
percentage of the eligibles who have
voted has steadily declined. This is a
serious symptom of the failing health
of our democratic process. This week
I want to present a concrete example
of the constructive effort of one man
in one American city and county to
stop this dangerous political decline.

Clell Forsythe is an automobile
dealer in Syracuse, N.Y. He has done
all right in his business, but he has
had the admirable conviction that his
life could not be counted a success
unless he contributes some effort to
the preservation of that spirit of politi-
cal and economic liberty that has
made his business possible.

Let us note here that as an auto-
mobile dealer he has the talents and
capacity to do something for better
government that few, if any, other
lines of business afford. For an auto-
mobile dealer, either personally or
through his salesmen, knows some-
thing about practically every person
in his territory. He has business re-
lations with many of them. He must
service his customers' cars, tractors,
and trucks. He must keep their good
will in anticipation of their next pur-
chase. He understands credit and the
other factors that exist in a free
economy. He is also thoroughly ex-
perienced in a fiercely competitive
business. He is, in short, Mr. American
Individual Enterprise himself.

Clell Forsythe has been giving at-
tention to good citizenship for a good
many years. He has served in his
municipal and state government and
in national politics in one way or an-
other. More important, he has been a
leader in groups of small businessmen
and automobile dealers.

Now he is reaching the
stage of action in coopera-
tion with other automobile
dealers in Syracuse to get
out a thumping vote next
November. But to vote,
people have to register.
Hence, the Syracuse Auto-
mobile Dealers Association
is driving at both objectives.

In all such movements
there are two parts to the attack: first,
a campaign of education—printed ma-
terial, speeches, and conversation.
Then there is the personal solicitation.
For the American voter must be
reached at his home, and he must be
followed up to see that he actually
deposits his vote in the box.

The literature for this Syracuse
movement has already presented
an array of statistical evidence con-
cerning the gross neglect of duty by
voters. One example is all that can be
presented here. A check was made on
the voting in 1950 of members, both
men and women, of the five outstand-
ing social and golf clubs of Syracuse
and Onondaga County. The average
voting percentages of the clubs was
56.4 for the men and 52 for the
women. This is a shameful record for
those people who should set an ex-
ample of good citizenship and who
have so much to lose by present
trends. For in that 1950 election there
were being elected a governor, a U.S.
senator, and a congressman—the very
people who determine the character
of our government, the spending of
our money, and the preservation of
our liberty. These people should not
only vote themselves, but they should
be out getting other people to vote.

They will not be playing golf on Nov. 4
next if this new movement can pre-
vent it. If 10,000,000 more voters can
be turned out this year, the course of
American history can be changed.
