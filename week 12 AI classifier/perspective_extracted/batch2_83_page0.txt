**PERSPECTIVE**

**RFK's Power Play**

*by Raymond Moley*

THE robust ambition of Robert F.
Kennedy to be the Democratic
Vice Presidential nominee, the po-
litical assets which are claimed for
him, and President Johnson's distaste
for his Attorney General are political
considerations of the utmost impor-
tance in these early months of 1964.

The shocking event of Nov. 22
projected the Vice Presidency into
an importance never seen before.
Thirty-one individuals have been
elected President. Eight have died
in office. Thus, the chance of a Vice
President to succeed to the Presi-
dency is a significant 25.8 per cent.
Three of the eight Vice Presidents
who have succeeded to the Presi-
dency have been subsequently
elected. That, too, has significance.

In addition to these statistical ele-
ments which make the Vice Presi-
dency important, there is in this in-
stance the severe heart attack which
Mr. Johnson suffered nine years ago.
Even commentators most favorable to
the new President mention this quite
freely. Hitherto, it has been regarded
as dirty pool to mention in print any
impairment in a candidate's health.
Witness the campaign of 1944, when
every politician spoke freely of
Roosevelt's physical decline but no
writer to my knowledge dared to
mention it in his comments.

**STRATEGIC PATRONAGE**

Among those scribes who enjoyed
preferred access to the Administra-
tion in the Kennedy years there is
plenty of talk about Robert Ken-
nedy's political "availability." Fore-
most among the alleged advantages is
his possession of the Kennedy name.
One such writer stresses the Attorney
General's love of power. Those who
have supped at the head table find
little nourishment at snack bars. The
Attorney General wields immense
power because he is the boss of in-
numerable Federal attorneys all over
the nation. He dictated the appoint-
ments of most of these strategically
placed individuals. Moreover, during
three years RFK served as the chief
Federal patronage dispenser. His
beneficiaries are everywhere. And
any Attorney General is the custodian
of more "secret" information about
more public and private individuals

than anyone else in the government.
But another commonly discussed
"advantage" is RFK's Catholic reli-
gion. It is suggested that if Mr.
Johnson should pass over the late
President's brother and select, say,
Sen. Hubert Humphrey, he would
alienate great numbers of the Catho-
lics who supported JFK in 1960.
Thus, it is said, the Johnson ticket
would perhaps be fatally weakened
in the large industrial Northern states.

**AN INJURIOUS ARGUMENT**

All these elements, they say, con-
stitute a political "imperative" behind
the choice of a ticket-mate by Presi-
dent Johnson. I say "political" impera-
tive because few if any of those who
are supporting the RFK nomination
bother to present a case based upon
the personal qualifications of a man
who might reach the White House.
The Catholic argument deserves
very serious comment. I cannot believe
that thoughtful and responsible Cath-
olics, including so many thousands of
fine individuals in the priesthood,
contemplate with anything but deep
resentment the use of the so-called
Catholic vote as a pawn in a political
power play. Those, including who-
ever it was who compiled the "study"
which appeared in 1956 in support
of John Kennedy for Vice President,
who regard the votes of Catholics as
political assets are casting an insult
upon the patriotism and pride of
millions of Catholics and the great
institution to which they give alle-
giance. Most of them, I am sure,
believe that to introduce religion into
politics is to ignite bitter animosities.
This is a subject which should be
pondered by Mr. Johnson as he ap-
proaches the decision about a run-
ning mate. There can be no doubt
about his personal preference. In
1960 when he was a candidate for
the Presidential nomination and while
he was Vice President he suffered
too much from Robert Kennedy's con-
temptuous attitude toward him to
accept him happily as his closest col-
league upon whom he would place
confidence and affection. To permit
a choice to be forced upon him by
such considerations as I have out-
lined would be an injury to his gov-
ernment and the nation.
