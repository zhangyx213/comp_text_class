**PERSPECTIVE**

**FEDERAL SCHOOL AID-I**

**BY RAYMOND MOLEY**

One of the many expressions in
Shakespeare which were inspired
by his incredible contemporary, Chris-
topher Marlowe, is "a great reckoning
in a little room." Marlowe wrote it
"infinite riches in a little room." No
doubt Shakespeare as he lifted the
gem recalled that Marlowe was killed
in a quarrel over a tavernkeeper's
reckoning of the costs of a long
afternoon of eating and drinking.

I recalled this classical touch when
I tried to analyze the President's
message on education and the bill
which was explained for him to the
House subcommittee by Secretary
Anthony Celebrezze.

Politics demanded that the bill's
alleged benefits be spread to 90 per
cent of all school districts and that
Catholic schools get at least a pittance. Fiscal reality required that the
$1,250,000,000 for the first year
would allow no district or school to
get very much. But its provisions
make it clear that wherever the benefits would flow, the heavy hand of a
Federal bureaucracy would follow.

The bill was very cleverly designed
to offer a small bait to Catholics, who
have opposed Federal school aid in
previous years. There is also an inducement to state governments,
which are struggling with the mounting cost of education. Educational
theorists are won by money for their
frills and fads. Integrationists are
bought off by the bill's emphasis on
help for the schools in which they
are interested. And state school administrators' offices would be beefed
up with funds for their bureaucracy.
Of course, the National Education
Association is made happy by any
sort of Federal money for schools.

**HELP FOR THE 'IMPACTED'**

The bill seeks, further, to dampen
the opposition of those Americans
who have always opposed Federal
aid on principle. For it is made to
seem that states and local districts
will retain a measure of their traditional self-determination.

But when the House committee,
quite fearful of what the Supreme
Court will rule, attaches amendments,
the Catholics will sip the dregs of
bitter disappointment.

Title I of the bill is really an extension of the system of aid to "impacted
areas" now in operation, which provides Federal help to school districts
into which great Federal defense
industries and many workers and
their families have moved. But the
bill is also designed to recognize districts "impacted" by poverty.

Title I would authorize $1 billion
in the first year to be paid through
the U.S. Office of Education to states
which, under federally approved
plans, would make grants to school
districts with state-approved programs
for children of low-income families.
Presumably everything would be approved-school construction, teachers'
salaries, nursery schools, adult education, and "counseling." Parochial-
school children would benefit through
"dual enrollment," a scheme to spend
part time in their own schools and
part time in a public school.

**ILLUSORY CATHOLIC AID**

Title II would provide Federal
funds to the states for library resources and textbooks. In those states
which prohibit distribution of public
funds for private use, the Federal
government would help directly, or
the parochial-school children would
borrow books from a public agency.

Title III would set up model
public-private educational centers for
school administrators to view, admire,
and emulate.

Title IV would permit the U.S.
Office of Education to give grants to
colleges and other institutions to do
research, surveys, and demonstrations
in educational science. The most serious of these supported activities is
"curriculum development." The Commissioner of Education commented:
"Our goal is a national network of
federally supported but state- and
university-operated research centers
... They must have the facility to
explore any avenue of improvement
which can contribute to their mission."

Title V would provide money to
help state departments of education
to enlarge their operations.

Not only should Catholics remind
themselves of the danger of Federal
control of education generally, but
they should contemplate how easily
this bill can be amended in Congress
or disallowed by the courts. In the
end, Mr. Johnson's gesture may prove
to be an illusion.
