**The Era of Planning**

by Raymond Moley

IN THE first of a planned four volumes
on "The Age of Roosevelt," Arthur
Schlesinger Jr. has undertaken a risky
job. He is a professor of history and a
scholar. He is also a controversial po-
litical figure dedicated to a program
of reform best expressed in the tenets
of the ADA. Therefore, to undertake
a history of these times he must ob-
serve the ethics of accurate scholar-
ship while not stultifying his position
on current political issues.

Since I lived through and partici-
pated in many of the decisive events
recounted in his book, I have been
asked for an evaluation. Despite my
utter disagreement with Schlesinger
on current issues, I am constrained to
say that he has written an informative
account of the vastly complicated cur-
rents of economic and political reform,
from T.R. to the inauguration of
F.D.R., with a notable respect for the
facts. No readable history is com-
pletely objective, and this is highly
readable. Macauley wrote Whiggish
history, and Bancroft highly colored
history. We must accept some prej-
udice for the value of being inter-
ested and entertained.

The Schlesinger book begins with
T.R.'s revolt against big business and
irresponsible wealth. He saw the Fed-
eral government's intervention as a
means of reform. Then it introduces
the Wilson years as an extension of
that revolt. I am not as confident as is
Schlesinger that there was an ideolog-
ical line of succession there, for Wilson
until the first world war was opposed
to Federal centralization.

**RATHENAU'S INFLUENCE**

But with that war there was intro-
duced to America a concept which
was to become the implementation of
Federal power. That was Wilson's
War Industries Board. Schlesinger
shrewdly notes the relationship be-
tween this agency, manned by busi-
nessmen, and the faith in planning
which is still the major premise of
ADA liberalism. He should have
added, however, that the War Indus-
tries Board borrowed a great deal
from the German concept which ap-
peared in 1914 in Walter Rathenau's
pamphlet, "Germany's Raw Materials
Management," which was destined to
rank with "Das Kapital" as a book that
changed the world. For Lenin ac-
knowledged that it gave him a plan
when power fell into his hands, and
the British Socialists ever since have
made planning their basic policy.

Schlesinger describes in fascinating
detail the zest with which planning
was seized upon by American leaders
of thought. John Dewey was im-
pressed by "the social possibilities of
war" in that it exalted the authority
and planning of government. Charles
Beard had what Schlesinger calls "a
rhapsodic vision of 'the imperative
necessity of planning." Even Herbert
Hoover, whom Schlesinger quite prop-
erly distinguishes from the traditional
Republicans with whom he was asso-
ciated in the Harding-Coolidge days,
was somewhat of a planner.


**F.D.R.'S INFINITE VARIETY**

As the tide of fate began to move
F.D.R. to the front and later nom-
inated and elected him, planning took
its place in his strangely diversified
program of New Dealism. Schlesinger
is right in giving great importance to
Rex Tugwell, a sincere and dedicated
planner. He also notes the kinship, un-
noted at the time, between Tugwell's
ideas and Hugh Johnson's NRA. The
baffling inconsistencies of F.D.R.'s
political notions are implicit in
Schlesinger's narrative.

It was in the midst of this congeries
of ideas and idealists that fate placed
me in the role, as Schlesinger puts it,
of "ringmaster of the experts." In this
job of reconciling the irreconcilable,
he says that I was "judicious and
sensible." I was willing to believe in a
measure of planning and regulation in
agriculture, but for the rest I was, as
Schlesinger says, "essentially con-
servative." Later, a good many, in-
cluding this writer, left the fold.

This was due to the conviction,
which grew with close association with
those charged with the power of gov-
ernment from the President down,
that while planning is a grand idea, it
assumes a wisdom and skill which
mere humans can never attain. The
safety of the individual is attained
only when economic decisions are the
product of an infinite number of in-
dividual judgments, and the power of
government is kept close to the people
through decentralization.
