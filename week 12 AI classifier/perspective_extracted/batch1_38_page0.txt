**PERSPECTIVE**

**A TENUOUS FRANCHISE**

**BY RAYMOND MOLEY**

In discussing the death of the Herald Tribune, one of my NEWS-WEEK colleagues—a wise and experienced publisher—said that a daily newspaper or a magazine enjoys only a “tenuous franchise.” This seems to be something that the newspaper unions fail to recognize, perhaps because it is incalculable in dollars and subjective in its nature.

The calculable losses in the two long stoppages in New York—in 1962-63 and 1966—are obvious enough. There are the losses to those who earn their living in those newspapers—the editorial, circulation, advertising and production people. In the case of the Herald Tribune employees, these losses are now absolute and final. There are the losses to those on the periphery—the paper manufacturers, the dealers and the businesses whose advertising must be limited. There are the losses in revenue to the governments concerned, and losses to the union treasuries.

But behind these is a still greater loss. It cannot be calculated because it is rooted in the habits of readers. Human beings foolishly believe that right reason guides their conduct and directs their decisions. But habit and custom play a far greater role in life than rational choice.

**CONSUMER HABITS**

In politics our vote is only slightly influenced by rational decisions on the virtues of candidates or the credibility of their promises. The belief that our choices are rational is itself a habit. And, more often than not, when we try to vote our personal interests we fail to perceive where our interests lie. Habit is the unseen master which shares all our decisions.

Those who advertise and sell a new product are always confronted by the problem of breaking the habitual choices of consumers. Millions are spent in inducing people “to switch” to this or that. Inducements are made in price or presents or packaging to create a new consumer habit.

Habit largely governs our choice of a newspaper and our preference for certain features in that publication. Many years ago Herbert Bayard Swope, master of the old New York World, told me that the popularity and permanence of a feature de-


pended upon regularity of time and place. This made for success in getting readers. It meant that a column should always appear on the same days and on the same page of the newspaper. This prompted Swope to inaugurate the op-ed—or the display of features opposite the editorial page—which is easily found.

That prompted me to ask for and obtain from the editor this last page in the book for this article every week. Initially it was easy to find, and after a while those who liked it found it easy to discover.

**SELF-DEFEATING UNIONISM**

Ask yourself what guides you in your choice of a newspaper. And what prompts you to buy a newspaper at all? You purchase the newspaper and read it because you have “always” done it.

But when the habit of reading a newspaper at a regular, stated time is broken by the suspension of that newspaper, you fill the gap some other way. That is why my friend used the expression “tenuous franchise.” A strike against a bus line hits at a necessity which outlives the time of suspension. Or an elevator men’s strike or an airline strike. The demand survives.

But with other news media available, the newspaper gap may be filled and readers are lost permanently.

The unions, by forcing these suspensions, have made it apparent to thousands that they can survive without their favorite newspaper or without any newspaper at all. Thus they have undermined their own base of support. They have broken into the house of habit and have terminated their reason for existence.

Habits are more notable in the conduct of older people. And since the Herald Tribune was for many, many years the breakfast companion of many thousands well along in life, nature has diminished their number. And so, among other factors, these suspensions hit the Herald Tribune harder than other newspapers. It is the first to fold. Others may follow.

Finally, whatever reduces competition cuts into demand. Only when the unions come to realize their partnership in a common interest will this suicidal trend be stopped.
