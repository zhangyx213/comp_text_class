**Perspective**

**Talking Like a Bear**

It begins to look as if the Democratic party is selecting a new emblem.  The Democratic donkey is to give way to the bear.

From the debacle of the Administration's program in Congress there have emerged crystalline issues for the campaign in 1940. The avalanche of defeat that began with the denial of President Roosevelt's request for the repeal of the arms embargo was devastating. It was so devastating, in fact, that it seems to have jolted from the leader of the party statements he may well wish he hadn't made.

Not only in arguing for the defeated measures but in regretting their loss, Mr. Roosevelt made predictions that only foreign and domestic disaster will satisfy.  The President selected the familiar economic barometer—the condition of business—to express his regrets. Business, he announced, will be poorer because of the action of Congress. Businessmen will hesitate to make commitments not only because of the failure of his arms-embargo repeal, and its effect upon the international situation, but because of the failure of the spend-lend program.

These are clear forecasts. Mr. Roosevelt used none of the fire-escape phrases usually employed by statistical analysts. So forthright are his predictions that people who have been supposing all along that a good business year in 1940 would help elect a Democratic Administration must reconsider their opinion.

This is going to put some interesting problems before Democratic strategists. Not long since, it was Charles Michelson's habit to clip for the use of orators all manner of headlines from financial sections of newspapers indicating good business, extra dividends, large profits and the like. He will now have to search for evidence of business losses, passed dividends and bankruptcies. But once he has collected the evidences of disaster, what can he do with them? It is one thing to use them against a party in power and another to try to use them as the justification for a party in power.

If Mr. Roosevelt runs, he can hardly run save as the bear candidate, as the forecaster who was right, and who, someone will be sure to say, has had what no business forecaster ever had before, not even Jeremiah—the power to make his predictions come true. It is possible that the public, in such a case, would be willing to vote for him as a forecaster, but not as a President.

The prime issue brought out by the collapse of the Lending Bill is this: is the national government to be given power to control the investment of the savings of the people? There is also, as my colleague, Mr. Robey, suggests this week (see page 38), the issue of whether the debt limit should be circumvented by the indirection of spend-lend technique. The power to control the investment of the savings of the people is, of course, the essence of state socialism. Congress has decided that the Administration should not have this power, not any more, at least, or not yet. The whittling of the bill in the first place, and its final rejection, with the Housing Bill, places the whole matter before the country. I doubt that most voters will hear it fully reasoned out. Instead, the issue, as always in such cases, is likely to be simply this—who's to have the credit for recovery in 1940 or the blame for the lack of it?

This offers businessmen a real opportunity that should result in genuinely improved confidence. They may well permit their risk takings to follow their political hopes, and any good look at the political horizon should encourage them to step out now in starting new enterprises and expanding old ones. If they do not, then their feelings may be very low indeed by Christmas of 1940.

My own belief is that Congress has sensed the feeling of the country better than the Administration. Congress has more than a thousand ears—1,064, counting the V.P.'s. The President has ears, too, but then, like all the rest of us, he has only two.

**New Quarrels for Old**

Perhaps there still are people who believe that the purpose of machinery for collective bargaining is to reduce or eliminate strikes. The assumption that it will lessen them is written into the preamble of the act that sets up the National Labor Relations Board. But if there are those who continue to think that neat formulas suffice to do away with strikes—and disorderly ones, at that—they must have been cruelly shaken by events in the automobile industry.

That no magic exists in getting employer and labor leader into the conference room has been demonstrated once again. Blessed are the feet of them that bargain, but this does not prevent them from kicking one another under the table. Obviously, collective bargaining is only a channeling of grievances. If the atmosphere is unfavorable to peace, there will be no peace.

The strikes in the automobile industry followed hard upon the split in the United Automobile Workers. Homer Martin, upon whom were previously focused the loyalties of many thousands, was denounced as a wrecker. To freeze him out it was thought essential to bring on strikes in several body and parts shops in Detroit and Cleveland. In behalf of General Motors employes, it was found necessary, strategically, to demand a supplementary agreement, one which would sufficiently certify to the C.I.O. dominance of its union employees and set up a craft interest—in this case the toolmakers—within the industrial union. By this tactical maneuver, some of the workmen grew understandably bewildered, not to say irritated. Whereupon the National Labor Relations Board, perhaps recognizing the peril to the institution of collective bargaining, began to vote the employees of a number of companies in the industry by their plant units, thus to see to which labor congregation they really adhered.

What reason have we to suppose that this experience of the automobile workers will be regarded as unusual from this time on? They have their contracts, achieved after collective bargaining. And now the peace is shattered by factional struggles between their leaders. Is there any prospect of their being able to select their leaders more wisely from here on? This is the second or third overturn of labor leadership in the one industry. May not the new leaders have to be "purged" when their time runs out—on the average, apparently, of every two years?

The way in which the Labor Board is taking up the plebiscites in the automobile factories suggests that Washington may slowly assume the regulation of labor affairs. Perhaps, in future, even the threat of factional disputes or jurisdictional troubles may cause the Board to offer to unions those benefits of Washington regulation which groups like the railroads, the banks and the securities dealers now enjoy. At any rate, the Lewis brothers, who are setting out to organize the building workmen (presumably the non-whisky drinking, non-poker playing, non-evil building workmen), seem to be recognizing the tendency toward concentration in Washington. Strikes must have the approval of headquarters.

But if labor finds itself being "coordinated" by Washington, its leaders politically tied in at the top, one important reason will be that we believed the machinery of bargaining would settle all labor problems and, relying upon it, fostered the emotions that broke it down.
