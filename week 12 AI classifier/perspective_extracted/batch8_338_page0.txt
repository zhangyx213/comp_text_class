**TODAY IN AMERICA**
**By Raymond Moley**

**Hail and Farewell**

DURING the past few months I've made it my business to travel some 12,000 miles through the country and to talk with many different sorts of people. That's an old and pretty crude way of finding out what people are thinking about. There's no scientific accuracy about the conclusions that result from such a jaunt.

But as it happens, my own size-up of the things people are worrying over coincides with the findings of a recent survey of a number of NEWS-WEEK readers. Our readers say they believe the following, in the order listed, are the greatest problems before the country today: (1) the relations existing among organized labor, industrial management and the government; (2) the status of the Federal budget; (3) unemployment and relief; (4) taxation; (5) the Supreme Court and the Constitution.

The order of this listing is worth noting. It is curiously suggestive of the first chill of disenchantment with Administration policy. It suggests something of the uneasiness and concern I found everywhere this summerâ€”even among those who took Mr. Roosevelt without reservations of any kind nine months ago. And finally, it suggests the basis on which the public is going to judge the President and Congress, as the whistle blows on the first quarter.

THE great wave of labor trouble that marked the first six months of 1937 found the Administration and Congress singularly unprepared. The public, which had been exhorted to believe that the Wagner Act would lessen the number of labor disputes, soon learned otherwise. The sit-down strike spread through the country, while the Administration resisted all suggestions that it condemn the device. Congressional leaders, incensed at the violation of property rights they considered inherent in the sit-down, attempted to take the issue out of the hands of the President and to condemn the sit-down themselves. But this effort failed, ending in an expression of mild reproof for both employers and the union.

Nothing was done during this session of Congress to expand the Wagner Act to cover both unions and employers. Administration forces in Congress consistently defeated all efforts, such as those of Senator Vandenberg, to amend the Wagner Act in order to make it less one-sided. Both Congress and the Administration failed to fix the limitations which the public, through its government, has an undoubted right to impose upon the parties to industrial warfare. The whole question is just as vague now as it was when this Congress began.

The failure of Congress to pass the Black-Connery Wages and Hours Bill was unfortunate rather than tragic. The intersectional fight had so loaded the bill with exemptions and exceptions that it would have been a feeble thing in any case. But now the President has the ammunition for a political drive to pass a much stronger bill.

IN spite of a few mild words about economy, the President made no real effort to curb spending, and faint rebellious rumbles in Congress on this subject had no effect. With business humming and profits large, government revenues for this fiscal year will be close to seven billions of dollars, the greatest sum ever collected in any year. Yet the deficit will be over $800,000,000. This is assuming that the Treasury estimates of income for the remainder of the year are not too high, an assumption which is exceedingly questionable. Thus Congress leaves the financial status of the nation in a wholly unsatisfactory situation. Now, at the precise moment when we should be reducing the national debt, we are still spending more than we are taking in.

FOR a while there was tall talk in Congress about cleaning up the relief mess. There were demands for the formulation of a permanent and definite policy, the reduction of relief expenditures, the earmarking of appropriations. But all that went by the board. Under Administration pressure, Congress appropriated the amount sought for relief without important restrictions. So Congress and the Administration moved into what was substantially the sixth year of Federal relief without the formulation of a policy, without even a determination of the size and character of the problem. Not until the tail end of the session, did the President finally consent to a rather inadequate taking of stock. The public is entitled to know that only stopgap relief legislation has come out of this Congress.

THIS Congress did nothing constructive about taxes. Reform of the tax structure is long overdue. The Treasury now announces that it will submit proposals for a general overhauling when Congress reconvenes, hoping to achieve reforms that will permit speedy and accurate determination of tax liability, prompt disposition of litigation, more equitable distribution of the tax burden, further changes to plug loopholes, and possible taxation of income from community property.

This comes late; the job might better have been done at this session. At the next, Congress will have its eye on approaching elections, and the chances for thoroughgoing tax reforms will be measurably smaller.

The hue and cry over tax loopholes accomplished little. In my opinion, it was raised principally for the purpose of making political capital, and to provide an excuse for the shocking inaccuracy of the Treasury estimates of income. The bill to plug tax loopholes was prepared hurriedly and was dictated by the necessity of saving face after the President's and Treasury's attack on tax evaders. It was understood by only a tiny minority of Congressmen; and, while it undertook to plug some loopholes, it is far from being a reasoning, understandable effort to improve our tax system.

IT is clear that, after four years of talk about planning and preparedness, the Administration, with reference to the major problems of relief, agriculture, labor and reorganization of both the judiciary and administration, simply wasn't ready. It forgot the first and foremost principle of planned, intelligent government, which is the coordination of the efforts of all those who are responsible for governing the country.

The President's public statements indicate that it is his belief that he alone should initiate proposals and that Congress should then find the means of carrying out his ideas. This is wrong in theory and impossible in practice. The Constitution contemplates a wholly different division of responsibility. Congress should plan with the advice and assistance of the Executive: the Executive should carry out the plans of Congress.

Congress' record, in terms of positive legislation, leaves much to be desired. But the most hopeful aspect of the present political picture is that, after years of indecision, Congress has rediscovered its true function in the Federal system. By vindicating the principle of an independent judiciary, Congress did much to vindicate the principle of an independent legislature. Parliamentary government has not failed. It has been reborn.
