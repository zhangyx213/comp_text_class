**More Regulation Ahead**

**by Raymond Moley**

LOS ANGELES—The foremost questions from businessmen here and in San Francisco concern the attitude of President-elect Kennedy’s Administration toward free enterprise. All wonder about the pattern of action.

The personnel of the next Cabinet offers no real clue. The department heads and the subordinates selected constitute a vaguely congruous whole made of incongruous parts. The men named for the top jobs of State, Defense, and the Treasury are men somewhat experienced respectively in foreign affairs, manufacturing, and investment banking. The rest are generally gestures to political groups which helped produce votes, and rewards for political service.

But there is a pattern which can be understood from an examination of the various reform concepts encompassed in the earlier New and Fair Deals of the Roosevelt-Truman times. During those twenty years there were in the government “liberals” of four distinct types. At first there were people who favored overall national economic planning. Then there were some who wanted government to get directly into business competition, especially in the electric-power industry. There were those of the “money-magic” ilk who believed in making everybody rich by swelling the volume of money. Finally, there were those who believed in more and more drastic legal regulation of all business. Felix Frankfurter, heir to the Brandeis tradition, was the major advocate of that sect and was the most active recruiter of talent.

**KENNEDY’S INTENTIONS**

The four schools were generally in conflict with one another. But the fact that the people recruited by Frankfurter were mostly young means that many are still around, and they are the ones who seem to meet most of the Kennedy favor.

Foremost among the regulators is James M. Landis, who was drafted to help write the early securities and securities exchange acts. He served on the SEC and after that on other commissions.

With the growth in power and number of such commissions, there were serious warnings. Some called this “administrative despotism.” Such agencies were nominally independent, but the power of the President was extensive. Collectively, their power is greater than that of the heads of the great departments, and their freedom from court review is considerable.

The selection of Landis to plan for the reorganization of these commissions is a plain sign of the Kennedy intentions. With authority to reorganize and regroup these agencies, and with Landis to regulate the regulators, the Presidential power would greatly increase. Centralized power would be the order of the day. The pattern is further emphasized by the appointment of brother Robert as Attorney General, since the Justice Department in many instances collaborates in the enforcement of the decrees of commissions. Thus there emerges a sort of government by lawyers headed by a layman with vast power of appointment.

**NET OF CONTROL**

Consider the scope of the power of these commissions: The NLRB over industrial relations; various boards over the air waves and aviation; the Interstate Commerce Commission over railroads and other ground transportation; the Federal Power Commission with great authority over the production and distribution of electric power; the Atomic Energy Commission with the key to the omnipotent atom; and other Federal commissions affecting trade and tariffs.

It is this vast net of control—more important than spending plans, or Federal aid for this or that, or farm legislation—that should concern the world of individual enterprise. Private ownership would remain, but it would be encompassed in a frame of regulation. And Presidential authority would swell even more than it did under President Roosevelt. FDR sought vast power of reorganization but he was frustrated by the House of Representatives.

Congress in 1961 may well note once more that reorganization is in the air. And business should prepare for more paper work, more trips to the seat of power in Washington, and less freedom.
