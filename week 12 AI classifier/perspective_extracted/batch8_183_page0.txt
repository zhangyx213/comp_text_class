**The Glenn Frank Report**

It seems to be the order of the day
for smart alecks of all stripes to sneer at
the report of the Republican Program
Committee. Headed by Glenn Frank, this
committee has worked for two years on a
general report for the consideration of the
public and the Republican Resolutions
Committee next June. It has produced an
impressive document, persuasive in many
respects, clear and definite far beyond most
party statements. Administration Democrats call it reactionary, faultfinding, smugly optimistic. One can see Charley Michelson thumbing the Thesaurus for synonyms.
The charges, of course, are absurd. If the Frank report represents Republican opinion, then the Republican party has whizzed forward through eons of philosophic time since 1932. If the report is mere faultfinding, then how explain such pointed sentences as this: "The people do not press the state to take in hand problems that are already solved or visibly on their way to solution"? If the report is overoptimistic because it rejects the "conception of a limited and lessening outlook for American enterprise," then so, in truth, are most American citizens. At heart we have always been optimistic in this sense. At heart we have always believed that with daring and imagination we could enlarge our economic frontiers to a point we could not foresee.
It is those who want us to stand pat on the past seven and a half years that are the real reactionaries. They argue that our economy is suffering from hardening of the arteries. The most they are willing to concede is that "there's life in the old gal yet." The Frank report insists that the gal isn't old. It reminds us of some of the jobs that lie before a young and growing economy. We need decent houses—hundreds of thousands of them. We need to replace obsolete plants. We need to exploit new inventions, new methods in production and distribution that will bring all American citizens more and better food, more and better clothing, better transportation and all of the scores of goods and services that go to make a higher standard of living.
This is the core of the Frank report. The program, as a party program, shows remarkable courage when it deals with many less cosmic issues. Taxes may not be reduced for a while, and if, in order to balance the budget, tax increases are necessary, they should fall upon the middle brackets. Collective bargaining is a basic right which should be protected by Federal law. The importance of Federal relief to the unemployed under present conditions cannot be denied, but it must be regarded as temporary, and not as the permanent governmental function it seems to have become under the New Deal. There is no harking back to old Republican tariff methods, but a modified endorsement of reciprocal agreements.
So it goes with a surprising number of items. On the agricultural issue alone are the shortcomings of the Frank program serious. It is true that both parties are sharply divided in their views on this subject, and that both are surrounded by powerful farm organizations which are also divided. Yet, as *The Kansas City Times* points out, in chiding the Frank Committee for its failure to come to grips with the basic farm problem, what agriculture really needs is a program that will make subsidies unnecessary. This neither the Frank program nor the New Deal has provided.
In the main, the Frank program shows as much thought, care and political realism as the program the Roosevelt Democrats offered in 1932. If the Republicans actually follow this line and if they emerge with a candidate who looks and talks as if he could be believed, they will offer a tempting choice to the voters next November.


**The Wagner Mediation Bill**

A certain amount of mental suffering and disillusionment must have been the lot of Senator Robert F. Wagner in recent weeks. These, at any rate, have been the experience of every other person who had a degree of confidence in the National Labor Relations Board when it was set up by the Wagner-Connery Act nearly five years ago. The House committee's disclosures of domineering and reckless procedures on the part of the Board's personnel have led to general wonderment about what will happen to the Act or the Board or both. That the present membership of the Board will be drastically changed seems all but certain. That the Act will be amended in any material way soon is less likely.
Senator Wagner now gives a clue to his feelings in his introduction of a bill to create a United States Mediation Board. He proposes to set up another independent board, one likewise of three members, whose purpose it would be to help employers and unions reach agreements after the bargaining process has been established. It would presumably do for general industry approximately what the National Mediation Board now does for the railroad industry. The new board would take up where the NLRB leaves off. It would assume those functions of mediation that the NLRB has apparently undertaken in a few instances.
The new Wagner Bill is a confession that collective bargaining is not enough. As everybody outside the Administration has realized for a long time, strikes are as likely to occur among the organized as the unorganized. In its early years a board designed to mediate in labor disputes might accomplish much good. It could take on strikes like those in the coal industry, which always become political issues, and those in automobiles and steel, which are very likely to become political issues.
The Senator is careful to delimit the proposed board's powers and to imply there can be no jurisdictional disputes between it and the old Board. Yet one can see how the very presence of a mediation board would prevent the further development of the present board. The NLRB would go on hearing the complaints of the unorganized. But once they obtained their initial agreements, their affairs would come within the province of the United States Mediation Board. Unless, of course, memberships revolted against their unions and demanded new elections. The old Board might then become even more of a nuisance to the established unions. The old Board would retain most of the grief of new organization and intra-union dispute, and the new one would carry on the evolution of collective bargaining in industry.
The passage of the new Wagner Bill might well be a recognition of the temporary nature of the NLRB. As time went on its functions could be absorbed easily. The new board, says the Senator, is not to have the power to compel the "waiting periods" which the railway board enforces in labor disputes in its field. Nor could it exercise compulsory arbitration. We may be sure, though, that as the new board gathered practice and prestige and stepped successfully into this or that resounding controversy—and no labor leader would amount to much who could not carry a difficult dispute up to the United States board—it would accumulate these semicoercive powers. Such a board would be another step along the road of general Federal supervision, in which labor is bound to be regulated as much as other enterprise.
