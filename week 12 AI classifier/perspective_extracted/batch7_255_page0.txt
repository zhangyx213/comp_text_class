**Perspective**

**Nebraska and Kansas**

by RAYMOND MOLEY

KANSAS CITY—Only farm distress
could shake the Republican party in
Nebraska and Kansas, and this year
prosperity is bursting out at every
seam. In the past few years, Nebraska
has begun to rival Vermont as a Republican stronghold. Two years ago,
her four congressmen were elected by
70 per cent of the vote. All four will
probably go back to the next Congress.
So will Sen. Hugh Butler.
And Val Peterson will be
the new Republican governor.
Predictions are easy in
Nebraska this year.

Something needs to be
said, however, to correct a
mistaken idea about Nebraska, widely held in the
East after the June primary.
In that primary, Dwight
Griswold, able and popular
three-time governor of the
state, attempted to gain the seat of
Senator Butler. He accused Butler of
isolationism. Harold Stassen came
down to help Griswold. Butler won.
But a firsthand examination of the facts
does not sustain the view that isolationism won. Griswold would have lost
in any event—Stassen or no Stassen.
The young man from Minnesota made
a good impression in Nebraska. He
was well received, and his views on
foreign affairs were not unpopular.

But Nebraska has two political
traditions—one very strange, the other
fairly common among Americans. The
first is that no governor shall be elected
senator. Eight have tried and lost. This
doesn’t make sense, but it is a fact.
The other is that, if a man has served
one term in office and has done all
right, he ought to get another term.
Nebraska people could find little to
discredit Butler’s term. He voted for
the United Nations, but against the
British loan. They refused to defeat
him on the issue of the British loan.
The people of Nebraska do not seem
to have doubts about the United Nations. Lincoln tried to get the UN to
come out there and offered much more
hospitality than did the Connecticut
brethren.

The scars of the primary are healed.
Griswold is supporting Butler. Senator
Wherry is saying that the Republican
party needs Griswold in national affairs, and politicians are booking
Wherry for the Republican Presidential nomination in 1948.
Nothing has ordinarily shaken the Republicanism of Nebraska, except an
agricultural depression. But when the
corn is as high as an elephant’s eye,
not only in the field but in the market
quotations, there will be no rendezvous
with Democrats. And that’s how it is
in 1946.

Kansas in 1944 turned in a Republican landslide. The governor, a
senator and six congressmen were
elected by 60 to 70 per cent
of the vote. No senator is
running this year. Frank
Carlson, now a congressman, is the Republican candidate for governor. There
isn’t much question about
five of the six Congressional
seats. In the district which
includes Kansas City, Democrats think they have a
chance. There the sitting
member was defeated in the
primary, and the Democratic candidate is making a spirited campaign.
But wiseheads think he is wasting his
time.

When other issues fail, Kansas always has prohibition, and that will be
the theme in the campaign for governor. Harry Woodring, former governor and for a time Secretary of War,
is the Democratic candidate, and he
has come out for the repeal of the
66-year-old prohibition amendment in
the state constitution. Republicans say
that this stand has simply placed a
headstone over a stillborn candidacy.
But Woodring and his party have a
hunch that time, a new generation,
the war and public recognition of
widespread hypocrisy have withered
the ancient ban. The Hutchinson
News-Herald recently had Dr. Gallup
take a poll, and sentiment seemed
evenly divided on repeal. But even if
Woodring should win the election, the
way to repeal would be long and
arduous. Two-thirds of the legislature
must vote to submit a repeal amendment, and it would not reach the voters for two years. Woodring is no New
Dealer. He might be called an Al
Smith Democrat. There is no mention
of President Truman in the Democratic
state platform.

Kansas has occasionally done the
unexpected in politics, but no miracles
are looked for this year. Why, asked
one of the wisest people I met out
here, should Kansas take a conservative Democrat, when it can have a nice,
luscious, conservative Republican?
