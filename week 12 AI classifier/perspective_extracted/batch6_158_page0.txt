Sidelights on a Statesman
by Raymond Moley

I KNOW of no better way to add to
the many overdue encomiums that
a grateful and somewhat repentant
nation is paying its foremost senior
statesman than, in the manner of a
congressman, to rise to a point of per-
sonal privilege. I would like to recount
three episodes which have added to
my admiration of Herbert Hoover.
Shortly after the election of 1932,
President Hoover invited
his successful rival to the
White House to discuss
the unpaid debts of vari-
ous European nations. Mr.
Roosevelt asked me to brief
him on the subject and to
accompany him to the con-
ference. The briefing con-
sisted of a collection of
typed cards which, held in
the ample palm of the
Roosevelt hand, provided the ammu-
nition for a series of questions ad-
dressed to Mr. Hoover.

It is not a compliment to the quality
of my prepared questions that Mr.
Hoover after a few minutes confined
his remarks to me. Perhaps this was
in part because there was no love be-
tween the two recent candidates. Mr.
Hoover himself in his "Memoirs" says
that he thought he might thus edu-
cate me. At any rate, he did exactly
that. For I sat enchanted by his
wealth of detailed knowledge on the
complex history of the debts and the
cogent manner in which he explained
it. It was a mark of his immense in-
dustry and his self-dependence that
never once did he find it necessary to
fall back upon his Secretary of the
Treasury, the competent Ogden Mills
who was also present.

Three or four years later I met Mr.
Hoover again on a transcontinental
train and once more profited from his
amazing knowledge during a long
conversation at dinner. The next
morning I preceded him to the diner,
and the steward, whose gossipy chat-
ter exceeded his food in quantity if
not in quality, told me an uncompli-
mentary story about Mr. Roosevelt
that I had heard many times before. I
listened without interest or comment.

Later, when Mr. Hoover entered
and sat down, the insufferable stew-
ard approached and said: "Would Mr.
Hoover like to hear that story about
President Roosevelt?" My faculty of
speech vanished. Mr. Hoover, never
removing his eyes from the bacon and
eggs before him, said without a smile:
"I don't like stories about Presidents."
Years have not diminished for me the
savor of that bit of Hooverian humor
nor my admiration for the principle
behind it. For it carried with it his
profound respect for the institutions of
his country, regardless of who may
hold the reins of power.

In 1939 I published a
book which told of my as-
sociation with national poli-
tics in the early '30s. It
contained some comments
critical of Mr. Roosevelt and
also of Mr. Hoover. More-
over, it contained some facts
about a certain diplomat,
now gone to his reward, and
a lawyer still among us.

After the book was published, these
people provided political gossip col-
umns with a strange story that Mr.
Hoover, incensed at my criticism, had
sent word to Mr. Roosevelt that they
should join in an attack upon me. I
paid no attention to the gossip. Later,
when the yarn was seriously pub-
lished in Life, a mutual friend called
me and said that Mr. Hoover was
infuriated at the story, and it was
suggested that I call on him.

I did so, and Mr. Hoover denounced
the story and emphasized that he had
had no communication with Mr.
Roosevelt of any kind. He went on to
say that he did not intend to permit
my enemies to smear me through the
use of his name. He therefore caused
a letter of denial to be written by
Larry Richie, which was published.

HE OWED me nothing except re-
sentment for the small part I had
played in the election of Mr.
Roosevelt and for my own published
criticisms of some of the Hoover pol-
icies as President. His action was in
the pattern of a great man in whom
power, place, frustration, and the ca-
price of an electorate had in no way
impaired the lineaments of character.
A score of luminous qualities can be
attributed to Mr. Hoover. My anec-
dotes illustrate only four: Profound
knowledge acquired by prodigious
toil, humor rare in a statesman, respect
for our institutions, and magnanimity
unparalleled in public life.
