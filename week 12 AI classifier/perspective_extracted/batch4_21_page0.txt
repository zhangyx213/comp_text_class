**Perspective**

Registered U.S. Patent Office

**Available and Controlled**

by Raymond Moley

WHEN the President and Prime
Minister Macmillan meet to con-
sider joint policy in Germany, there is
an item of difference with Britain that
needs serious attention. This concerns
our merchant shipping, critically es-
sential in case of hostilities. To sup-
port Britain and other Western
European countries, we shall have to
transport oil in great quantities. Eu-
rope is protected by an umbrella of
American airpower, and airpower de-
mands oil. Whatever the means of
carrying supplies to troops and allies,
including beleaguered Berlin, first
there must be transport of oil by sea.
All military operations outside the
cataclysm of a 24-hour, push-button
showdown-by air, land, or sea-de-
pend on the transport of oil. The only
exception is our atomic submarines.
Aggression cannot be met without
fuel, and transport of fuel means tank-
ers. They must be available to and
controlled by the United States. And
they must be fast and efficient.
Our military requirements demand
tanker tonnage in great amounts,
larger than in any emergency the na-
tion has yet encountered. There will
be no time to tumble into construc-
tion after shooting starts.

**U.S. RESOURCES**

Now let us look at our tanker re-
sources. Under the U.S. flag there are
about 6 million deadweight tons of
tank ships. But more than 70 per cent
of these were built during World War
II. To enter a war with obsolete ton-
nage would be ridiculous. Under
American control, however, and avail-
able to us are tankers registered in
Panama and Liberia. Nearly half the
16 million tons now under those flags
and 10 million tons under construction
are owned by overseas subsidiaries of
American companies. This modern
fleet is essential to any movement of
our military services, as well as to
our domestic economy.
The law now prohibits Federal sub-
sidies for such ships under U.S. flag.
To move the tankers and other bulk
carriers now in foreign registry under
the cover of Federal subsidy would
be prohibitive. There are violent ob-
jections to the Liberian, Panamanian,
and Honduran registry of American-
controlled vessels, not only by our
maritime unions but by British and
Norwegian shipping interests. If these
ships were to be forced under Euro-
pean flags, they would be wholly
unavailable to us except under con-
ditions set by those nations. We are
in agreement with our allies regard-
ing NATO, but we cannot afford to
relinquish our independence in such
decisions as we have already faced in
Asia. Without control of our ships, we
could make no move.

**THE REAL PROBLEM**

In January a conference of the U.N.
Intergovernmental Maritime Consult-
ative Organization was held in Lon-
don. The United States sought to
gain seats for Liberia and Panama on
the agency's most important com-
mittee. These countries rank third
and eighth in the world's registered
tonnage. The U.S. was rebuffed.
An account in Lloyd's List & Ship-
ping Gazette in late February in-
dicates the vigor with which British
shipping interests are opposing not
only this registry of American-
controlled ships in Liberia and Pan-
ama, but also our subsidies and our
law which requires that 50 per cent
of foreign-aid cargoes be shipped un-
der the U.S. flag. Clarence G. Morse,
chairman of the Federal Maritime
Board, has stood firmly behind all
these protective policies. And so has
the Department of Defense.
With reference to the rebuff in
London, Morse stated that in his
opinion the American-controlled Pan-
HonLib vessels would never be reg-
istered under the U.S. flag, that they
should not be registered under Euro-
pean flags, and that so far as their
availability in case of crisis is con-
cerned, they are safely ours to use.
He concluded, however, that the real
problem is the campaign of the mari-
time unions against them and called
the plans of the American unions to
organize their crews a major threat to
United States mobilization plans.
I have consulted Adm. Emory S.
Land, whose experience as head of
the Maritime Commission and War
Shipping Administration and whose
knowledge of present conditions
highly qualify him to comment further
on this problem. Next week I shall
present Admiral Land's views.
