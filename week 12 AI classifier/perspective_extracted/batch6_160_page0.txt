**The States and the Gas Tax**

by Raymond Moley

SANTA BARBARA, CALIF.—The President's proposal to the Conference of Governors of a new $50 billion highway program must have originated in the same quarter as a speech delivered to the same group by one of his economic advisers. For both suggest that bigger pump priming is the order of the day. The adviser said significantly that the President's program contains "billions of dollars of economic punch and stimulation." This is in the true spirit of the late Lord Keynes.

To spend $50 billion in addition to the $40 billion already anticipated for highways would indeed be a punch. It is not clear who would be on the receiving end of the punch, or, indeed, who would deliver it. No doubt, Congress would like to pass out this huge sum. If it were allowed to do so, it would have a pork barrel so vast as to overshadow anything we have known in the past.

But the governors, despite their polite remarks, are not likely to retreat from their long-held contention that the gasoline tax should be returned to the states. Their argument is sound in principle and logical in practice.

Unless the states are to become mere provinces of a super-government, they must recover some of their lost functions and tax sources. One of the most important of the former is highway construction and maintenance, and the most obvious of the latter is gasoline. There is also policing and regulating the highways, which is supremely important in highway safety. This must, in the nature of things, be done by the states and localities.

Indispensable means of maintaining a state's identity are pride and friendly rivalry with other states. That pride is already manifesting itself in great road and highway programs, with freeways, throughways, and turnpikes. If the Federal colossus should take over, state pride and rivalry will vanish.

There is also the obvious fact that the states, relying for the most part on their gas tax, are making vast progress in highway construction. The President suggests in his message that the highways of the nation are primitive and decadent. He mentions an army convoy which he accompanied 35 years ago which spent two months in crossing the continent. He and his advisers should travel the same route now. They would discover a miraculous change. I have seen most of that change take place in the course of eleven long trips during the eight years since the war.

But most important of all, there is the matter of financial equity. When the Federal government takes, it never gives a fair return in grants-in-aid. It takes from a few Peters and gives to many Pauls and keeps a big kitty for itself. In 1952 it took $73 million in gas taxes from California and returned $26 million in highway aid. Meanwhile, it took from the other highest ranking states—New York, Texas, and Pennsylvania—the sums of $53 million, $52 million, and $47 million respectively. These states also ranked highest in what they collected for themselves: California, $166 million; Pennsylvania, $126 million; New York, $110 million; and Texas, $107 million. Last year, with a 6-cent tax, California took $200 million.

Sparsely settled states in which travel is light and in which vast acreage is Federally-owned deserve help in the form of flat subsidies.

Finally, there is the question of what, literally, the traffic will bear. The Automobile Manufacturers Association calculated that in 1952 there was an aggregate tax of $583 on every $2,000 car before it reached a highway. Here in California the cost of every gallon of gas includes the difference between 12 cents at the refinery and around 30 cents at the station. Eight cents of the difference is accounted for by Federal and state direct taxes.

Also there are probably at least 150 indirect taxes. There is a point of diminishing returns in taxation and further government exactions, state or Federal, might fail to pay for the ambitious program now proposed. It might be well to hear some more expert testimony before such an adventure in spending is undertaken.
