**How to Keep Our Liberty**

by Raymond Moley

TWENTY-SEVEN months ago in this
space I presented an article under
the title "Organizing for Freedom."
That article said, in brief, (a) that a
majority of the eligible voters in this
country were opposed to current gov-
ernment policies tending toward so-
cialism; (b) that this majority suffered
because it had no means of organized
expression; (c) that the Republican
Party alone could not mobilize
this majority; (d) hence
citizens concerned in pre-
serving their liberty should
be organized in a group or
groups outside the parties
to provide the votes neces-
sary to the election of sound
and conservative candi-
dates, Republican or Demo-
crat, North and South.

There was an extraordi-
nary reaction to that article. I received
more letters from readers in the month
that followed than in the whole pre-
ceding year. Those letters, from all
sections and from all ranges among
our people, made it clear that these
correspondents shared my feeling that
we were following a dangerous social-
istic course, that the political parties
alone would not save us, and that
there was vital need for citizen action.
But scores of them asked: "What can
be done about it?"

This question, repeated over and
over, was a challenge that weighed
very heavily on my conscience. I de-
cided to expand my answer in a small
book. The task of spelling out the
answer proved to be very, very diffi-
cult. For it involved answering in de-
tail not one, but four questions:

Exactly how and why are present
Federal policies imperiling our liberty?
What methods and policies should
be substituted for them?

Who are those Americans in the
great middle group who have most to
lose through statism and who have
potentially the major political power
of the nation?

How can these people be mobilized
in political action?

After six months of work, my project
was only a collection of notes. Then
there was another year of hard think-
ing, inquiring, writing, and rewriting.
Then I submitted my draft, in whole
or in part, to many people for criticisms
and suggestions. Finally, after two
years my answer was finished. Its
name is "How to Keep Our Liberty."*
If those who wrote to me and all
others among the readers of this col-
umn who are disturbed by present
political trends will read this book,
they will find the best answer that
I can give.

The book seeks to show in detail
how the threat of supergovernment or
statism endangers most of
all that great middle-income
group of Americans which
owns most of the property
of the nation and possesses
most of its potential voting
power. In recent years this
group has come to include
the bulk of wage earners
and farmers.

This group, despite its
potential power, has invited
the danger that threatens it by
neglecting its political responsibilities.
Thus, it has presently delivered itself
into the hands of leaders who by sow-
ing class antagonisms and by making
irresponsible promises are seeking
dominant power in the nation.

Finally and most important, I out-
line the means by which this great
middle-income group can be mobi-
lized at the polls in defense of its
material and nonmaterial interests-in
short, how it can become the most
permanent and reliable defender of
American liberty. It describes the sort
of people who should be leaders of
citizens' political movements, the rela-
tions of such movements to one or the
other of the major parties, and the
methods which they should use.

IN SHORT, my book is a call for mili-
tant political action to halt the im-
pairment of our free institutions, to
improve the capacity and integrity of
our government, to relieve the burden
of excessive taxation, to arrest the
blight of inflation, and to build a sound
future by safe, progressive policies.
This book should be dedicated to
those who read my original column in
November 1949 and who took the
trouble to write to me. It is, in fact, so
dedicated, in these terms: "To those
Americans who share the middle in-
terests and who can save themselves,
if they will."
