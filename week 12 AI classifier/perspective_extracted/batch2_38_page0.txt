**PERSPECTIVE**

**THE GOP CHAIRMANSHIP**

**BY RAYMOND MOLEY**

Barry Goldwater has confounded his critics by his attitude toward the chairmanship of the Republican National Committee. Goldwater has also demonstrated clearly what his friends have always known—that he believes that a party is a party and not a sect. It is true statesmanship to realize that "politics is the art of the possible."

The selection of Ray Bliss as the future chairman is no reflection upon Dean Burch, who has carried his campaign burden, as well as the unfair demand that he be crowned with the horns of a sacrificial goat, with dignity and forbearance. Indeed, Ray Bliss himself said a few weeks ago that Burch had been one of the best of many Republican chairmen.

The interim before the pilots are changed in April might well be dedicated by the National Committee, when it meets on Friday the 22nd, to a much needed evaluation of its responsibility.

To cite an example of the sort of common sense that should prevail, I am permitted to quote from a letter written by a member of the National Committee to a colleague in another state. The writer of this letter is a mature, substantial citizen who has been successful in leading his party in his state for some years.

**COMMITTEE RESPONSIBILITY**

He says: "I feel strongly that the National Committee should promptly re-examine and re-evaluate the Republican Party from top to bottom—its methods, its techniques, its practices—to the end of making recommendations as to the changes that should be made to assure a strong, dynamic party. The study suggested should be thorough, objective, and free of ideological differences. It should be motivated from within the committee, not from without. That is all-important.

"If the Republican Party is to succeed, it must establish unity within a common purpose. That will not be so difficult. But it cannot be done in two days. The purposes would not require that all Republicans think alike on every detail. Certainly, there is ample room within the framework of a common purpose for differences on specifics in national policies and for unity as well."

It is almost providential that Ray Bliss is available to serve a beleaguered, weakened, and measurably divided party. He personifies the ideal in experience, judgment, and energy needed as a party manager. Nearly four years ago in an article in this space I suggested the selection of Bliss at that time:

"The old tradition of part-time, unpaid national chairmen limits the choice to those with another public job or those of independent wealth. But the conditions now prevailing and the opposition that must be faced call for a man who would be a real manager, who can strengthen the headquarters staff, and whose help and direction will be accepted by state and local organizations. Such an individual should speak the language of these organizations."

**THE BLISS RECORD**

Moreover, I am privileged to add that William Miller, who became National Chairman at that time, told me more than a year ago that he wanted Bliss to succeed him when he resigned. But until now Bliss has been unwilling to leave his highly successful organization in Ohio.

For seventeen years he has managed the affairs of the GOP in Ohio. He has not professed to be a party evangelist. There are others—plenty of others—to create the issues and expound them at party meetings. While Bliss is conservative, he has not sought to dictate ideology. His genius as a manager has the admiration of state chairmen and party leaders everywhere. And no faction or section of the Republican Party can justly oppose his selection. For he is in every respect a proven professional in the best possible sense of the word.

The Republican Party in Ohio suffered a disaster at the polls in 1958 because against the advice of Bliss and Senator Bricker a group of industrialists put a right-to-work proposition on the ballot. In the two years that followed, Bliss organized and inspired party workers in the state, and Ohio gave Nixon the largest majority he had in any state. In 1962 Republicans swept the state. Bliss is thus abundantly qualified for the present task of giving new hope to a defeated GOP.
