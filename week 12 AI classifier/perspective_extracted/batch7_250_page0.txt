**Perspective**

**If the Republicans Win the House**

by RAYMOND MOLEY

This column is not concerned
with prophecy. But it requires no seer's
vision to note that in the past three
weeks there have been authentic signs
of a powerful, not to say overwhelm-
ing, tide against the party in power.
If this trend carries on until election,
we shall have not only a Republican
House by a comfortable margin, but
quite conceivably a Republican Senate
as well. There may be a
change in the trend, of
course. A Moses may appear
who will smite a rock from
which steaks, chops, and
world peace will spring
forth. But at this writing
neither a Moses nor a rock
is visible.

If the House goes Repub-
lican, what will happen?
The major change will be
in the control of the com-
mittee system. Under the La Follette
reorganization, there will be fewer
committees, but most of the work of
existing committees will go on in sub-
committees. Under a Republican ma-
jority, all chairmanships will change
and an interesting sectional angle
will develop.

In the old House, the chairmen of
the seventeen committees which were
most important to the economy of the
country came from the following sec-
tions: from the eleven Western States,
one; from the twelve Midwestern
States, three; from the nine Eastern
States, two; from the sixteen Southern
and Border States, eleven. If the Re-
publicans had been in the majority,
the chairmen would have come from
the following sections: from the West,
one; from the Midwest, eight; from
the Northeast, eight; from the South
and Border States, none. Under the
reorganization, it may be assumed
that, if the Republicans win, the chair-
men of committees and subcommittees
will be overwhelmingly from the Mid-
west and Northeast.

The vast labor, management and
agricultural interests which lie be-
tween Maine and Nebraska have not
only been grossly underrepresented in
the effective machinery of the past
eight Congresses, but they will, under
a Republican Congress, be consider-
ably overrepresented. The new indus-
trial South will lose out. A most inter-
esting article by W. G. Herron, elabor-
ating this idea, appears in the current
issue of "Western Industry."


With a firm control of the House,
Republican leaders can initiate and
pursue a thorough investigation of the
Administration and of their fellow
members. A government in the hands
of a single party for fourteen years
needs something in the nature of an
outside audit. That this prospective
audit will have 1948 politics as an
objective is unfortunate but unavoid-
able. A political audit is
better than no audit.

The course of legislation
may be similar to that of
the Congress just closed.
The coalition will go on.
The White House will have
its veto.

Most important will be
the opportunity and com-
pulsion offered Republican
leaders to build up national
policies in labor, agricul-
ture, finance and other fields. This is
essential to them if they hope to get
a vote of confidence. Twice their
Presidential candidates have been em-
barrassed by the spotty record of Re-
publican minorities in Congress. This
can be avoided by fine thinking, co-
operation and vision and need not
involve any essential departure from
the social and economic principles
now recognized in both parties. Nor
need it carry partisanship into foreign
affairs. If the Republican party cannot
outdo the witless Truman program,
it deserves oblivion.

The major issue this year and in
1948 should be simply good govern-
ment. Republicans should know that
their local successes in recent years
have been due to that. Dewey, Bricker,
Warren, Stassen and others have been
elected and reelected because they
have been known as competent ad-
ministrators of prosaic but essential
state services. Their ideological effu-
sions have been incidental and merely
decorative. Everybody believes in so-
cial justice, honesty, a fair deal for
labor, et cetera. I, for one, am sick of
speeches which insult American intelli-
gence by claiming a party has a mon-
opoly of what some New Yorkers call
"umanitarianism." Ninety per cent of
what government needs in peacetime
is the ability to read figures, to employ
competent people, to care for the un-
fortunate, to plan for the future and to
keep people from exploiting each other.
This might well be a standard to which
a great majority might happily repair.
