**STRUGGLE FOR THE LAND**

**BY RAYMOND MOLEY**

The history of nations as well as what we hear of the birth pangs of emerging nations today should remind us that although independence and freedom are fighting words, their meaning is relative and indeterminate. They are symbols of a more concrete human aspiration. Land and the enjoyment of its fruits are solid realities. Land is the root of human survival. Everywhere on every continent and at all times submerged peoples have struggled to throw off the monopoly of land by a few who have exploited those who, by the application of labor to natural resources, have created wealth.

A vivid reminder of this is in Jules Abels' book, "The Parnell Tragedy," which was reviewed in NEWSWEEK June 20. It is possible that more has been written about Charles Stewart Parnell's short and stormy career than that of any other European political figure in the nineteenth century. The Irish are an articulate people, and after the tragic downfall and death of their leader, loyal friends, relatives and bitter detractors rushed into print with enormous and often unreliable detail.

In writing this splendid book Jules Abels enjoyed several advantages. He wrote from a perspective of the 75 years since Parnell's death. He is not Irish and could write with feeling unmixed with passion. His craftsmanship has grown with the writing of four earlier books. But most important of all, he was a professional economist before he turned to writing as a career. Thus, he understood clearly that the land question was the real cause of the long Irish Revolution. Repeal of the Union, Home Rule, free elections and an Irish Parliament were means, not ends.

**PARNELL'S LIEUTENANT**

Parnell's knowledge of economics and Irish history was spotty. The intellectual direction of the cause he led came largely from Michael Davitt, Parnell's lieutenant until the breakup of the Land League and later the Irish parliamentary party. In one of his sojourns in prison, Davitt reached the conclusion that the Irish farmer—and there were 600,000 tenant farmers in Ireland then—could never be moved to revolution unless he could see as its end freedom from the oppression of the English landlords.

It is most important to note, as Abels says, that Davitt was a friend and disciple of the American economist and land reformer, Henry George. They met during one of the speaking tours of Davitt and Parnell in the United States. George was a prophet more honored abroad than in his homeland. He first saw land monopoly in California as a journalist and then spent three years in Philadelphia studying classical economics. His famous book, "Progress and Poverty," came out in 1879 when Parnellism began its rise. George visited England and conferred at length with Davitt. While there was and is plenty of need for land-value taxation in the United States, the concepts of George were less effective here. For except in California and the Deep South, there was little agitation among farm workers or tenant farmers. The vast reaches beyond the Appalachians opened the way to free farming.

**FRUSTRATED ALLIANCE**

Davitt communicated George's ideas to Parnell and, although Parnell was a landlord himself, he became the implacable enemy of landlordism. In Cincinnati he said: "Feudal tenure and the rule of the minority have been the cornerstone of English misrule. Pull out the cornerstone, break it up, destroy it and you undermine English misrule. Let us not forget that this is the ultimate at which all Irishmen aim."

English beneficiaries of Irish land were not so numerous, but they were in powerful positions of influence, especially in the Tory party. The Irish members in the House of Commons, by frustrating all legislation (cloture originated then) and in alliance with Gladstone's Liberals, obtained substantial relief for Irish tenants. Had the alliance continued and had Gladstone won an effective majority, the reforms might have been completed. But Parnell's wretched love affair, his neglect of his followers and his failing health permitted his party to break up and sever its ties with the Liberals. Home Rule waited for another generation. Its price then was in blood and shattering civil disorder.
