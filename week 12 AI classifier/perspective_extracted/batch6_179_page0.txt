**The Art of Political Warfare**

*by Raymond Moley*

THERE is special significance in the promotion by GOP Chairman Leonard Hall of Robert Humphreys from the position of public-relations director to that of campaign director. It is intended to free the time and energies of a highly gifted and experienced political strategist for the thinking and planning essential to a momentous political campaign. Those of us who knew Bob Humphreys during the years when he was an editor of this magazine well know that he has a brain fit for fine thinking in the complex art of politics. He is, in the most complimentary sense, a pro.

He has, above all, a deep sense of the realities and of the fundamental principles of politics. Years in the newspaper business have left him with not merely the usual assortment of more or less interesting anecdotes of the great and near-great, but with a firm philosophy of politics and life built of solid pieces chipped from the rocks of human experience. This is unattainable for most of those who venture into politics from more specialized callings. For politics is the art of all things human. Woodrow Wilson, cribbing from Walter Bagehot, a journalist, said that "nothing that is human is alien to the science of politics."

not intent upon taking the lives of Republicans; they only want to take their livelihoods. There has been too much silly talk about cooperation; about how partisanship should be forgotten in a noble gesture of disarmament. You cannot be too kind to people who are intent upon taking your jobs, violating your principles, and proving that you are stupid, incompetent, and corrupt. There is a parallel here with military warfare. There can be lulls in the firing, but never safely a real truce.

In a very shrewd book on political strategy, "The Game of Politics," by Philip Cambray, who had long experience in the British Conservative Party, there is this comment:

"In political warfare the defeat of the opposition is essential to complete victory. If the politician believes what he declares will be the consequences of his opponent's success, he can have no alternative but to use every effort which the law allows to prevent that catastrophe. Sentiment should have no more place in the political conflict than in military warfare. To regard the Opposition as merely mistaken in its ideas and not as deliberately dangerous is wholly subversive of the will to win...The mental attitude which conceives political opponents as persons to be pacified and even to be met halfway must be repressed. Such advances encourage the enemy, damp the enthusiasm of supporters, and suggest to neutrals that there is no real difference between, say, Tweedledum and Tweedledee."

WHEN in 1952 the Republican campaign had sagged down to the "dry-creek" stage, it was Humphreys as much as anyone who impressed upon the high command the need for a vigorous attack. What was true of strategy then is true again this yearâ€”not merely the defense of a rather innocuous, uninspiring legislative program, but a portrayal of what would happen again if the Fair Deal returns. No one can supply that portrayal better than Robert Humphreys. That is why Chairman Hall was so wise in selecting him for this new assignment.
