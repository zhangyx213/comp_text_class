**Perspective**

**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

**'Life's Morning March'**

Amid a good deal of confusion,
the so-called World Youth Congress, meeting at Poughkeepsie, fought its way to an
end—a fairly hazy and futile end, but an
end. Charges that it was dominated by
Communists were made, and these charges
were supported by arresting evidence. The
truth seems to be that Communists were
a fairly big influence and that the pink
stooges and "fellow travelers" with whom
Communists dearly love to associate were
there in considerable numbers. It is also
clear that it was far from a representative
gathering of even American youth. It
seemed to be smothered in a confusion of
tactics. Communists thought they were
using collective-security advocates and
collective-security advocates thought they
were using Communists.

But this country can survive such a
gathering and can find something to admire in the concern of the assembled
youngsters for peace, even though it can
deeply distrust the methods they propose.
There need be no cause for alarm. Suppression is not an American habit. Thanks to
the Bill of Rights, pink stooges, fellow
travelers and even Communists are entitled to say their say.

Which brings us to the nub of the whole
question—the Bill of Rights. The Bill of
Rights, as many modern critics of the
Supreme Court and the Constitution seem
to forget, is the fruit which grows on the
constitutional tree. This coming December
15 happens to be the 150th anniversary of
the adoption of the first ten amendments
to the Constitution, which, collectively,
constitute our Bill of Rights. Appropriate
celebration of this American credo is in
order. And now that complete freedom has
been afforded for all of the sundry isms
that cropped up in Poughkeepsie, it seems
a good idea to bring American youth to a
renewed appreciation of the basic American system itself.

A center for such a mobilization of the
loyalties of American youth offers itself in
the establishment of the National Re-
Dedication, a movement for liberty and
democracy, which consists of a true representation of a great many American
adult and youth organizations, including
the Boy Scouts, the American Federation
of Labor, many Catholic and Jewish organizations, the Federal Council of
Churches of Christ in America. Men of
such divergent political views as Herbert
Hoover, Norman Thomas, James R. Garfield, Sidney Hillman and Victor Ridder


are active supporters. It is planning to
bring to the attention of the country in
December the great American values whose
anniversary we celebrate then.

It will be well for millions of young
people to be reminded that they must dedicate themselves to something positive—
something that thoroughly represents the
essential American tradition. In the midst
of a world babbling of new isms, Americans can profitably turn their attention to
a reaffirmation of the tradition that has
proved itself through 150 years of trial.

**Felix Frankfurter**

Comment concerning the possible
appointment of Professor Felix Frankfurter to the present vacancy on the Supreme Court is characteristic of the wide
public interest in recent Court appointments. Of the many editorials which have
appeared, even those in newspapers which
have been severely critical of Mr. Roosevelt have urged the appointment of Professor Frankfurter as fitting.

During the Supreme Court fight, I expressed my belief, on this page and before
the Senate Committee on the Judiciary,
that, while an increase in the number of
judges for the purpose of influencing the
decisions of the Court was wholly to be
condemned, there was no reason why the
President, in filling vacancies in the ordinary course of events, should not recognize the social, economic and political
views of his appointees as well as their
professional qualifications. It is sheer hypocrisy to deny that the Supreme Court is
not, in a large sense, a policy-making body.
Consequently, a President, elected by the
people to carry out certain policies, has
the right to choose men who will not be
hostile to such policies. But at all times
the men selected should be possessed of
such intellectual attainments, such basic
adherence to the broad principles of the
American scheme of things and such personal integrity, that the Court can remain
as it has been, the respected arbiter of our
liberties. The President recognized this
need in the appointment of Mr. Reed.

It may be that criticism and some Senatorial objections will be registered if the
President appoints Mr. Frankfurter. Such
objections will arise largely from mistaken
notions of Mr. Frankfurter's attainments
and views. Therefore, it might be well now
to tear down the veil of mystery with
which Mr. Frankfurter's own modesty and
the public's surmise have enveloped him.
The well-meaning suggestion, in a number of recent editorials, that Mr. Frankfurter ought to be appointed to carry on
the Holmes tradition is unfair to Mr.
Frankfurter. Men ought to be appointed
to the Supreme Court not as substitutes
for the distinguished dead, but as new and
vital factors in the interpretation of our
fundamental law. Viewed in that capacity,
Mr. Frankfurter well deserves a place of
his own. He is not a Holmes, because Holmes was a faintly fatalistic believer in letting people learn by their own mistakes,
while Frankfurter would passionately prevent the people from making mistakes as
he sees them.

On economic questions Mr. Frankfurter
takes the position that the welfare of the
country depends upon the restoration of a
large measure of competition. Like most
lawyers, he places what seems to me an
excessive trust in the efficacy of legal regulation. To some extent he envisions the
frontiers of social and economic progress
as existing in that cloudy mountain pass
where the lawyers for the people are at
death grips with the lawyers of privilege.
There are those who have a less exciting
picture of the part lawyers play in social
evolution, those to whom progress is an
eternal march into the wilderness of human
relationships—an exploration, not a war.
Nevertheless, the public need have no fear
that he would be anything short of a
magnificent champion of the underdog.
His philosophy is far closer to that of
Gladstone than that of Lenin. In fact, his
intellectual bent is an almost passionate
devotion to the English-speaking tradition.
He has, moreover, a significant respect
for the orderliness of legal processes. There
is every evidence that he has the respect
of an overwhelming number of American
lawyers, even among those whose economic
and social views differ widely from his own.
Despite a diversified career in the public
service, he has made his major contribution as professor in a great law school.
Here he has not given his time, as is suggested by well-meaning but uninformed
commentators in the press, to the job of
legal scholarship. His chief interest has
been in inspiring able students to do fine
work of their own. Many well-known Administration lawyers and dozens of able
young lawyers in conservative law firms
also will testify to his tremendous catalytic powers. His energy and enthusiasm
drive everyone around him to hard work
and aggressive thinking. This, in itself,
might not be an inappropriate influence in
the inner councils of the Supreme Court.
Mr. Roosevelt could add to the basic
and permanent meaning of the New Deal
by appointing Mr. Frankfurter. His appointment would do much to provide for
the vague ideas with which the New Deal
has been clothed, a "local habitation and
a name." If conservatives should undertake actively to oppose the Frankfurter
confirmation they would be doing a dis-
service to conservatism itself.
