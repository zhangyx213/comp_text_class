**Ohio Is Two States**

by RAYMOND MOLEY

CINCINNATI—A touch of spring in
the air down here brings back keen
memories of many a past year in Ohio.
This is the season, especially in years
exactly divisible by four, when po-
litical sap wakes from the suspended
animation of winter. There is talk of
candidates and prospects everywhere—
in clubs and restaurants where lawyers,
newspapermen and politicians lunch, on
trains that shuttle to and
from Cincinnati and Cleve-
land to Columbus and
around 88 courthouses. Old
feuds are recalled and re-
vived, old glories are retold
and new ambitions are born.
This year, the talk is of
Taft's chances for the nomi-
nation and of Stassen's de-
cision to enter the Ohio
primary. That decision to
challenge Taft in his home state might
have been anticipated several months
ago, when Stassen selected a Cleve-
land man, Earl E. Hart, as his Wash-
ington manager. This selection was
made with deliberation. Hart has man-
aged campaigns before, notably when
Harold Burton, now a Supreme Court
justice, was running for the Senate.
The Burton fight involved a contest
within the Republican party between
the north and south of the state. The
lines drawn then will be drawn again,
and Hart will be in charge.

THE Stassen management will enter
candidates for delegates in a num-
ber of the 22 Congressional districts.
Two Stassen delegates are to be entered
as delegates-at-large. It seems to be
Stassen policy not to contest all four
places for delegate-at-large. Some of
the Stassen entries will be extremely
attractive to voters and may win not
so much because of Stassen's popular-
ity as because of their own appeal. At
this moment, it seems almost certain
that Stassen will get some delegates,
principally from districts in and around
Cleveland. It is estimated in Cleveland
that he can win from five to eight with
great ease.

Taft's friends throughout the coun-
try should not regard Stassen's win-
ning delegates in Ohio as a real upset.
It is an old tradition that the north and
the south disagree politically. This split
prevails in both parties. Fifty years
ago, it was Hanna vs. Foraker. Even

in 1908, when William H. Taft backed
by T. R. swept into the nomination on
the first ballot, four stubborn Ohio
delegates voted for someone else. In
1912, T. R. defeated Taft in the Ohio
primaries. In 1912 also, Ohio staged a
bitter internecine fight on the floor of
the Democratic convention in Balti-
more. Cleveland went for Wilson; the
rest of the state was pledged to Gov.
Judson Harmon of Cincin-
nati. In 1920, Cincinnati
refused to go along with
Harding and, as Harry
Daugherty bitterly re-
counted in his memoirs, a
group of thirteen delegates
led by Boss Hynicka of Cin-
cinnati cast their votes for
Gen. Leonard Wood.

It will be no disgrace or
repudiation for Senator Taft,
therefore, if Stassen steals several votes.
It will be in the Ohio pattern, rooted
in the divergent economic outlook be-
tween the country bordering on Lake
Erie and the valley of the Ohio.
Leading the Taft candidates in the
primary will be Sen. John W. Bricker,
the most potent Ohio vote getter in
our time. Bricker's position in the pre-
convention fight is singularly difficult.
He is sincerely committed to Taft, just
as Taft was committed to him in 1944,
as he was committed to Taft in 1940
and, believe it or not, as Taft was com-
mitted to him as a favorite son in 1936.
This Alphonse-Gaston act has now had
a record run of twelve years.

Bricker is most anxious to indicate
his support for Taft, but if he becomes
too active, he may be accused of trying
to steal the show. If he is silent, he may
be accused of indifference. If he ap-
pears prominently in the convention,
there is genuine fear in the Taft circles
that the convention might stampede
to Bricker. For Bricker's stalwart Re-
publicanism and valiant campaigning in
1944 have made him very popular with
organization people everywhere.

PEOPLE here who are close to Taft
say frankly that their man is not
really running against Dewey, Stassen
et al, but against his party's fear that
he cannot win. For that reason, the
great Democratic rout in the Bronx
helps Taft more than any other Repub-
lican candidate. Mr. Truman's fatal
weakness in the big cities is now clear.
