FOR A BETTER CONGRESS
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

A t about this time in October, most
conscientious voters form the de-
cisions which they record on polling
day in November. Very few elections
are decided in the last ten days.
And for that reason it is a good time
to sift out from the innumerable
smaller issues this year the one pre-
dominant factor which should be
weighed by voters.

This country needs a stronger, more
disciplined and more discriminating
Congress. We have not had such a
Congress in the past two years. The
result has been an accumulation of
legislation, the implementation of
which will plague the courts and the
executive departments for many
years. Bills have been passed which
few of those who voted for them
really understood. And few considered the long-term consequences of
the impact upon the Executive and
the country.

RAYBURN'S VIEW

The reason for this is that the campaign of 1964 was fought in a dense
fog of irrelevancies. Hollow expressions were bandied about—"liberal,"
"conservative," "moderate," "extremism"—expressions which no one
clearly understood, simply because
they were designed to obscure rather
than to reveal meaning. It was a campaign in which fright, prejudice and
irrational emotion predominated. The
product of the electoral sweep that
followed was a Congressional majority ideally suited to be the supine
creature of a President who was all
too willing to exploit its weakness. A
legislative vacuum was created into
which there moved the President,
fortified by long experience, ambition and the skillful use of patronage,
pressure and threat of punishment.

The Democratic majority was so
large that the leadership could not
exercise the restraint and discipline
so essential to orderly procedure.

In the election of 1942 a Democratic majority was reduced from 268
to 218—a margin of only ten. Before
that election the late Sam Rayburn
told me that as Speaker he would be
quite happy with the result. He said
that the bigger a majority he had to
manage, the more difficult it was to
impose upon it rational and intelligent control. Assured of the success

of any measure proposed by the President, members would wander about,
organize in groups and cliques, absent themselves from roll calls and
generally dissolve into an unruly
mob. When the party balance was
narrow, he said, good sense and
compromise could prevail. And attention to the business of legislation
would be sharper and more effective.
A green freshman member is always
a liability to his party's leadership.

The big sweep in 1964 not only
added half a hundred such green and
inexperienced members to the majority in the House, but it swept away
an equal number of experienced Republicans, most of them by a small
margin of votes. And any old hand in
the House will tell you that in considering the merits of legislation there is
a great deal of interdependence and
cooperation between the parties in
the committees. The loss was not only
to the Republican Party but to the
Democratic leadership as well.

The essence of a constitutional system is balance—between the two major
parties, between the legislative
and executive branches and between
Federal, on the one hand, and state
and local responsibility on the other.

THE PREDOMINANT ISSUE

Sound legislation is not created by
votes on the floor. It is created by
careful and intelligent and judicious
action in the vital committees. There
the voice of the minority can be
heard and the wisdom of experienced members can be enjoyed. A
better legislative product is thus
created and the national interest is
served.

Valuable and experienced Democrats have died or retired, or have
been defeated in the primaries. Democratic voters should exercise wise
judgment by replacing them either
with good Democrats or Republicans.
And so it is to be hoped that, despite the divisive influences of the racial conflict and of the Vietnamese
war, intelligent voters will attempt to
right the imbalance so unfortunately
created by the irrational and emotional climate of 1964. Let us forget
the slogans of that unhappy year and
vote for a better balance, a more experienced and a more representative
Congress in 1966.
