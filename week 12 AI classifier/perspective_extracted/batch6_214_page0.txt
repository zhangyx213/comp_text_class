'Vested in a Congress'-II

by Raymond Moley

LAST week my piece on this page
started with Article I, Section 1,
the first words of the Constitution
proper. Those words bear repetition,
for they make clear the significance
of the constitutional amendment pro-
posed by John W. Bricker and nearly
two thirds of his Senate colleagues:
"All legislative powers herein
granted shall be vested in a Con-
gress of the United States,
which shall consist of a
Senate and a House of
Representatives."

In the long Senate de-
bate that may be before us,
embellished with vast legal-
istic erudition on both sides,
it may be well for the citi-
zen to lay hold of three
simple directives in this
quotation: (a) it gives Con-
gress "all," not some legislative pow-
ers; (b) the authority of Congress to
legislate shall be limited to those
powers set forth in the Constitution,
and (c) the House is an integral
part of Congress.

Let us consider the Bricker amend-
ment on the background of those
three directives.

The mischief all started with some
loose language by the usually careful
Justice Holmes in a case in 1920. That
case, Missouri vs. Holland, had to do
with a treaty dealing with migratory
birds and an act of Congress carrying
out the terms of the treaty which
were in conflict with the authority of
Missouri. Holmes, sweeping away the
law of more than a century, declared
the treaty to be supreme and, in
fact, to have given to Congress a
right it did not have before.

Thus, a treaty ordinarily under-
stood to deal only with international
affairs moves squarely into the field
of domestic legislation and, in fact,
supersedes the Constitution of the
United States. The protection of an
international duck takes precedence
over the constitutional protections of
American citizens.

Section 2 of the Bricker amend-
ment would override that opinion. It
says that "a treaty shall become effec-
tive as internal law in the United
States only through legislation which
would be valid in the absence of
treaty." It thus restores the limitation
on the powers of Congress stated in
the words "herein granted" above.
It also puts the protective arm of
the courts over the Constitution by au-
thorizing them to pass upon the con-
stitutionality of a treaty (Section 1).
Finally, it restores to the House its
proper share in the exercise of "all
legislative" power by Section 2. That
simply means that when a treaty deals
with a subject covered by "internal
law," the House as well as
Senate must agree. It wipes
out the false logic of the
present law, that the part
is greater than the whole.
Under the present situa-
tion, the House is denied a
share in matters of internal
legislative concern. The
Holmes opinion simply cut
the House out of a very
large area of the authority
given to it by the Constitution.
Dulles himself admits that "treaty
law can override the Constitution"
and "cut across the rights given to the
people by the Bill of Rights." He also
says that treaties actually cooked up
in the United Nations Educational,
Scientific, and Cultural Organization
would not be proper subjects for trea-
ties and the Secretary of State will not
ask the Senate to consent to them-
that is, as long as he is Secretary!
It is the reality of such strange in-
vasions of American rights and law as
the so-called Declaration of Human
Rights of the U.N. that has so alarmed
so many Americans.

THE proposed amendment does not
limit the President and the Secre-
tary of State and the exercise of their
proper treaty-making powers. It sim-
ply says that when a treaty invades
domestic concerns and becomes legis-
lative power, the provisions of the
Constitution giving such power to
"Congress" shall prevail and that the
courts shall be the final judges of con-
stitutionality. Thus the amendment
would protect the American citizen's
rights under the Constitution from
Congress itself.
A bulletin of the State Department
with a foreword by President Truman
said in 1950 that "there is no longer
any real distinction between domestic
and foreign affairs." This should warn
us of what may be in store if quick
action is not taken.
