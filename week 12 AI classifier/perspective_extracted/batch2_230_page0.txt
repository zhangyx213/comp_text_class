**Perspective**

**Tokenism II**

by Raymond Moley

"TOKENISM," as I explained last
week, is the term suitable to the
practice of the three postwar Administration in meeting the dilemma
created by a rising tide of public expectations for Federal benefits on the
one hand and a relatively inflexible
Federal revenue on the other. Nothing much can be done by raising tax
rates. They have already reached the
point of diminishing returns. The Federal government is mortgaged to the
hilt with continuing programs. The
chance of a big rate increase in the
gross national product is remote. Deficit financing would only create
new expenses through inflation. That
would be disastrous.

But people generally and pressure
groups in particular, excited by reckless campaign promises, are pounding
at the doors of government like unpaid rooming-house landladies.

There is no better example than in
public housing.

President Kennedy's housing message to Congress portrayed a colossal
need for new home construction. But
the amount of Federal money he recommended as aid is a paltry payment
on account.

**REFORMS NECESSARY**

A powerful portrayal of the facts
was published in the April issue of
House & Home, the major publication
in the largest industry in the nation,
housing construction. It states that the
President's plan to subsidize 100,000
units would cover two-thirds of 1 percent of the alleged need. Also, that
another $500 million for Federal National Mortgage Association loans
would meet one-third of 1 percent.
The amount recommended for elderly
couples would meet one-half of 1 percent of the stated need. And if, as
the President says, "one-fifth of the
occupied houses" in rural areas are
hopelessly dilapidated, the amount
recommended for their replacement
and improvement would cover only 2
percent of the stated need.

To encourage low-priced building
and to provide Federal funds to buy
reserve lands for future development,
House & Home says, would do more
harm than good.

Neither House & Home nor I suggest that the amounts recommended should be increased. That would be
fiscal madness.

The real means of stimulating home-building should be four changes in
existing laws and practices that would
save billions in Federal expenditures
and home builders' costs:

▸The FHA should prepare, service,
and promote the adoption of a standard building code.

▸Eliminate the archaic system of title
searching and other closing costs.

▸Stabilize the flow of mortgage
money. Eliminate rate fluctuations.

**TAX IDLE LAND**

Most of all, vigorous effort is
needed to cut down the inflated
prices of urban and suburban land.
Much of this inflation is due to the
subsidies given by the Federal government to urban developments and
to uneconomic farming. Squatters and
speculators reap rich, unearned profits. The builder is penalized. Hundreds of millions of such unearned
profits have been made in New York
City alone. The President should give
his moral support to and impose his
influence on governors, legislatures,
and mayors to make assessments
equitable and to tax slums out of existence. At the present time the man
who improves his land is penalized.

In the suburbs where land is available for new housing projects, the price
of land has risen 300 per cent. This
results in what is called "suburban
sprawl," an ugly and uneconomical
way to build an urban community.

It is suggested that if local governments refuse to reform assessments
and fix taxes at a level which will
drive out speculation, the Federal
government might well impose a stiff
ad valorem tax on the present inflated
market price of land, such as was imposed during the first 100 years of the
republic. This would almost certainly
be constitutional if its proceeds were
prorated back to the communities and
states. Thus prices of vacant land
would be deflated, and money would
be made available to the communities
and states. Federal outlays would be
reduced, and there would be more
housing. What the Federal government sadly lacks is ingenuity. It takes
no imagination to spend money and
make unredeemable promises.
