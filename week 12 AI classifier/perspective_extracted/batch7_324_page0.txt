**Security in the Pacific**

by RAYMOND MOLEY

Effective diplomacy consists in
being tough only about vital subjects.
This observation applies with special
emphasis to the ultimate disposition of
the Pacific islands, wrested from Japan
at such bitter cost.

Admiral of the Fleet Ernest J. King
has made it very clear that the Navy
regards the future disposition of these
islands as a matter of critical impor-
tance to our national safety.

And in NEWSWEEK (April
30), Admiral William V.
Pratt explained the defen-
sive importance of some of
them. The cause of alarm
is the loose way some Amer-
icans are throwing around
the word "trusteeship" in
connection with the postwar
status of islands and bases
whose title will change as a
result of this war. "Trustee-
ship" has its place in postwar affairs,
but it has no place in the future of
places essential to our future security.
"Trusteeship" bears such a close rela-
tionship to the delusions and tragic
blunders once committed under the
term "mandates" that its use anywhere
should bear the closest scrutiny.

By tradition and by the grim lessons
of this war, we should have learned
that the peacetime security of our
country has depended and will de-
pend upon a great Navy. What does
the Navy want in the Pacific?

It wants bases that support the
fleet, not bases that depend upon the
fleet. Japan made the decisive mistake
of assuming that a fleet could support
bases.

It was a firm tradition in our di-
plomacy as far back as Secretary Sew-
ard that the defense of our West
Coast depended on a firm position far
in the Pacific. The beginning of that
defense was the acquisition of Alaska
and the Aleutian Islands. Next, we
needed Hawaii. Our need of the
Philippines was debatable, but we ac-
quired them, and they thereby became
part of our Pacific system. Other is-
lands were acquired in the course of
time. But our whole defensive system
was endangered when, after the sur-
render of Germany in 1918, we per-
mitted Japan to secure the Carolines,
the Marshalls and the Marianas as
their price for entering the League of
Nations.

This time, let us listen to the
Navy. The Navy believes that our
major inner defense in the Pacific runs
on a line from the Aleutians south
along the International Date Line to
Samoa.

The security of that line of de-
fense is an equally important series of
islands north of the Equator. That
would include the Marianas, the Mar-
shalls and Guam. Essential
bases there should be closed
to the shipping of other na-
tions. Nor should there be
any international "inspec-
tion" of such bases. Support-
ing this line should be
American stations based on
American sovereignty in
the Bonins, the Volcanos
and the Ryukyus.

The Philippines are re-
garded by the Navy as a
liability but, since our responsibility
there is fixed now and in future, there
should be a powerful American base
there, probably on Mindanao.

This sphere of American power
would involve no essential conflict
with Britain, since treaty arrangements
could afford the British Navy joint or
sole use of harbors in the Marshalls.
Britain, of course, will resume sover-
eignty over the Gilberts.

Beyond this are areas in which some
joint arrangements are possible with
the British, Australians, Dutch, French
and Portuguese. But generally the area
from India to Samoa is appropriately
a British sphere of influence. And the
future will rest in that area, as in
the Atlantic, in a meshing of Anglo-
American interests in perpetual friend-
ship.

Russia apparently does not and
will not object to all this. Nor can
China object. Russian interests will
probably require the Kuriles and the
big island of Sakhalin. These she
should have.

But the time to assert our rights to
these requirements of our security is
now, before and not after Russia en-
ters the Eastern war. Russia is realistic
about Europe. We should be equally
realistic in the Pacific. Permanent
peace will ultimately rest on such
realism. Our security should not again
become the pawn of visionary diplo-
macy. The Navy has saved us. It de-
serves our support.
