**The Pacific Coast and the Future**

by RAYMOND MOLEY

LOS ANGELES—Regardless of the advice of Washington to business and local governments to avoid postwar planning now, the West Coast cities are going ahead full-steam with their planning. The most striking thing I have encountered in my travels out here is the determination of these people to solve the puzzles that lie ahead with a minimum of help or interference from the Federal government.

Portland has employed Robert Moses of New York City, who prepared a city plan for future improvements. L. Deming Tilton of the San Francisco Planning Commission has completed a comprehensive plan for that city. And in Los Angeles, a number of organizations and committees, including the state and the city chambers of commerce, are at work.

The raw figures of industrial growth here make very clear the immense peak that California, in common with other Coast states, has attained and the transcendent importance of trying to see what lies on the other side of that peak. California has received, in three years, more than twelve billions in war contracts—more than any other state. Its population has increased three-quarters of a million. Its industrial employees have increased from 300,000 to more than 850,000. Most of these new workers are in two industries, shipbuilding and aircraft production. One of these days, with little advance notice, the war contracts will be canceled. Later, the California men in the armed services will return and, if those now here remain, 1,400,000 people will be out of jobs—70 per cent more than were employed in 1940.

Already, the peak of employment in ship and aircraft production has been reached. In shipbuilding, the emphasis is being shifted from cargo ships to a number of special types for the Navy. In the aircraft industry, they tell me that employment is being "stabilized." No one can say when the over-all total will start to decline, for the demand for full and even increased production remains.

But a few figures compiled by the aircraft people show how many more planes are rolling out with the same number of workers. For every 100 workers needed to build a Douglas A-20 in 1940, only nine were needed in 1943. In 1940, it required 444 workers one year to build a Consolidated B-24. In 1943, it required only seventeen. In 1940, it took 232 men one year to build a Lockheed P-38. In 1943, it took eleven. In December 1940, in all the Pacific Coast aircraft industries, 87,000 workers built 2,600 planes—a ratio of 33 to 1. In December 1941, the ratio was 22 to 1. In December 1942, the ratio was 16 to 1. In the first seven months of 1943, there was an increase in production of 44 per cent, with an increase of employees of only 20 per cent. All of which shows why production can increase while employment stands still or declines.

**What will happen to these workers when work falls off?** Many will go home. But there has always been a tendency on the part of people who come to these states to stay. Many will take their savings into the country and buy small places to live. There will, of course, be more industry here than before the war. Many small consumer-goods industries will develop. The great Kaiser steel plant, built by the government, may well continue and provide work for a considerable number of dependent industries. There will be more shipbuilding—how much, no one knows—than before the war. The possibility of doing a lot of work outdoors will keep much of the nation’s aircraft building here. The servicing of the greatly enlarged Navy and merchant marine will help. But beyond this, it is obvious that there is sure to be some distress unemployment, unpredictable in size and duration. The California sales tax has given the state government a surplus which will amount to $200,000,000 by July of this year. A great deal of it has been earmarked for public works and relief.

The war and experience with rationing, price control and the rest of Washington’s home-front activities have left the entire West Coast with the feeling that the Federal government is incapable of solving state and local problems. To an amazing degree, people have become convinced that centralized government is worse than a sin: it is a blunder. The conservative trend here reveals itself in politics and economics. Distress may change this, but the hardy citizenry here is determined that distress shall not come again.
