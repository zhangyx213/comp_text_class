**Evil Governments, Not Evil Nations**

by Raymond Moley

WHILE Secretary Dulles is flying
from shore to shore seeking, it
would seem with some difficulty, to
find constant friends among the na-
tions, it might be well to recall once
more the durable fact that it is gov-
ernments, not nations, that possess
qualities of good and evil. This old,
but in our generation almost forgotten,
truth is briefly and with relentless
logic and fact restated by
René Wormser in a new
book, "The Myth of the
Good and Bad Nations."

The country will be hear-
ing a good deal about René
Wormser before long, be-
cause he is the chief counsel
of the Reese Committee of
the House on tax-exempt
foundations. He is a New
York lawyer who has for a
long time watched with anxiety the
fantastically capricious arrangement
and rearrangement of our loves and
hates among nations. Shortly before
his birth we had our last great spat
with Britain. He was born in the era of
our great hate for Spain and has lived
to see us shower friendship and treas-
ure over there in return for potential
help against a nation which was our
comrade in arms only ten years ago.
He was probably unaware of the early
twentieth-century spell of hate for
Czarist Russia. While in uniform dur-
ing our first world crusade, he was
encouraged to believe that interna-
tional sanity was dawning when
Woodrow Wilson made a distinction
between the German people and their
government. That hope died when
the news of the realities of the Ver-
sailles Treaty came out.

The fallacy of a Carthaginian peace
was shown in the bitterness and later
the revolt of Germany. Then, learning
nothing from history, Roosevelt con-
cocted the mad policy of unconditional
surrender, which was interpreted in
Germany as a death warrant for the
German people. Later, that belief was
reaffirmed, and a spirit of last-ditch
resistance was engendered in Ger-
many by the agreement to Harry
Dexter White's Morgenthau plan.

In passing, it deserves to be said
that Sir Winston Churchill in his
memoirs admits that he joined
Roosevelt in approval of that plan be-
cause (a) "we had much to ask" from
Roosevelt and Morgenthau and (b)
because the removal of Germany's in-
dustry might help Britain's economy.
The latter reason is reaffirmed in an
almost incredible passage in Secretary
Stimson's diary in which he tells of
his protest to Roosevelt against the
plan. Roosevelt answered that "his
underlying motive" (in agreement to
the plan) "was the very confidential
one that England was
broke; that something must
be done to give her more
business to pull out of the
depression after the war;
and he evidently hoped
that by something like the
Morgenthau plan Britain
might inherit Germany's
Ruhr business."

It should be further noted
that Churchill, however he
might be condemned for the rash
act of agreeing to the plan, was
never dominated by what Wormser
calls the "myth" of good and bad na-
tions, but by the interests of his coun-
try. It is possible to believe Churchill
when he says that he was forced,
despite his convictions, to agree to
many decisions made by Roosevelt
because Britain would have to de-
pend upon American help during and
after the war.

AND now other leaders are working
with feverish haste to make
amends for the folly of treating Ger-
many and Japan as wicked nations.
Quite correctly, Vice President Nixon
has told Japan that it was all a mistake.
"In determining our objectives and
our major strategy for the immediate
and the distant future," concludes
Wormser, "we must abandon for all
time the cruel and unsound policy of
the good nations and the bad. We
have risked our own security (indeed
the security of the world) by treating
the German, Japanese, and Italian
people as though they were, each as
an entire national group, responsible
for whatever malicious or vicious acts
were committed by their respective
governments and leaders. There are
evil governments and evil leaders.
There are no evil peoples, no evil
nations. Nor can we afford to be led
astray by the concept that any gov-
ernment has the essential and change-
less quality of goodness."
