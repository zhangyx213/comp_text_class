**War Against Disease**

by Raymond Moley

THE injection as a political issue of
the how to provide medical care for
the needy aged is unfortunate for
many reasons. It may turn us into a
nation of hypochondriacs. It makes us
forget the tremendous strides that
have been made to keep more of us
well and to live longer. Madly in pur-
suit of the votes of the mounting num-
ber of voters over 65, the politicians
are forgetting the devoted doctors
and scientists who have provided
those extra years of life.

If politicians were as devoted to
truth as those scientists, they would
have provided as a basis for legisla-
tion more complete and accurate facts
about the number who really need
aid, how much it would cost, and how
best it could be provided by govern-
ment or private agencies. I confess
that after reading hundreds of pages
of argument and statements in Con-
gressional hearings I am unable to
find the answers to these questions.
Anthony Crosland, a Labor M.P.
from 1950 to 1955 and a trained
economist, after his defeat in the lat-
ter year, in an important book "The
Future of Socialism," says "We can-
not afford to spread social expendi-
ture thinly over needy and non-needy
alike, but must concentrate it heavily
on those points where the need
is greatest."


**LONGER LIFE SPANS**

In the current political debate little
is said about the immense gains made
in the science of medicine in the past
few years. But a new book by NEWS-
WEEK'S MEDICINE editor, Marguerite
Clark, on the subject supplies the
facts. It is "Medicine Today: A Re-
port on a Decade of Progress."
Mrs. Clark says that when she
started to write about medicine
twenty years ago, a reporter was
lucky to find one new medical discov-
ery once in six months. "Now we are
getting them at the rate of one every
twenty-four hours."

Longer and longer vistas of active
life are stretching before all of us. The
Biblical span of threescore and ten
has already been reached and by
1966 Mrs. Clark predicts that the ex-
pectancy will be fourscore. And con-
trary to the implications in the
arguments of politicians, the image of
the oldsters is not that of ill, indigent
men and women but to a greater ex-
tent people capable of multiplying
with their work the productive power
of the nation. It is nothing short of
willful waste for government, manage-
ment, and the labor unions to cling to
rules which retire people to a slow
death on the shuffleboards at an ear-
lier and earlier and earlier age. In
language vividly intelligible to the lay
reader, Mrs. Clark tells of the amaz-
ing progress that has recently been
made in shielding people, old and
young, from crippling disease. She re-
views progress in every case from
heart disease and cancer to tooth de-
cay and the common cold.

**THE MAJOR KILLERS**

She cites an impressive number of
authorities who dissipate much of the
current fear of cholesterol as a cause
of heart stoppage. Moreover, much
evidence is cited to show how safely
the heart patient can live and work
after an attack.

The door is slowly opening into the
mysteries of cancer. New drugs are
gaining in efficiency while detection
and surgery have made giant strides.
Mrs. Clark's discussion of the dread,
crippling diseases of the central nerv-
ous system, which she calls "the dis-
eases unconquered," includes multiple
sclerosis, cerebral palsy, epilepsy,
muscular dystrophy, and they offer
the most serious challenge to science.
Their tragic nature lies in the fact that
their attack stretches over unnum-
bered years of suffering and that they
attack so many young people.
Mrs. Clark draws few general con-
clusions. Her purpose is to report
progress. But the reader cannot es-
cape the conclusion that more and
more money for research is the way to
a better and more productive life for
all of us. It is true that the Federal
government is already spending a
good deal on medical research. But
rather than set up vast programs to
bestow benefits on millions, regardless
of need, it would be infinitely more
useful to pinpoint aid for the needy
and expand present research efforts
to supplement what private philan-
thropic and commercial agencies have
been doing with such marked success
under severe limitations of means.
