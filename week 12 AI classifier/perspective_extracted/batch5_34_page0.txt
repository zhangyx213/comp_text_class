**Keys to Atomic Powerâ€”I**

*by Raymond Moley*

No greater problem has faced the people and government of the United States than the adaptation of nuclear energy for peaceful uses. In the course of this year decisions in this field may be made which will affect our lives and political institutions for generations to come. Under the compulsion of fear or of national pride we may perilously compromise the principle of a free competitive economy by greatly enlarging the powers and functions of an already overgrown government.

Within the government itself there is already great stress arising from differences of opinion concerning the proper role of government in the development of nuclear power. This manifests itself sharply in a conflict between the Atomic Energy Commission, representing the Executive, and the Joint Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy. A normal difference of opinion is in this case sharpened by personal incompatibilities and the pursuit of political advantage.

There should be no political or personal difference as to the aim and method of progress. The objective is to provide, within a reasonable time, the energy in the form of electric power which can meet the ever-increasing needs of our nation while we do what we can to help other, less fortunate and friendly countries. The method is that of cooperation, with government on one side and several private interests on the other. The preservation of our essential liberty requires that cooperation.


**SOCIALISM VS. COOPERATION**

A totalitarian regime like that of the Soviets requires no cooperation. Government does everything. All elements are fused in a state tyranny. The principle of socialism is coercion. That of free society is cooperation.

Ultimately, we are assured, the values and rewards under our system are indescribably great; those under tyranny are limited and transitory. Socialism has no proof on its side. We have our experience to assure us.

There should be no party differences on this point. Our policy was fixed by Congress in 1946 and in the 1954 Atomic Energy Act to be: "To promote world peace, improve the general welfare, increase the standard of living, and strengthen free competition in private enterprise."  David Lilienthal, the first chairman of the AEC, said five years before the 1954 act: "The major purpose of the commission's policies should not be the negative one of 'checking' and 'policing,' but the creation of positive incentives that will stimulate private concerns to carry increasingly larger responsibility. Only in this way can great technical progress be made."

President Eisenhower, former President Hoover, and several of the great scientific leaders have echoed this American purpose.


**FOUR KEY INTERESTS**

Four interests are involved in the orderly and adequate development of nuclear energy for civilian use: Educational authorities concerned in training scientists and engineers; manufacturers of nuclear equipment; public and private utilities; and, affecting all of these, the Federal government, principally embodied in the AEC and in Congress.

1-Education: To what extent and in what manner should educational agencies, public and private and industrial, receive government assistance without the danger of Federal control of all education?

2-Manufacturing: The big companies engaged in fabricating the tools for extracting energy from the atom have already made vast contributions to government in war and in peace. To what degree must their outlays in research and in the manufacturing of equipment be protected by the resources of government?

3-Utilities: To what degree can or should private and public manufacturers and distributors of electricity be aided and protected in the years of preparation before the cost of nuclear energy will be competitive with coal, oil, gas, falling water, and other conventional sources of energy?

4-Government: What is the nature of the controversy between the Executive, represented by the AEC, and Congress, represented by the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, and how should it be resolved?

I shall consider these questions in a number of future articles.
