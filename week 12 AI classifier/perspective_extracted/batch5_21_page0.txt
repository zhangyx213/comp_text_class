**Foundations, Pro and Con**

**by Raymond Moley**

For reasons easy to surmise, certain members of the New York and Washington press seem at the moment to have ignored a thoughtful, fair, and thoroughly documented book, "Foundations, Their Power and Influence." Yet they wrote many columns a few years ago attacking two committees of the House which were investigating foundations.

The author, René Wormser of the New York bar, has given most of his 38 years' practice to a subject which lies at the root of foundations, estate dispositions and planning, and his various books on the subject are respected and consulted. In this case, he has not only given commendation to the general usefulness of foundations such as those bearing the names of Ford, Rockefeller, and Carnegie, but has pointed out some of the unfortunate nature and consequences of some of their activities and grants.

Excluding the many which are merely means of tax avoidance, there are about 7,000 foundations, with aggregate assets of nearly $10 billion, concerned with specific fields of social, educational, and economic life. These institutions were born out of tax exemption and represent a great volume of wealth set aside from the sources of public revenues.

**INTO THE UNKNOWABLE**

The original contributions of the Rockefeller Foundation to medical science and public health make a bright page in history. Millions of lives have been spared and lengthened, and much of the misery attending the ills of the flesh has been spared us all. But back in the 1920s a great diversion of interest took place—a diversion which was then bitterly opposed by some of the distinguished men who guided the elder Rockefeller. Social science, in all the ramifications of that word, began its vogue and spread the delusion that human relationships and human conduct, like physical substances and phenomena, were capable of exact empirical measurement.

To further this great adventure into the unknown, there were set up "clearinghouses" for the disposition of grants—project jobbers like the Social Science Research Council. Within these there developed an inner political machine, largely determining the objectives under which favored projects should operate. Conformity to the point of view of those in control qualified the donees. Sometimes patent political movements were supported, such as the League for Industrial Democracy (the Intercollegiate Socialist Society under a new name), and the Institute of Pacific relations. The ideology of those who controlled the grants bent the minds of otherwise useful professors, and college teaching was greatly changed.

**THE REMEDIES**

When the Ford Foundation came along with its mammoth resources, H. Rowan Gaither and his advisers went almost the whole way for the new "science," now known as "behaviorism." Paul Hoffman and Robert Hutchins "sold" this with a mixed jargon drawn from hucksterism and sociology, with occasional medical terms wrenched from their proper place in true science. The big foundations assembled a great bureaucracy of philanthropiods who hatched projects and scattered them over the nation.

Whenever I read of the present neglect of the real sciences such as physics or when I see unkempt and starved hospitals, I think of this major cause of both tragic deficiencies. Wormser wisely points out that the remedy for the foundation activities which he criticizes is not in major legislation, but lies with the boards of directors of the foundations themselves. There should be directors who direct and not merely emboss the annual reports, who represent no conflicting interest between donee and donor, who serve fixed terms and are ineligible for re-election. Boards should put an end to "projectitis" and give grants without strings to responsible colleges and other beneficial institutions—a point of view which I know is held by many college administrators. These institutions have their own established ways of testing and evaluating projects of their own. There should be much greater emphasis upon pure natural science. Finally, there should be continuous scrutiny and legitimate criticism by Congress and the Internal Revenue Service, the nation's legal judges of the problems involved.
