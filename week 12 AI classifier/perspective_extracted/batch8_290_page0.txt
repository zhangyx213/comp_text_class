**Reviving the Court Issue**

Even the casual newspaper reader must have become aware, in the past week, that a new case against the Court is in the making. Commentators who insist that it is only a series of coincidents that has made the Court a front-page political issue again, forget the tenacity and purposiveness with which Mr. Roosevelt is wont to pursue his objectives.

It is true, of course, that, to a degree, the Court itself, or at least one of its members, is responsible for the lapse from grace which is serving to prepare the public mind for a renewal of the Court controversy. Several weeks ago there appeared a magazine article by a newspaper correspondent with a reputation for reliability, attributing to members of the Court disparaging opinions on the ability of Justice Black. The substance of this article has been current gossip in Washington for several months. And while rumors increasingly distort the truth, denials and explanations since the appearance of the article do not conceal indiscreet talk by one or more Justices. The violation of the traditions of the Court thus implied has indeed, if that is any satisfaction to anyone, carried its own punishment with it.

But it is regrettable that it should tend to distort interpretation of a subsequent speech by the Chief Justice before the American Law Institute stressing the need for better judges. There is no justification whatever for the conclusion that he was criticizing his fellow Justices in talking, as he has done on innumerable occasions before and as his predecessors have frequently done, of the judiciary in general. It is entirely appropriate for the Chief Justice to discuss the quality of judicial service, and there are plenty of poor judges on the bench, wholly aside from the question of whether Justice Black should be numbered among them.

But another controversy involving the Court has the air of an argument deliberately provoked in this moment of futile misunderstanding. On April 25, the Court handed down a decision reprimanding the Department of Agriculture for short-cutting proper quasi-judicial procedure. Secretary Wallace, feeling that he was being blamed by the newspapers for a matter that goes back to the Hoover Administration, wrote a letter to The New York Times which went unheeded by the rest of the press. The Chief Justice in his subsequent American Law Institute speech warned quasi-judicial agencies to play fair.

Whereupon Secretary Wallace, assuming that this generalized warning was specifically directed against him, released for publication a letter he had addressed to the Chief Justice.

It is understandable that Secretary Wallace should have wished to correct the journalistic obscuring of the fact that the decision on the Kansas City Stockyards case dealt with a procedure which he corrected almost two years ago. But to attempt this by means of the step, unprecedented in recent times, of addressing a combative letter to the Chief Justice on the merits of the decision and the length of time consumed in the settling of the case is inexplicable—except in terms of an authorization to begin guerrilla warfare against the Court. That is why it is safe to guess that, even after the Secretary is politely reminded that it is the function of the Court to pass on concrete cases and not to engage in controversies with the executive branch, the argument will not be dropped.


**Voluntary Industrial Arbitration**

What the American mind needs most is a restoration of its old habit of dependence upon voluntary, unofficial methods of social and economic betterment. The hopes and fears of all of us have too long been centered in what the government is doing to or about us. Without realizing it, a large proportion of the people of this country have become, not the vassals of an omnipotent state, as frightened pessimists say, but something almost as bad—the intellectual vassals of the idea of an omnipotent and omniscient stateism. And that is not good for individuals or for the state.

One simple remedy for this malady that comes to mind immediately is the nurturing of the old virtue of self-reliance—a self-reliance that finds expression in voluntary, self-sustaining associations.

The best example of a field for such activity is in the realm of labor \_\_\_ations where, in the day-by-day adjustment of the delicate fabric of confidence between management and labor, government is at its best a poor substitute for unofficial mediation and arbitration.

No doubt with this necessity in mind, the American Arbitration Association organized a year ago a voluntary industrial-arbitration tribunal and a procedure by which labor disputes may be settled with all the legality, speed and impartiality with which the association has for years been settling commercial disputes. The

outstanding principles underlying the organization and administration of the tribunal are: that it is an entirely nonofficial, nonpartisan agency for the adjudication of labor disputes; that it offers its facilities on precisely equal terms, under equally fair conditions, to both management and labor; that it offers a panel of arbitrators chosen solely for their integrity, impartiality and competence, who serve without compensation; and that it guides procedure in all cases submitted to it. A board is selected in each case jointly by the disputants. The association is nonpartisan, nonprofit-making and is supported by voluntary subscriptions. Its office is at 8 West 40th Street, New York.

This is a good address for workers and managers alike to have when the next dispute comes along.

**Differentials**

The unanimous enthusiasm with which the New England Congressmen regard the Norton Wage-Hour Bill strongly suggests that they are activated less by the desire to assure a minimum livelihood to all citizens than by the desire to strike at Southern competition. Their purpose does not seem to be to increase the wages paid to employees but to close up a number of Southern plants.

I believe that no Federal wage-hour legislation can be sound unless it is justifiable within the South. That is, it must appeal to a majority of the Southern employers and workers—eventually, if not at once. Southern workers unquestionably favor wage-hour legislation at the present time. But the law must turn out to be one which leaves most of them still employed after it is in force. If it deprives them of jobs, their attitude toward it will change pretty quickly, and, if both Southern workers and Southern employers in large numbers find the law impossibly handicaps them, it will not work very long.

Sincere advocates of wage-hour legislation have always intended that it should be the expression not of a muddy-minded humanitarianism but of a fixed purpose to raise the buying power of industrial workers. It must actually accomplish that purpose or it will fail. At the very least, it must not reduce the buying power of industrial workers. A flat national wage and hour rate, say a 40-40 rule, will not noticeably raise the buying power of Northern workers and will give Southern plants no new market on which to draw in order to meet increased costs. Unless the burdens which wage-hour legislation imposes are distributed pretty evenly over the country, its effects will be unbearable. Unless wage differentials are included in the bill, it will serve ultimately only to discredit the principle of Federal wage-hour legislation.
