**PERSPECTIVE**

**Goldwater on Extremists**

*by Raymond Moley*

GOVERNOR Rockefeller's attack upon
extremists was immediately interpreted in some sections of the press
as a pointed criticism of Senator
Goldwater. The governor later, in response to press questioning, said that
"while I have great respect for
Barry's patriotism, his dedication to
political life . . . I have some concern
whether he may not end up as a
captive of those elements." This raises
certain questions which I shall attempt
to answer in this and a subsequent
article. The first is what has been
Goldwater's attitude toward extremists and extremism? Another, considering the fact that the Rockefeller
statement made a great deal of the
racial issue, what has been Goldwater's record on the racial issue?

The governor is somewhat late in bringing up the question of extremism. In August 1959 in a piece entitled "All or Nothing?" I referred to people who "in the past or recently have expressed, either in print or personally, unhappiness concerning political leaders whose views and votes have not completely and specifically met their own convictions. The vice of such irreconcilability is that it defeats the very objectives which most conservatives are earnestly seeking. This habit, it seems to me, is much more a threat to sound government than all the power and prattle of radicals. The all-or-nothing attitude means a house divided, which cannot stand."

**THE SENATOR AGREES**

Almost immediately after this appeared in print, I had a totally unsolicited letter from Goldwater which expressed thorough agreement with my statement.

Ten months later I returned to the subject in a piece entitled "The Irreconcilables," in which I wrote: "Goldwater is not irreconcilable. He realizes that to throw into sharp reverse the trend of the past 25 years would be inexpedient and self-defeating. What is needed is to slow up the drift to the left before it is too late."

Again I had a letter of commendation and agreement from Goldwater: "Your column is good and I hope we can get the conservatives to take up this line. To put it in a very simple way, the Democrats have their political liabilities, but they say they are Democrats and they vote for Democrats in the hope that they can change them, but with a Republican the answer has been, 'We just don't vote for himâ€”that will teach him a lesson.'"

Essentially, Goldwater believes in attaining reasonably conservative ends through supporting the Republican Party and all its candidates. His moving speech at the Republican convention seconding the nomination of Richard Nixon urged his followers, who were crying out for his nomination, instead to get into the Republican ranks and work and support the ticket. In the campaign which followed, Goldwater made innumerable speeches supporting the Republican Party and all its candidates.

**RECORD ON CIVIL RIGHTS**

In 1962 he was asked whether, if he were a voter in New York, he would support Senator Javits. He said he would, and as chairman of the Senatorial Campaign Committee he actually raised funds for Javits, as he did for all other Republican candidates for the Senate.

In the Rockefeller statement a considerable space is given to the racial issue. For several years after 1946, Goldwater was a member of the NAACP. He was and is a member of the Urban League. As a powerful officer in the Arizona Air National Guard he brought about its integration. When he went to high school in Phoenix the school was integrated. Later it was segregated. But when he was a member of the NAACP after the war he helped to bring about the reintegration of the school and gave money to fight the case in the courts.

Thus the implications in Rockefeller's language are not only unfair to the Arizona senator himself, but a grave reflection upon all those who want to support Goldwater for President. Nobody who has any sense can believe that this man, who has stood so firmly in the minority for conservative principles for so many years, could be a "prisoner" of anybody or anything except his convictions.
