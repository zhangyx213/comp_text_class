**New Light on Southern Politics**

**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

It has seemed to me for a long time that an indispensable means for the improvement of government is a careful, impartial, detailed study of politics in every state in the nation.  But such an analysis is not easy to create. Most academic writers produce long, theoretical books on so-called "principles," based on sketchy and unreliable fact backgrounds. Journalists are too busy to dig behind the façade. Candidates go by trial and error.

We now have the beginning of a background of fact in "Southern Politics,"* a solid book, the chief architect and author of which is Prof. V. O. Key Jr., now of Yale and formerly of Johns Hopkins. This is the best book on American politics that has appeared in many years. It marks a new approach to an old subject, and it should be of enormous value in appraising the great riddle of the South.

The research which produced this big work was conceived and carried out by the Bureau of Public Administration of the University of Alabama, with a grant of money contributed by the Rockefeller Foundation. Professor Key, as director, with a staff of field workers and statisticians, worked nearly three years on the job.

The eleven states that stretch crescentwise from Virginia to Texas form the basis of study. The book starts with a thorough analysis of politics in each of those states. Then it presents analyses of a number of political problems peculiar to the South generally, such as the nature of Southern political leadership in state politics and in Congress, the mechanism of the one-party system, the nature of the electorate, and the problem of voting under restrictions based on race.

Many venerable preconceptions about the South fall to the ground under the inexorable attack of sober facts.

The first is that the South has no real political parties. What is called a one-party system is merely an arrangement to provide protection for general Southern interests in national legislation and in national campaigns. If there were no "solid" North, there would be no "solid" South.

What we have in most of these states is a rapidly shifting and changing complex of factions and personal followings. There is nothing that suggests the attachment to principle, the cohesiveness, or the responsibility of a political party.

There are, moreover, very few authentic statewide political machines or bosses. The Virginia oligarchy of which Senator Byrd is the head is the nearest approach to a real governing party. It is aristocratic, honest, capable, economical, and responsible.

The Crump power in Tennessee is the next approach to a state machine. It has shown signs of disintegration but is still powerful. North Carolina is what the author calls a "progressive plutocracy." Its political life is marked by tolerance, official honesty, dignity, and progressive thinking.

Elsewhere (notably in Florida, where it is "every man for himself"; Alabama, where there is sharp conflict between the impoverished whites and the "big mules"; Mississippi and South Carolina, where the Negro is the major issue; Georgia, where under an antiquated constitution the "rustics" rule the cities; and Louisiana, where the unique leadership of Huey Long created the pattern) there appear personalities, good and bad, who overshadow issues of principle or party regularity. Only in Arkansas do we find pure one-party politics. Texas is sui generis. The state, with vast wealth, great spaces, negligible racial problems, and notable personal leaders, is in transition—perhaps to two-party government.

Professor Key is cautious in his predictions of the future of the political phenomenon of the Solid South. Clearly, he sees that the Negro problem is declining as a decisive factor. The growth of industry and the modernization of agriculture suggest great future changes. These, however, will only create conditions favorable to political change. The nature of such change can hardly be anticipated now.
