**PERSPECTIVE**

**Ohio and Pennsylvania**

**by Raymond Moley**

IN THE century following Lincoln's
election in 1860 Ohio has given a
majority to only a small minority of
unsuccessful candidates for President.
Consequently politicians, a superstitious
lot, have believed that "as Ohio
goes," etc. That state along with New
York has had almost a monopoly of
Presidential candidates. Indeed, in
1920, it had the candidates of both
parties. Even when the Buckeye State
has voted for a loser it has gained distinction. In 1960 Nixon received his
largest majority there.

This year the hopes of Ohio Republicans are high. Like Mr. Truman,
I have little confidence in polls or pollsters. And so in appraising Ohio before
an election I call on the judgment of a notable political leader there
who in past years has been uniformly
right in his predictions. He says this
year that State Auditor James Rhodes
will defeat Democratic Gov. Michael
V. DiSalle. Democrat Frank Lausche,
whose voting record in the Senate
shows a higher degree of conservatism
than most Republicans, will win over
an able but inexperienced John Marshall Briley. Further, Republicans will
lose one Congressional seat but gain
three. Another Taft will go to Washington, Robert Jr., as a new congressman-at-large.

**A BIG RACE**

In Pennsylvania the combination of
youth, a famous name, and hard work
should win the governorship over a
Democrat who has outlived the glamour of the reform movement in Philadelphia which supplanted an old and
corrupt Republicanism. William W.
Scranton bears no resemblance to the
old-time GOP wheelhorses. He is personable on the stump, has immense
support in eastern Pennsylvania, and
elicits enthusiasm everywhere. Richardson Dilworth, mayor of Philadelphia, has passed his prime, has had
scandals in his administration to contend with, and has been engaged in a
prolonged row with Philadelphia's
Democratic boss, Congressman William J. Green Jr. In this the angels may
be on Dilworth's side. But angels have
no votes and bosses have no wings.
This hurts Dilworth. Moreover, Dilworth as a campaigner is shy and cool
at close quarters but emotional and intemperate in addressing crowds.
Philadelphia, as with the man in the
Scriptures, seems to have cast out Republican devils only to witness Democratic devils moving in.

Gov. David Lawrence as longtime
leader in Pittsburgh built an efficient
machine, and in Harrisburg has created another-statewide. Both have
deteriorated. It is ironic that the two
bright reformers, Clark and Dilworth,
are now heavily dependent upon powerful machines themselves.

**DEMOCRATIC TROUBLES**

The President came to the state to
help his faltering party, but it was
evident when he made joint appearances with Dilworth, Lawrence, and
Sen. Joseph S. Clark, who is running
for re-election, that the crowds came,
as an Ohio politician once said, "to listen to another and not someone else."

What is most important, Republicans in Pennsylvania are hard at work
in practically complete harmony. They
will have more polling places manned
in Philadelphia than ever before since
the great days of the Republican
bosses. While labor's political arms
have in the past done effective work in
Pennsylvania and are there again this
year in support of the Democratic
candidates, their arguments are not
realistic. Unemployment is still depressing many areas. And those who
toil not and neither do they earn are
reflecting on the fact that a Democrat
has been in the White House for
22 months and in the governor's office
for eight years. For them "the harvest
is past, the summer is ended, and we
are not saved."

Scranton attracts many labor votes.
He won his Congressional seat two
years ago in a heavily Democratic district in which the bulk of the vote
also went to Mr. Kennedy. Pennsylvanians have a vote-splitting habit.

All this, I wish to emphasize, is as
things stand several days before election. In judging such appraisals I suggest that anything can happen in
politics. But of one everlasting fact
there is no change. Reform movements
wither. Promises wing their way back
like the raven to haunt those who
made them. And voters ask, as Alben
Barkley once said: "What have you
done for me lately?"
