**Washington Turns Right**

by Raymond Moley

SEATTLE, WASH.—The Senatorial career of the redoubtable Warren G. Magnuson may be drawing to a close. He was an authentic product of New Dealism. He entered public life—and public jobs have occupied him almost continuously during his adult years—in the depth of the depression, served through various local jobs, was elected to the House of Representatives in the great Roosevelt sweep of 1936, and remained there until elevated to the Senate in 1944. These successive victories were to a large degree because he was marching ideologically in the spirit of the great wave of welfarism that inundated this state, and in part because he has had weak opposition. Both of these advantages have vanished. The state, now humming with prosperity, is turning to the right, and Magnuson’s opponent is a formidable threat.

**REMARKABLE GROWTH**

Gov. Arthur Langlie is, to say the least, outstanding among the nation’s Republican leaders. In the past eight years, during which I have had frequent contacts with him, he has grown in stature to a remarkable extent. No better choice could have been made by the Republican Party for the national convention keynoter in August. Indeed, if his speech on that occasion is of the same quality as the one he delivered at the Republican state convention here, the Eisenhower campaign will be off to a fine start. Langlie was elected governor in 1940, 1948, and 1952 for an unprecedented three terms. It is notable that in the first two of those elections he carried the state against a Democratic tide. He found when he re-entered office in 1949 a state government rolling in a sea of financial excesses. His predecessor, the absurd Mon Wallgren, had permitted the itch for public handouts to reach an acute stage. Washington in those years was the nation’s outstanding example of state socialism operating under a republican form of government. What with pensions, socialized medicine, and other welfare items, during Langlie’s second term the state treasury was practically bankrupt. Without severe cutbacks, Langlie succeeded in rationalizing confusion. Washington with its great water-power resources was a predominantly public-power state. He vigorously and successfully opposed the huge Roosevelt-Ickes scheme for a Columbia Valley Authority. He has since been a strong supporter of the President’s partnership policy in generating power and a strong opponent of the Morse plan for a Federal dam at Hells Canyon. The state is, in fact, turning away from public power.

Magnuson, despite the fact that he has outlived the public mood for radicalism, will be hard to beat. He is much more discreet in his utterances than is his neighbor, Senator Morse. His indefatigable attentions to the small amenities have all but won over many businessmen. His voting record has, however, been straight down the liberal Democratic line. It very closely parallels that of Senators Morse and Neuberger.

On the other hand, the Republican Party in the state has taken a conservative stand on most current issues. In the state platform adopted at the recent convention it called for the protection of the American workingman “whether he be a union or nonunion member.” It endorsed the principle of the Bricker amendment, and favored the support of public schools by local communities.

**BRIGHT PROSPECTS**

The drive of the state toward conservatism is explained by an amazing growth in well-being. It is true that the present boom was probably initiated by great sums of Federal money flowing in for the great dams on the rivers, the aircraft industry, the atomic installations at Hanford, and the Navy Yard at Bremerton. But a growing population, a third of which has come in since the war, is enough in itself to generate a flourishing economy. Moreover, the imposition of a high sales tax has relieved the financial difficulties of the state government. It would be foolish to predict the outcome of the Magnuson-Langlie contest, but it seems clear that the prospects for the Republican Party to pick up a much-needed seat in the United States Senate are fairly bright.
