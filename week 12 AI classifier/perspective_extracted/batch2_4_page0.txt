**THE ESTABLISHMENT**

BY RAYMOND MOLEY

A good word which has an understandable and honorable traditional use is "establishment." Let us hope that its current use will be sufficiently rational that it will escape the distortions which have been inflicted upon other good words such as "liberal," "progressive" and "conservative," which for purposes of politics or propaganda have been violently wrenched from their traditional meaning.

In the dictionary, an establishment, among other applications, means a sort of system of ideas, especially applied to a religious or church belief or a "rule, decree, law or code of laws."

The exceedingly articulate editor of *The Indianapolis News*, M. Stanton Evans, says: "The outline of something in which a cluster of influential people are working in the same direction becomes easily discernible." That "something" he describes as the "Establishment."

The word is more specifically defined by the use of adjectives such as "liberal" or "Eastern." The former is used by Evans in the title of his book, "The Liberal Establishment."


**THE COLONIAL DIVISION**

Vermont Royster in a perceptive article in *The Wall Street Journal* supports the current use of the term, saying: "Probably the most close-knit Establishment in our own history was the one that got the country started." The agreement then was on a simple proposition, independence from Britain. The bitter split among the influential people who sustained the revolution took place after the revolution was won.

That division, which began in the 1780s, interestingly enough centered upon the question that concerns us today—the extent of authority which the Federal government should be allowed to exercise. Political parties, which alternately won supremacy for many years, were built on this issue. The danger today is that in a hasty desire to separate the right from the wrong people we oversimplify and exaggerate.

Not everyone who believes in a social-security system perforce would favor providing Federal money to run city bus lines or medicare. Nor should everyone who opposes the abolition of literacy voting tests be labeled an extremist.

The peril in ideological struggle is that individuals, no matter how selective their choices of policy may be, are lumped willy-nilly into one of two establishments. That, unfortunately, was the tragedy of the 1964 Presidential campaign.


**ROMNEY'S "THRUST"**

In describing what he believes to be the necessity for two political parties, Gov. George Romney in a television interview used a word which might have come from the engineering language he knew when he was building Ramblers—the word "thrust." He explained that the "thrust" of the Republican Party should be away from excessive Federal power. By implication he charged the Johnsonian Democrats as "thrusting" toward a completely centralized state.

That is a viable distinction between two great national parties, and one which the man in the street can understand.

In suggesting his allegiance to an anti-Federalist "thrust," Romney anticipated the opposition's major argument. He pointed out that with better government the states can solve most of their own problems without an excess of Federal help. He is providing better government, he says, for Michigan.

That, as I have so often pointed out, is the real way to slow down the tide toward super-centralization which is now rising so rapidly. The trend of argument should not be doctrinaire. It should be practical. Many who carelessly accept the fiction that schools, hospitals, housing, transportation are inadequate ipso facto, hold that they must therefore be subsidized from Washington. Thus, they align themselves with a completely identifiable establishment. Good government and a more productive and comfortable civilization depend upon selectivity among issues. The doctrinaire individual is the real enemy of any society. The way to progress is to seek means while at the same time we keep ends in the back of our minds. This is the way to a more enjoyable society.
