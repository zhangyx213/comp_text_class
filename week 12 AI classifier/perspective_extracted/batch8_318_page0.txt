**Perspective**

**Tale Spinning**

The distinguished judges of the
O.Henry Memorial Award have just given
the first prize for the year to Stephen
Vincent Benét for his superb modern vari-
ant of the traditional tall tale, "The Devil
and Daniel Webster." They will be ignor-
ing their obvious duty if they fail, next
year, to award it to an even more superla-
tive specimen of the same genre—the tall
tale that the current downward trend in
business and security prices is the result
of a "plot" to discredit the New Deal.

This yarn has taken the country by
storm in the past two weeks. When I left
the industrial East it was ringing in my
ears. I heard it in the Middle West—in
Cleveland and Chicago. It was my first
greeting when I got off the train in Cali-
fornia. And, within the fortnight, the story
was twice given indirect official encourage-
ment—once when the FTC was asked to
find out whether monopolistic business
practices were responsible for the exces-
sively high prices which contributed to the
slump and again when the SEC sought to
pin the responsibility for market condi-
tions on the Stock Exchange.

The basic elements in a Baron Munchau-
sen story, the textbooks tell us, are wild
implausibility, extravagant humor and
complete absurdity. My candidate for the
prize of the year meets all tests. On the
score of humor, it assumes that there is a
community of interest among businessmen
generally and between businessmen and
financiers; that Mr. Ford and Mr. Sloan,
for example, are not competitors, and that
the interests of Mr. Sheaffer, manufacturer
of fountain pens in Iowa, coincide with
those of Lazard Frères, international bank-
ers.

On the score of implausibility, it im-
plies that those whose chief characteristic
is selfishness—or so we have been told
during the past four years—have forgot-
ten their own interests to the extent of
sacrificing some thirty billion dollars of
their security values for the sake of em-
barrassing a President whose policies they
disapprove. It supposes that businessmen
are delighted that industrial output will,
by this month, have fallen 25 per cent
since March. It pictures the steelmen en-
chanted by the news that their plants are
operating at 31 per cent of capacity—the
lowest point since December 1934; ma-
chine-tool men crowing over indexes show-
ing a 27.8 per cent drop in orders since
September; railroad men glorying in re-
ports that freight-car loadings are off 17
per cent since the last week in September;
and automobile manufacturers dancing on
the streets of Detroit because current sales
warranted the production of 21,700 cars
less in the week ended November 27 than
the previous week.

On the score of absurdity, the tale as-
sumes lack of political foresight so com-
plete that any amateur could recognize it.
A depression now, unless it is a major de-
pression, will end by next summer, and
things will be on the upgrade by autumn.
This will give the Democrats an advan-
tage in Congressional elections, with re-
sults which will probably be interpreted as
a Roosevelt mandate for continued reform
and a third-term candidacy. If business-
men could or would cause a depression,
then, would they not have saved it for
the summer of 1938 or for 1940?

The "conspiracy" story also assumes the
absence of any more likely explanation for
the recession. It asks us to disregard the
overbuying in anticipation of labor diffi-
culties and rising costs which character-
ized the first half of 1937. We must forget
all statistical indications that the margin
of business profit was steadily decreasing
in the year to July 1, 1931. We must close
our eyes to the fact that reduced volume
of sales follows materially increased prices
as inevitably as night follows day. We
must believe that nothing the Adminis-
tration has said or done has made the
investor, big or small, shrink from long-
time risks.

In the absence of proof that one solitary
businessman, banker or broker voluntarily
courted bankruptcy by reason of his
hatred for the Administration, I believe
that this newest addition to the national
folklore stands head and shoulders over
the story of Daniel Webster's outtalking
the devil. Always providing, of course, that
it's tall tales the O.Henry judges are after,
next year.

**Wages and Hours**

Changes have come over the face of
things since the Black-Connery Bill for
the regulation of wages and hours was in-
troduced last spring. The A.F. of L. has
withdrawn its support. Organized agricul-
ture has been fighting quietly, but effec-
tively, against the bill. Mr. Connery is
dead. Mr. Black has been elevated. Con-
gress is reasserting its prerogatives. And
business is suffering a recession unique in
its velocity. All this means that no wages
and hours legislation, regardless of its

NEWSWEEK

form, is likely to emerge from the special
session.

Yet it seems to me that we ought not
postpone the experimental stages of Fed-
eral regulation of wages and hours indefi-
nitely. While it is true that we may further
discourage the investing spirit by setting
up the elaborate machinery blueprinted in
the original bill, nevertheless it is also true
that to do nothing at all will simply build
up pressure for dangerously ambitious and
extreme forms of regulation. Between the
extremes of laissez faire and bureaucratic
control is a wide ground into which we
have already entered irrevocably. The
question is not "shall we enter," but "how"
and "when" shall we adventure further.

The logical starting point is regulation
of those wages which everybody concedes
are substandard. Not all industries and
not all regions have these abnormally low
rates. But to correct or eliminate the
small percentage which exists would be a
sizable step forward, reassuring the re-
mainder of employers and wage earners
that they would never be undercut by
wages below a certain point.

Let us admit, before we begin, of course,
that the people whose wages are declared
substandard will not necessarily get higher
pay for the jobs they are doing, or quickly
find other work in the same or in any other
industry. The chances are pretty good that
the government will have to undertake the
permanent support of the great majority
of them, who will be unable to find work
anywhere at standard wages. That we must
frankly face as the cost of such legislation.

We must recognize, too, that a wages and
hours bill will inevitably bear more heavily
upon the South than upon the North,
whether or not it provides for differentials
by region. And it will just as inevitably
cause upheavals in the economy of the
nation as a whole. Obsolescent lines of in-
dustry will be speeded to oblivion. Infant
industries which cannot make the grade
will be discouraged. Some processors of the
older commodities will be forced to go out
of business and make way for the manu-
facturers of higher-priced substitutes for
natural products. Yet if the wage stand-
ards set by law are not so high to begin
with that they throw an unbearable bur-
den of social readjustment upon an already
badly strained government, then we may
make a useful beginning in conserving our
human resources.

No doubt we ought to put out the blaze
that is licking at our industrial house be-
fore we sit down and plan to add new
wings to the threatened premises. This
means that Congress is justified in recog-
nizing that tax relief, housing aid and
utility peace should come ahead of wages
and hours legislation at the moment. But
it certainly does not mean that the desire
for innovation is so weak that we will be
able to ignore it when we have dealt with
more pressing demands.
