**Meaningless Report**

by Raymond Moley

LAST week in this space I described some of the insinuations and misrepresentations in the report on 1956 campaign contributions and expenditures prepared by Sen. Albert Gore’s subcommittee on Privileges and Elections. Now let us see what the report has to offer on the subject of the contributions and expenditures of politically inclined unions.

The figures are sketchy and their presentation clumsy. Either the subcommittee was overwhelmed by the volume of what they collected, or they were anxious to minimize the help given by the unions to the Democrats. The net result is meaningless and incomplete.

The report fails to make clear what a political expenditure really means. The unions decided for themselves what was “political” and what was “education.” The smaller part of union activity in politics is supported by “voluntary” contributions by members, while the larger part, called “education,” is paid out of union funds.

**MANY SOURCES**

In the general table in the report listing direct campaign expenditures, “labor” is down for $941,271. Later in the report there are listed “transfers” from “national labor groups” to labor campaign committees, Democratic candidates for the House and Senate, Democratic Party committees, and other labor or Democratic committees, totaling $1,209,560. This amount was buried in the expenditures of the Democrats or of the labor organizations. Another tabulation appears for expenditures of “state and local labor groups.” These come to $830,344, half of which they spent directly, and half of which they transferred to other labor and Democratic committees and candidates. Thus it would seem that labor groups raised and spent, from “voluntary sources,” $2,981,175. Another tabulation lists the receipts from specific unions. This shows that about 80 per cent came from the United Auto Workers, the Steelworkers, the Ladies Garment Workers, and Railway Labor’s Political League. Note that this covers only national, not local contributions.

But the report also shows that a very considerable number of labor or-ganizations did not comply with the subcommittee’s request for information. Hence the figures cited above are far below even the actual “voluntary” contributions and expenditures. Also, it should be noted that contributions for the most part are limited to the three months from Sept. 1 to Nov. 30. Traditionally, that is the season when the contributors to the Republican Party give birth to the heaviest contributions. Political labor organizations are year-round affairs.

**A WIDE FIELD**

Enormous funds are spent for what are actually political purposes out of union treasuries. Representatives of the unions cited the following activities which they consider they are permitted to support out of general union funds: “(1) Systematically organized drives for registration of voters; (2) carry out a systematic program of political education, including organization of schools where political questions are discussed, and the compilation and distribution of voting records; and (3) exercise the right of free speech by expressing their views on political questions in print and by means of radio and television and otherwise.” Since such drives for registrations are limited to those whose minds are prepared by the “educational methods” described, these three activities cover about all that is ordinarily meant by politics. Altogether, it is a fair guess that the total of contributions by the unions to the Democrats is greater than that contributed by Democrats as such. This means that in many of the Northern and Western states the unions actually dominate the Democratic Party.

Finally, there is invaluable manpower furnished by paid union officers, shop stewards, and others. This contribution cannot be evaluated in monetary terms, but it is very great. It was stated in the publication Labor’s Daily last year that “the expenditure of manpower… is the real power of the UAW in the political arena.”

It is not only in what the subcommittee’s report admits, but in what it conspicuously omits that there are portrayed the dimensions of political power which may well dominate the political life of a nation.
