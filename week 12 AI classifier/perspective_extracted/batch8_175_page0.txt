**Perspective**

**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

**Political Tides**

The most valiant believers in
Roosevelt's political invincibility are his
fiercest political critics. The third-term advocates
holding jobs in Washington sometimes have
doubts, first, about his running, and, second,
about his winning. But never the die-hard
conservatives in the East. They're positive
that Roosevelt will be renominated and
reelected.

Firsthand observation of the country and
analysis of news from the Middle West leave
professional followers of political trends with no
such certainty. They're trying to reckon with a
steadily increasing resentment over corn prices, a
number of bitter factional fights that threaten to
shift states to the Republican camp and like
factors with which the parlor experts can't be
bothered.

Since the primaries in Wisconsin, Illinois and
Nebraska, Dr. Gallup has published the results of
a simple poll on party preferences in these states.
In Illinois and Wisconsin, 55 per cent favor the
Republicans; in Nebraska, 51 per cent. This is a
shift from 59 per cent Democratic preference in
1936 in Illinois, 68 per cent in Wisconsin, and 58
per cent in Nebraska. It's a very great shift. An
election preview in all the states, just published by
Gallup, shows that a sinking in Democratic
strength from the high 1936 level is general. The
Democrats are still ahead in 31 states, but the
Democratic lead in some states is so slim that a
further shift of only 1 per cent would throw a
majority of electoral votes to the GOP.

The question is whether Roosevelt, running for a
third term, would be stronger or weaker than his
party. The journalistic stooges of the Administration
say stronger. Such evidence as we have contradicts
that. Ten days ago Gallup published a poll indicating
that, in trial heats, Roosevelt could poll 53 per cent
of the vote against Vandenberg, while Hull could
poll 58 per cent of the vote against Vandenberg.
Meanwhile, Vandenberg has been through two actual
primaries against Dewey, and his defeat by Dewey
was vastly greater than his defeat in the poll by
either Roosevelt or Hull. Recently, The Cleveland
Press took a poll showing that Roosevelt, as a
third-term candidate, would get 53.6 per cent of the
vote. In 1936 he got 65.7 per cent of the vote. In
every poll taken so far, the vote approving Roosevelt
generally runs well over the vote for him as a
third-term candidate.


The fact that Eastern financial circles consider
Roosevelt unbeatable, regardless, suggests an
interesting political paradox. Suppose Roosevelt's
nomination in July. Suppose investors feel so
surely he will be elected that they express their
pessimism by a pulling in of horns, a fear of new
commitments, a reluctance to risk savings. In all
probability, then, the economic curve turns
downward. As always in politics, the party in
power is punished for bad times. It's not
impossible that Roosevelt might be beaten because
of the very conviction that he can't be beaten.

**An Expensive Bargain**

The President's new relief request suggests the
technique of the bargain counter. Good
merchandisers know all about the pulling power of
the 98-cent article as against the $1 article. The
sum of $975,000,000 is what the President asks
to spend for WPA. Think of how nice to say in the
campaign: "WPA? Oh yes! We're spending less
than a billion this year."

Last January the President sent Congress a budget
for the fiscal year beginning next July. It proposed
to spend for relief and WPA a total of
$1,247,700,000. This was a reduction from the
$1,809,923,000 estimated at that time as likely to
be spent in the current fiscal year—the year ending
next June 30. But it was still over a billion dollars.

Now, the President has proposed that $975,000,000
requested for WPA be spent in eight months, if
necessary. The point, obviously, is that, distributed
in eight months, $975,000,000 comes to a little
more by the month than the amount proposed last
winter, though it continues to look like a reduction.

The fiscal year, as everyone knows, is named for the
year in which it ends, on June 30. For every fiscal
year which has had an uneven number, beginning
with 1935, the Federal expenditure for relief has
been larger than it was the year preceding. Thus, in
years ending June 30, the expenditures were larger
for 1935, 1937 and 1939 than they were for the fiscal
years that had even numbers. What is the key to this
strange pulsation? Is it an economic cycle or a
political cycle? Could it have any relation to the fact
that each odd fiscal year contains a national election?

Congress is still working on the budget for the fiscal
year 1941. It is an uneven number year—an election
year. Superficially, it appears that Congress is being
asked to appropriate less than it did a year ago.
Actually, the WPA appropriation may all be spent in
two-thirds of the coming fiscal year. The new
Congress may have to appropriate more money
directly after it meets. And the final total for the
year may well be higher than it was this year. If the
Democrats are returned, this President or some other
Democrat can, with impunity, ask for whatever he
wants. If the Republicans win, Democrats can gleefully
witness their embarrassment as they ask for new
funds.

If anything could possibly illustrate the necessity for
a complete new deal in relief, these simple facts
should suffice.


**Antidotes to Pessimism**

For us Americans there could be few better
antidotes to pessimism at this moment than two
magnificent books just published. One is a warning,
and the other, a promise. One is the study of the
progress of a mortal politico-economic disease, and
the other, a study of our political economy's capacity
for resisting it.

The first, Robert Hunter's "Revolution," is the work
of a man who has pondered social movements for
forty years. He was once a Socialist, a settlement
worker and student of revolutionary movements. He
tells of why men revolt, of the cycles through which
revolutions move, of the technique of revolution and
of the structural changes in a society that precede
revolution. The stigmata of decay, he says, are
excessive taxation, the abolition of debts, devaluation,
inflation and outright confiscation. Always these
related infections of the body politic are accompanied
by a raging fever of increased governmental power.
Hunter concludes: "Those who believe that a
continuous increase in the power of the State is the
only remedy for our problems are masking their
movements when they denounce Stalin, Hitler and
Mussolini. They are all traveling with varying
degrees of speed toward the same goal."

The second book, Carl Snyder's "Capitalism the
Creator," charts the extent to which our particular
form of economy has contributed to the position of the
United States. There is, he says, "one way, and only
one way, that any people, in all history, have ever
risen from barbarism and poverty to affluence and
culture; and that is by that concentrated and highly
organized system of production and exchange which we
call Capitalistic..." Capital savings "alone" have
"created... our modern world of comfort, convenience
and luxury beside." In one of the most lucid books on
economics ever written, Mr. Snyder demonstrates the
origins, the strength and the potentialities of our
economic way of life. To protect it is to heed the
warnings of Mr. Hunter about the subtle processes by
which democracy is undermined.
