**New Federal Power Policy**

**by Raymond Moley**

BOISE, IDAHO—Two years ago, during a visit to this state, I wrote for this space a piece about the controversy over the proposal of the Federal government to build a monstrous dam on the Snake River at Hell’s Canyon. I noted the objections to the project by responsible public officials and organizations and the attractive alternative proposal of the Idaho Power Co. to build with private money a series of smaller dams.

A lot of water has gone down the Snake since then, but none of it over even the shadow of a dam. Official Idaho has stood firmly against the Federal proposal, Congress has not authorized it, and all the Truman Administration was able to do was to block the Idaho Power Co.’s plans in the Federal Power Commission.

But meanwhile there has been an election and a new Administration which, through Secretary McKay, has withdrawn the opposition of the Interior Department to the private company’s plans. The plans are now being presented to the Federal Power Commission in hearings which will probably continue for some weeks.

The Administration took a second and much less publicized step with the requests for appropriations for the Army Corps of Engineers, covering rivers, harbors, flood control, and hydroelectric power. The Bureau of the Budget, acting, of course, for the President, stated that it would approve of no requests except those which were “clearly essential in terms of the objectives of the Administration.” Those objectives are to curtail the power program of the Federal government and to invite greater participation by the states, local districts, and private companies.

The appropriations committees of both houses most enthusiastically seconded that policy, cutting even below the requests of the Administration. The bills passed in both houses substantially as written.

There was, of course, wailing and gnashing of teeth by public-power senators. The arguments were the old ones—a great power shortage in the Northwest and the evils of private power companies.

However, a number of solid facts have appeared which to a greater and greater degree are impressing themselves upon reasonable people.

The need of the Northwest for electric power because of its lack of coal and oil has not been neglected by Congress. In the bill as passed by the Senate for the Army Engineers, $176,000,000 of the total of about $450,000,000 for the entire nation were devoted to power projects in Washington and Oregon alone.

Moreover, it is becoming apparent that rising costs and more difficult sites for development have thrown a grave doubt upon the earlier assumption that, because falling water is a free gift of nature, the electric power derived therefrom is relatively cheap. There has been ample evidence that the quickest way to meet a power shortage is certainly not through the tortuous process of Federal appropriations and construction.

There is also a growing opposition to high dams by many perfectly legitimate interests such as farmers desperately anxious about their water rights, the fishing and lumbering industries, and lovers of recreation and wild life. There is evidence that there is greater engineering efficiency in lower dams. Also important is the resentment of older manufacturing regions, such as New England, over the efforts of government to draw industries away from them by cheap subsidized power.

THERE is a bald inconsistency in the appeals of the advocates of socialized power, because in one breath they claim the virtues of bringing new private industries into a region by giving them below-cost power, while they denounce the private power companies. Are we to believe that private people engaged in selling electricity are all bad, while people selling other things are all good? Such a subsidy to favored industries is as unfair as were the fat preferences given by the tariff in days of old.

Such considerations no doubt weigh heavily in these days of crushing taxation and vast Federal expenditures, and this Administration has had the courage to recognize their validity.
