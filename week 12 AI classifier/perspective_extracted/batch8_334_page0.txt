**TODAY IN AMERICA**
**By Raymond Moley**

**Whoso Diggeth a Pit**

I DID my best to mince no words when
I discussed the fitness of Hugo Black
for a place on the Supreme Bench five
weeks ago. The quality of the man has,
for years, been no secret, and the blaz-
ing news of the past ten days has
simply thrown into deeper relief de-
fects which were common knowledge.
But now, as when he was appointed,
Black himself is less important than
the bent of Administration policy which
prompted, even permitted, his elevation
to high judicial office. Liberal and
moderate supporters of the President
have always regarded his attitude to-
ward Black as a barometer of his polit-
ical mood, and, as his early attitude of
aloofness toward Black changed to tol-
erance and then to whole-hearted en-
dorsement, their amazement and
consternation reached a climax. For
Black has, for two years, been a sym-
bol of that second New Deal which is
called by its friends "a war for the
greatest stake in political history—the
control of the wealth and energies of
125,000,000 Americans." Black repre-
sents class hatreds. He stands for the
attempt to trample in the dust the
ideal of amicable, gradual readjust-
ment among the diverse interests of
our society. In short, he is a bigot.
No reasonable interpretation of
Black's appointment can omit the fact
that the President, in the haste and
anger that accompanied that act, was
determined to do three things: defy
his moderate supporters, consecrate
class antagonism and balance an in-
tolerant reactionary minority on the
Court with an even more intensely
radical minority. Black's appointment
was not the product of a policy de-
signed to build a united nation; it was
an expression of the tactic of division.
And "whoso diggeth a pit shall fall
therein: and he that rolleth a stone, it
will return upon him."
The bitterest critics of the Court's
economic predilections have not chal-
lenged the Court's record in the field
of civil liberties. Its decisions in the
Scottsboro, Herndon, Mooney, de Jonge
and Grosjean cases, to mention only a
conspicuous few of recent years, stem
from a liberal tradition of whose mean-
ing Black has never had and cannot
now have any conception. His record
has been a repudiation of that tradi-
tion. And to say, as some pseudo-lib-
erals say, that Black's record on social
and economic legislation overshadows


his record on civil and religious tolera-
tion is to reverse the order of things.
Humane legislation is the child, not the
father, of civil and religious liberty.
The very stone images of Washing-
ton, Jefferson and Lincoln on Mount
Rushmore must rumble with titanic
laughter at the "embarrassment" of
the High Command in the past ten
days. For it springs not from the rev-
elation that Black is a fomenter of class
hatreds. No, indeed! It springs from the
realization that Black is a political li-
ability.
Religious intolerance is unpopular
these days. But economic night riding
still gets votes.

**A Minatory Finger**

T
HE nation is emerging from the fogs
of the depression. The old customs
of economic life reappear. Once again
our political and economic scouts are
projecting a course for the country to
follow. Can the idea of free enterprise
ever again dominate our economy? Has
the machine created a new world to
which the old liberalism is not appli-
cable? Is collectivism our destiny and
dictatorship its prophet?
These are grave questions, and it is
well that there are thinking men who
momentarily ignore the next year and
look to the next generation. Walter
Lippmann has aspired to this service
in his new book "The Good Society"
(Little, Brown & Co., Boston). Mr.
Lippmann intelligently demonstrates
the ultimate folly of such alternatives
to liberalism as communism and fas-
cism. He confesses the failure of lib-
eralism to deliver fully on its promise
of human improvement. He suggests
in shadowy outline the course he be-
lieves liberalism must take in order to
recover its earlier hold on the faith of
the people.
I find myself unable to share most of
his grave apprehensions about the ex-
tension of the field of public action
since 1933. I cannot see that the gen-
erally cautious steps we have taken to
purify the competitive system and to
establish in it those minima of eco-
nomic order indispensable to the sur-
vival of individual initiative are in
themselves steps toward an ultimate
collectivism. Nor do I believe with Mr.
Lippmann that the atomistic competi-
tive society—the society of 40-acre
farmers, selectmen, fence viewers and
hog reeves, as Professor Beard called
it—is the sine qua non of democracy.
But I rejoice that, at a moment when

every fourth assistant counsel in every
Washington bureau is glibly chattering
the jargon of national planning, Mr.
Lippmann has raised a minatory finger
—firm and steady.

**The HEP-SEPs'll Git You**

I
T WAS just at bedtime and I was
pretty sleepy and so I didn't hear the
whole story. All I remember is that it
was a wowser and I wished I could
think out how the mystery could be
solved. We might call it "The Presi-
dent's Second Mystery Story" because,
like the first one that was printed in a
magazine a while back, it left it up to
everybody to guess how it came out.
Well, the other night it went like this:
There was a great, big crisis all over
the country and a terrible lot of fear
made by a dead historian named Lord
Mac-something. And there was a dread-
ful man who was called the Thin Man—
no, the Odd Man—who was all the time
running back and forth, never getting
anywhere except the place he turned
around in. And there was a dreadful
fog made by lawyers like those who
made—no, who didn't make—the Con-
stitution. And running around in the fog
were a lot of big, bad people—some of
them cold-blooded and some, reckless.
The first wanted to Hold Power and
the others to Seize Power.
It was awfully hard to follow the
story at that place because the man
who was telling it didn't give these bad
people really, truly names. (I guess
when you give really, truly names, bad
people always interrupt your story to
talk back.) So to make it easy to fol-
low, I had to make up names from
initials like they do in Washington; the
"HPs" for the "Hold Powers" and the
"SPs" for the "Seize Powers." And so
Joe Guffey could pronounce these in his
speeches against bad Senators, I put in
a couple of "E's" and called them all
"HEP-SEPS."
A man named Dodd who is our Am-
bassador or something in Germany
once talked about HEP-SEPs too, only
he didn't name them that. He said two
or three people whose names he didn't
tell told him there were HEPS-SEPS
in America, but that they didn't know
who they were.
But really it was all mixed up. I
didn't hear the whole story. When I
heard the speaker begin to talk about
tolerance, though, I knew everything
was all right, because what I really
wanted to know was if he was going to
protect us against people who join
secret societies that scare innocent
people and wear nightshirts, as well as
against HEP-SEPs who can't be named
because they are so bad. So, as I
say, when he said he was for tolerance,
I knew he was sorry about Hugo
Black's being on the Supreme Court,
and I fell asleep.
