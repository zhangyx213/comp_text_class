**Perspective**

**Government by Delusion**

Next week the people of two great states, California and Ohio, are facing a vital test of representative government at the polls. They are voting, in California, on Ham-and-Eggs and, in Ohio, on the Bigelow scheme. Both plans are expressions of the same economic philosophy—the belief that government spending can create prosperity. Both spell out this false premise in fantastic political and economic terms (see page 25). Both promise misguided people benefits which cannot conceivably be achieved. Both, if passed, would bankrupt their states.

But wholly aside from all this, both are attempts to stuff into constitutions things which simply have no proper place in constitutions. Imagine an amendment to the constitution of California that provides not only for a new system of monetary exchange differing from the national monetary system, not only for a bank scheme that threatens the financial structure of the state, but that also specifies, by name, the administrator of the scheme. The first of the Bigelow amendments in Ohio is likewise crammed with such fantastic detail. More, the Rev. Herbert Bigelow offers another amendment to reduce the number of petitioners needed to initiate constitutional amendments—a proposal clearly designed to smooth the path of newer and later schemes of the Bigelow brew.

Government can give us not even the vestiges of security and stability if constitutions are permitted to become the kind of playthings the Bigelow and Ham-and-Eggs champions would make of them. It is bad enough that such movements as these periodically put delusive economic schemes before the voters at elections conducted at great expense to the taxpayers. It is worse that the amendment process is being abused to embody the sanction for raids upon state treasuries in state constitutions themselves.

Year by year, as the notion grows that prosperity can be legislated by spreading money "like manure" (so Herbert Bigelow is reported to have put it), the fight against these raids grows harder. The recent history of California, with its roster of political mortalities, begins to suggest that pussy-footing is the one assurance of political survival. It must have been some such reflection as this that led Secretary Wallace, a day after his third-term-for-Roosevelt outbreak, to speak of pressure groups as "a component part of democracy."

From the time when an indecisive party leadership in Washington failed to take a stand on the candidacy of Upton Sinclair, to Mr. Wallace's pronouncement, there has been no evidence that the Administration is much concerned with anything that will check the tendency toward government by delusion. Yet the issue is more than a fight against economic chaos. It is a fight against the disintegration of constitutional government.

**Off-Balance**

Styles change in economic planning, but the idea of balance between agriculture and industry is one of the most durable of all our philosophical goods. It emerges again, not unexpectedly, because of the violent wrench the war in Europe has given some of our price relationships in this country. We suddenly discover that the world cannot take many of our agricultural surpluses but is frantic to get our steel and metal products. Foreigners—mostly neutrals—are said to be bidding three to four dollars extra for steel per ton.

Those who believe in keeping prices in balance are alarmed. They fear that the uprush of certain prices will set them back years from their goal. Fully as disturbing is the possibility that something very much resembling recovery may be achieved with an even greater disequilibrium of prices, by their way of thinking, than has ever existed before. But no particularly intelligible remedies seem to have been suggested, to date.

A few weeks ago Secretary of Commerce Hopkins blamed businessmen for buying certain goods in too sudden volume. The demand for goods, he implied, was coming from businessmen who had false ideas of Europe's capacity to take our wares. In short, the demand side of business caught a little measured hell.

Just before this, several Administration officials hinted that price increases in the making because of increased demand would force the Administration to exercise price controls. And so the supply side of business was threatened with a little larruping.

What, in the circumstances, is the duty of the American producer, say the American steel producer? If customers are demanding too much steel, how does he check the demand? He has always relied upon the price system to do that kind of checking. But he can't raise his price because the government will step in with price regulations to maintain a "balance" if he does. Should he then pro-rate his customers or put them on quotas? If he does that, the Department of Justice will no doubt start after him. So, coming or going, he's apt to get socked.

Perhaps as he ponders his dilemma he'll be tempted to ask: "What is this 'balance' which the Administration's intent on achieving?" The answer is that it's a hypothetical state of things that didn't exist in the past war, and that couldn't exist for long in the present war even if the power of a Federal government decreed it and struggled to maintain it. Which is comfort, but pretty cold comfort, to those who are going to have to conduct their businesses while the balancing act is attempted.


**Spend-Lend Goes to War**

Every year, with the first nip of frost, the spend-lend boys in Washington begin to rake the leaves of new and old schemes to load the budget. Lines to the "Skipper" grow hot.

This year the schemes are apparently to be painted with military camouflage. One of the reporters who generally knows what the spend-lend boys are doing reports in The New York Post that "tentative" plans are under way for:

"(1) Super-highways strategically situated for troop and supply movements.
"(2) New railroad equipment to assure adequate military transportation facilities.
"(3) Emergency airports useful for civil aviation but easily convertible into military fields.
"(4) Hospitals to assure better medical care for civilians in peacetime and adequate facilities for the Army and Navy in wartime.
"(5) Low-cost housing on the outskirts of cities that might become cantonments for new streamlined divisions serving as defense units.
"(6) Made-work projects of the WPA variety but producing bandages, hospital supplies and clothing for war use."

All of which is the same old bunch of projects of which we heard six months ago. But now they have on war paint. Why not add the shelter-belt project and alibi it on the ground that troops need it to practice Indian warfare amidst the trees? Why not revive Passamaquoddy to generate power to shoot rockets to Germany?

War and politics make strange bedfellows, but both provide excuses for unbalanced budgets, it seems.
