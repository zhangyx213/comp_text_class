**4-Uncontrolled Government**

WHEN we read in the successive
reports of the Hoover commission
about the incredible waste, confusion,
and duplication of functions in our
Federal government, two questions
will come to our minds. Why has all
this not been made known before?
Isn't there a government agency that
can do something about it?

A large part of the answer
lies in the tragic story of the
Comptroller General's Gen-
eral Accounting Office. That
office as originally conceived
might have been a continu-
ous Hoover commission.
And it might, if it had not
fallen victim to the virus of
bureaucracy, have remedied
or prevented many of those
malignant defects in our government.

It will not profit us to scream at
Congress and the President to correct
this or that item of waste. Before the
dredging starts, Congress and the
President must repair their tools-the
Budget Bureau and the Comptroller
General's office. This job cannot be
done with the pick-and-shovel meth-
ods of the 80th Congress.

THE clear intent of those who pro-
moted the Budget and Accounting
Act of 1921 was to set up a real na-
tional auditor and investigator, an
officer of immense power. Congress
granted that power. No other ap-
pointed officer outside the judiciary
enjoys such a guarantee of independ-
ence. The Comptroller General is ap-
pointed by the President and confirmed
by the Senate for a term of fifteen
years. By this means it was intended
to place him beyond the reach or in-
fluence of succeeding Presidents and
Congresses. The President cannot
initiate removal of the Comptroller
General. Removal can be achieved
only by impeachment or by joint reso-
lution of Congress for specified causes.
In effect, this would only be for moral
turpitude of some sort. It could hardly
be for any political reason.

This great grant of independence
was considered unconstitutional by
President Wilson, who vetoed the first
version of the act. However, the bill
which was later signed by President
Harding contained only minor amend-


ments. Power to remove the Comp-
troller General is still slight and highly
academic.

Under the law the Comptroller
General can formulate policies which
affect the interests of Congress and
measurably enforce them on Executive
departments. The general terms of his
power are sweeping. He can settle all
claims in which the United States is
interested, either as debtor
or creditor, and such settle-
ment is "final and conclusive
upon the Executive branch
of the government." Most
important of all, he can on
his own initiative and with-
out direction of Congress
investigate "all matters relat-
ing to the receipt, disburse-
ment, and application of
public funds." In conduct-
ing investigations, he can command all
departments to furnish information
and to give access to all records upon
request. This transcends not only the
investigative power of any committee
of Congress but of all the committees
of both houses added together. The
Comptroller General exercises his
power "without direction from any
other officer."

But unfortunately, after granting this
officer all this power, Congress by law
and the Comptroller General by prac-
tice moved into the field of government
accounting. As a result, accounting,
which should be a function of the Ex-
ecutive, has bogged down and sub-
merged the functions of audit and
investigation.

IN short, Congress failed to distin-
guish between audit and control.
An audit, as I pointed out in a pre-
vious article, is an investigation and
report on the fidelity and legality of
completed transactions.

Control, on the other hand, is the
power to pass on expenditures and to
prevent their being made. In all busi-
ness and in government this is, or
should be, a function of executive
management. In so far as the Act of
1921 provided an independent auditor,
it was a great forward step in govern-
ment. But when control and account-
ing were added, practically all the
benefit of independence was lost and
the President was shorn of the power
to control his own affairs.
