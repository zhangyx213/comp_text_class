**'New' Republicanism?**

by Raymond Moley

AS THE center of interest shifts to
Washington again it may be well
to examine this "new" Republicanism
that we have been reading and hearing
so much about. There should really
be no great mystery about it
because in his acceptance speech at
San Francisco the President indicated
what he conceived to be necessary to
strengthen and enlarge the influence
of his party. That was a statement to
which all reasonable Republicans
could subscribe, both those who followed
the late Senator Taft and those who
opposed him.

Unfortunately the President's prescription
has been twisted to meet the
specifications of many people who
would, if they could, destroy real two-
party government by imposing upon
the Republican Party the economic
philosophy promoted so vigorously and
finally unsuccessfully by Presidents
Roosevelt and Truman—in short, a
wholesale acceptance of the ideal of a
welfare state with vast spending,
inflation, and a steady accumulation
of debt. This, we are asked to believe,
would be "progressive" and "new."

**OLD STUFF**

It is strange that intelligent people
can believe, after reflection, that
there is anything progressive or new
about this prescription. It is a policy
which takes more and more from citizens
by taxation and by depreciating the
value of their savings and returns a
part of that exaction to some of them
in bounties and subsidies through the
ministrations of a vast, expensive Federal
bureaucracy. This is old stuff,
temporarily serviceable in getting out
of a depression, but a deadly narcotic
in a healthy economy. It is as timeworn
as bribery. It is essentially a form of
buying votes—and with voters' money.

A truly dynamic society, as has been
suggested by the President himself
from time to time, is one in which
economic decisions are made by a
composite of countless individual
choices rather than by a government
bureaucracy and in which the individual
is permitted to spend the financial
fruits of his own labor rather than
to pay it out in taxes. Is this "reaction"
or are the people reactionary who
tell you that a bureaucracy can better
spend your money than you can? The

Bourbons of France during the reigns
of the many Louis' told their people
just that but they were not deluding
themselves with the idea that they
had invented something "new." They
also believed in centralized authority.
But centralized authority was old
when Lord Coke, fighting it in England,
interpreted the proud initials of the
Roman Empire S.P.Q.R. to mean
"Stultus Populus Quaerit Romam"—
a foolish people runneth to Rome.

What Republicans need is a regeneration
of the party at the state and local
level. This would be possible if the
Administration will recognize that an
appeal to the great middle interests
who want economic freedom—to buy
without the pinch of excessive taxes
and to work where there is work to
do and to be secure in their savings—
will bring out plenty of virile leadership.
In large part the degeneration of
Republican organizations (for there is
no real national party, but many state
and local organizations) has been
caused by the very growth in Federal
power and paternalism which foolish
people call "new."

As states and local governments have
been devitalized by the growth of
Federal government, so have the party
organizations. These, too, have been
"running to Rome" (the national
committee) for money to pay the
rent and the help.

**LOCAL LEADERSHIP**

Another factor which has weakened
local party organizations has been the
emergence of national media of communication.
The radio and television
have monopolized the attention of
voters at the expense of local candidates
and issues. Vast sums were spent to
elect Ike and Dick. Congressional
candidates had hard going.

The Democratic Party has a majority
in Congress because of three special
factors of strength, the one-party South,
city machines in Chicago and New
York, and the political arms of the unions.
Neutralize any one of these and there
would be a sizable Republican majority
in Congress. They can be neutralized only
at the local level. The White House can
encourage the growth of local leadership.
It cannot create it. Nor can it be created
by adopting a collectivist philosophy.
