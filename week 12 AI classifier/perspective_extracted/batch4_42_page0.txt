**The Human Side**

**by Raymond Moley**

IT HAS been said that the essence of
Greek tragedy is not that it pits
right against wrong, but right against
right. That this is the tragedy of the
integration issue is the contention of
James J. Kilpatrick, brilliant editorial
writer of *The Richmond News
Leader*. In his fine book, "The Sov-
ereign States," he wrote that "the
white Southerner, enmeshed in the
web of a dual society, is not insensitive
to the aspirations and desires of the
Negro people with whom he dwells
in so intimate a remoteness. Until
the school crisis arose, the white
South had been moving in a score of
areas toward a relief of grievances:
In the hiring of Negro police and Ne-
gro firemen, in the election of Negroes
to public office, in the gradual relin-
quishment of Jim Crow laws in places
of public assembly, in the opening of
new job opportunities to Negroes
equally with whites—in these and
other fields without the compulsion
of court proceedings, perceptible
changes were taking place. Many
other changes could have been
foreseen. Now with the Negro's threat
to the white South's schools, the cus-
toms that had been yielding have
stiffened again."

That was written in 1956. During
the two years since, the relationship
between the two races in Virginia has
suffered increasing deterioration. To-
day communication has all but broken
down. The white supporter of "mas-
sive resistance" asserts indignantly
that his rights and responsibilities
have been grossly violated. He also
feels an anguished concern for the fu-
ture. The Negro—the average Negro—
is bewildered and deeply hurt. There
has been forcibly jolted into him the
feeling that he is "not wanted."

**THE ROAD BACK**

For example, Negro physicians
were admitted to the Medical Society
of Virginia in 1951. In 1955 the Rich-
mond Academy of Medicine almost
rolled up the necessary two-thirds
majority to admit Negroes. But a new
motion to admit them, introduced in
1958, was tabled by an overwhelming
majority. A Negro councilman was
elected in Richmond in 1948. That
would be impossible now.
The traditional attitude of the Vir-
ginian has embodied a sincere, af-
fectionate concern that the Negro
should get ahead economically and
culturally. Negroes are admitted to
the University of Virginia. But Vir-
ginians are determined that the Ne-
gro's right to equal opportunity shall
not endanger their right to conduct
their constitutionally guaranteed state
affairs and that they will preserve
their own special standards in racial
relations. They see in sorrow that the
Negro now will lose much that he has
gained in recognition of his rights, in
achievement, and in respect. Mod-
erates will, as always in such cases,
be overwhelmed North and South by
irrational extremists on both sides of
this issue. Lasting hatreds and legal
chaos may well be the bitter harvest
in such an event.

**OUR DEBT TO VIRGINIA**

To be sure, it is possible to discuss
the constitutional aspects of Virginia's
massive resistance without a consid-
eration of the human values involved,
despite the fact that the Supreme
Court's 1954 opinion itself was based
upon such values rather than law. But
this would be presenting a half-truth.
The truth is that the Constitution of
the United States, with its checks and
balances, its limitations on Federal
power, was precisely designed to pro-
tect individual liberty, most precious
among human values. The Virginian's
faith in this constitutional system,
which Virginians had so dominant a
part in creating, is, they believe, en-
dangered by the Supreme Court in
many fields other than schools. They
contend that the Court's present phi-
losophy will lose for the states many
protections which have acted as a
check upon total Federal power, with
its potential of tyranny over all indi-
viduals, Negro and white alike.

In considering the crisis in Virginia
we, in other states, must bear in mind
that we are dealing with a very dis-
tinguished and progressive common-
wealth, among the foremost in
enlightenment and first in those tradi-
tions which encompass our national
heritage of constitutional order, our
liberties, and our statecraft. When we
witness the legal convulsions that are
current there, we must not forget
that background.
