**Peril in the Treaty Power**

*by Raymond Moley*

THE best test of a man's belief that
the Constitution should restrain
those in power comes when he him-
self is vested with power. Under that
rigorous rule, Secretary Dulles makes
something less than a perfect score.

For some years, since it became
fashionable in international circles to
favor universal regulation of matters
that used to be purely domestic con-
cerns, there has been grow-
ing apprehension in the
minds of lovers of liberty
under the Constitution. This
apprehension was most
acute among good constitu-
tional lawyers who knew
the vast power that rests in
the making of treaties.
Among those lawyers was
John Foster Dulles who, in
addressing the American
Bar Association a year ago, said:
"The treatymaking power is an ex-
traordinary power, liable to abuse.
Treaties make international law and
also they make domestic law. Under
our Constitution, treaties become the
supreme law of the land. They are,
indeed, more supreme than ordinary
laws, for Congressional laws are invalid
if they do not conform to the Con-
stitution, whereas treaty law can over-
ride the Constitution. Treaties, for
example, can take powers away from
the Congress and give them to the
President; they can take powers from
the states and give them to the Fed-
eral government or to some interna-
tional body, and they can cut across
the rights given the people by the
constitutional Bill of Rights."

Perhaps the most glaring example
of the danger of the abuse mentioned
by Mr. Dulles lies in what is called
the Covenant on Human Rights of the
U.N. Mrs. Roosevelt was our major
representative in the drafting of this
document. Its net effect would be, if
adopted by us as a treaty—and that is
exactly what was intended—to amend
our Bill of Rights by a lot of vague
aspirations promoted by soft-headed
Americans and representatives of so-
cialist governments abroad. "Prop-
erty," now an American right, would
under this strange covenant vanish in
a cloud of indeterminate "personal
security."

Despite their respect for Mrs.
Roosevelt's good intentions, able law-

yers have believed her poorly quali-
fied to amend the work of the makers
of the American Constitution. Among
those lawyers was Mr. Dulles in
April 1952.

In April 1953, Mr. Dulles still be-
lieves just that. He said to the Senate
Judiciary Committee that he believes
the Covenant on Human Rights and
other such examples of international
meddling with our domestic
concerns should not be
adopted. He asked the Sen-
ate to believe his assurance
that he and the President
will not request the cove-
nant's adoption to be suffi-
cient protection for the
future. In saying this, he
made two points that are
hard to reconcile: first, that
a protective constitutional
amendment is unnecessary, and, sec-
ond, that the "whole matter requires
further study." Our fears, he said,
are hypothetical.

The assurance of always having an
Eisenhower or Dulles is "hypotheti-
cal." For until Jan. 20 last there sat
in the White House a President who
fostered these invasions of our liberty.
We are as likely to have a Truman in
1962 as an Eisenhower.

Mr. Dulles made another statement
that is doubtful indeed. He said
"agreements" made by the President
alone "cannot become constitutionally
"the law of the land'." I don't know
what Mr. Dulles meant by "land." But
I do know that in U.S. vs. Pink in 1942,
the U.S. Supreme Court said that an
agreement by Roosevelt and Litvinov
in 1933 superseded the law of Mr.
Dulles's state of New York.

THE danger of abuse stirred the
American Bar Association five
years ago, when a committee of
distinguished lawyers set to work to
devise a protective constitutional
amendment. A result of their studies,
as well as that of several senators,
is a proposed constitutional amend-
ment introduced by no less than 64
senators, some of them excellent law-
yers. They do not believe the danger
to be "hypothetical," and their pro-
posal should become the "law of the
land" while we still have Messrs.
Eisenhower and Dulles temporarily
to guard our liberties.
