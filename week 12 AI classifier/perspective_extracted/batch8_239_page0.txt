**Our Stake in Europe**

We Americans would be less than
human if we did not consider how the successive
convulsions of Europe may, in the long run,
affect ourselves. Because of this concern, we are
energetically seeking to arm ourselves for adequate
defense and re-examining our so-called neutrality
legislation—which is actually not neutrality legislation
at all, but an attempt to enforce precautions that
may keep us out of war.

A rather unsatisfactory attempt, too, it must be
added. For, as it stands, it represents a compromise
between two wholly contradictory schools of thought on
how we can best stay at peace. The first, which may
be called the President Roosevelt school, says that we
can insure peace by giving at least economic support
to that side in a foreign conflict which is morally
“right” and that Congress should give the President
wide discretionary authority to throw our support to
the side he judges “right.” The second school, of which
Senator Nye is a prominent exponent, maintains that
the United States can stay out of foreign wars by a
complete embargo of arms, goods and money to all
foreign belligerents.

The “neutrality” act now on the books falls somewhere
between these two positions. It imposes a ban on the
export of arms, ammunition and implements of war to
belligerents, provided the President has declared that a
war exists. It prohibits credits and loans to belligerents.
It gives the President discretion about prohibiting
American ships to carry to belligerents such materials as
cotton, copper, oil and iron (essential commodities in
the waging of modern warfare) and discretion to require
that such materials be paid for in cash. And so, the law
is neither fish, flesh, fowl, nor a good red herring. The
President can, as he has done, favor one side or the other
by exercising his discretionary power. Recent events have
properly provoked a reexamination of this law. The Nye
school insists that what has happened merely
demonstrates the need for plugging up the law’s
loopholes. The President Roosevelt school insists that
what is happening in Europe justifies his belief that more
executive discretion is needed so that the United States
can employ some of those “many methods short of war,
but stronger and more effective than mere words, of
bringing home to aggressor governments the aggregate
sentiments of our own people.” And Senator Pittman, who
agrees with the President, has come for-


ward with a new “neutrality” act to take the place of the
old one.

This new proposal is designed to win the support of the
Nye-school adherents by certain ingenious concessions. It
would compel the President to recognize the existence of a
state of war (whether war was declared or undeclared)—
thus removing one element of Presidential discretion. It
would compel the President to require that such materials
as cotton, copper and the rest be paid for in cash and to
prohibit their shipment in American vessels—thus
removing a second important element of Presidential
discretion. But it would also remove the mandatory
prohibition on the shipment of arms and munitions to
belligerents—thus removing what the Nye school considers
one of the firmest barriers against our involvement in war.

Yet this is not the chief objection to it in the minds of
those who are aware of Presidential leanings in the field of
foreign relations. The most important feature of the
Pittman proposal is the unneutral motive behind it. It is
frankly designed to enable those nations which have control
of the seas (England, France and their allies) to buy guns
and munitions in this country. It is admittedly intended
to give them an advantage over Germany. This is not an
incidental by-product of the “neutrality” law’s revision.
It is its purpose.

Now the promise implicit in this move is that we can
undertake to help England and France this way and still
keep out of any European war in which they may engage.
Unfortunately, it is a promise that no one can guarantee.
You cannot frankly give to one side in a war what you
withhold from the other side without courting, first,
reprisals and, ultimately, war. There is no such thing as a
little unneutrality. When a nation declares and implements
its hostile sentiments toward one side in a conflict, the
chances that it can persuade that side of its disinterestedness
are pretty slim.

Still, even recognizing this risk, the American people may
wish to throw their weight on the side of Great Britain and
France. No objective observer of public opinion can doubt
that, with each of Germany’s moves in the past year, hostile
feeling against Germany has grown in this country. This
feeling has not yet reached the point of active desire to
enter a war against Germany. But it may. And, before it
does, while it is still possible to separate facts from
emotions, it will be useful to consider the reasons given by
people who believe that we must intervene in the European
situation.


**NEWSWEEK, APRIL 3, 1939**

1—We are told that we must help the democracies because
two or more forms of government cannot coexist in the
world, because the world must become either all democratic
or all totalitarian. This, of course, is a fallacy. Should we act
on it, entering a war in the belief that we were engaging in a
holy war to “save democracy,” we would find ourselves
embarked on wars as hopeless and as bootless as the religious
wars of 300 or 400 years ago. We should have to learn—as
we learned that different religions could coexist within a state
under the principle of toleration—that different political
ideologies can live side by side.

2—Then we are told that we must take action against
Germany because of her fiendish brutalities to religious,
political and social minorities. There is no question but that
Hitler has created in the minds of all the decent people in
this country a feeling of horror and revulsion. But, however
strongly we may feel on this subject, a practical consideration
enters. Will war against a government because it is intolerant
to its own people help those the government persecutes? Or
will it result in an intensification of their persecution and an
immediate destruction everywhere of human lives and other
precious human values which will be irreplaceable? Will it,
for instance, strengthen democratic government in the United
States? Or will war bring upon us here a centralized control
of life and speech and press and property so absolute that we
lose here the very values for which we fight abroad?

3—More pertinent is the question whether it is not best for
us to throw our support to Great Britain and thus prevent the
possible destruction of the British sea power. Undoubtedly
the problem of our own defense of the Western Hemisphere
would be vastly complicated by the destruction of the British sea
power. But is its preservation worth participation in the great
holocaust that war has come to be?

These are the questions every thoughtful citizen must ask
himself honestly before he makes a final decision. There is no
absolute answer to most of them. But it would be madness not to
ponder the alternatives before we are carried away.

And now, since Mussolini has spoken, it is hard to see why
France and England cannot take a long step toward peace by
concessions centering in Jibuti, Suez and Tunisia. Yes, of
course, France says its face must be saved. Particularly, I
suppose, the face of Georges Bonnet, now Foreign Minister,
who, Americans should remember, was French Finance
Minister in 1933 when France found a way to save both its face
and its money as payment on the debt to us came due. The
faces of politicians can be redeemed or replaced. The blood of
the youth of this country cannot.
