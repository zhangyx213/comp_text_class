**Harvest of Folly**

by Raymond Moley

THE elections last week should be a
bitterly painful reminder to the
Administration of its past political mis-
takes and miscalculations and the ne-
cessity of some agonizing reappraisal
of its strategy. Otherwise, 1958 will
be a disaster of great magnitude.

One thing is certain. The wounds
from which this Republican Adminis-
tration is suffering are self-inflicted.
Never was a party offered a greater
opportunity for leadership than when
the Democrats sank beneath the mess
in Washington in 1952. A nation, long
suffering first from collectivist eco-
nomic policies in the 1930s, then a
war, then an unbelievable loss of
the peace, then spending without
limit, and another war, and, finally,
crude, shabby corruption, turned to
the Republican Party for what it be-
lieved would be honest, sound, con-
servative government.

For the moment there was meas-
urable realization of that sort of relief.
There was unity in the party because
two strong men, the President and
Senator Taft, found it possible to work
together. A generally good and in part
exceptional Cabinet was chosen.
There was less spending in 1953 and
1954, and some tax relief. A new
Hoover commission and a commission
on intergovernmental relations were
set to work making government more
efficient and less centralized.

**ENDEMIC AFFLICTION**

But after the death of Taft there
broke out, in an especially virulent
form, an endemic affliction which has
plagued the Republican Party for 90
years. This manifests itself in a Repub-
lican habit of attacking Republicans
rather than Democrats. The disunity
thus created produced a Democratic
Congress in 1955 and the loss of sev-
eral governorships.

Then the Administration repudiated
its earlier conservatism and set out to
rival the New and Fair Deals in turn-
ing to more and more costly and more
centralized government, ignoring as it
did so not only its earlier promises but
the considered recommendations of
the aforementioned commissions.

A most unfortunate manifestation of
Republican centrifugation was the
witless invention of the term "modern"
Republicanism. This could not win
favor with a public calloused to se-
mantic appeals. But it revealed to the
nation that the President spoke for
only a faction of the Republican Party,
and it deeply offended regular Re-
publicans who had been mustering 20
million votes in long years of defeat.

Moreover, it provided a hunting li-
cense for marplots in and around the
White House to go forth and attack
stalwart Republicans. Some of these
were Dewey people still fighting the
old Taft war. Some, like Paul
Hoffman, had the effrontery to sug-
gest that their ideas concerning
purges of Republicans were also in
the President's mind.

**SOMETHING FOR NOTHING**

Finally, after the segregation deci-
sion in 1954, hailed by the Vice Presi-
dent at a party gathering as the work
of a "Republican" Chief Justice, there
seemed to be a plan to win the Negro
vote in the North at the expense of
scuttling the growing Republican
Party in the South. In this the master
strategist was the Attorney General.
The Rev. Clayton Powell presides
over a principality with nearly 50,000
votes in the heart of Harlem. Upon
him the Administration in 1956 be-
stowed attentions almost as ardent as
those received by King Saud and, in
return, he came out for the President.
The election last week showed a
switch of a few more than a thousand
voters. Much the same is true of Ne-
gro voters elsewhere in New York and
in New Jersey.

Meanwhile, the precarious margin
of two Republican congressmen in
Virginia has probably been erased,
and the chance of establishing a real
Republican opposition in the state has
vanished for a generation to come. In
1958 the harvest of folly may well be
seen in other places in the South
where Republicanism has been a lusty
growing sprout.

To take a cynical view of the case,
which, I believe, is justified because
the policy of which I speak was con-
ceived in cynicism, the sin of these
Administration strategists transcends
law, principle, national unity, and
public policy. They have committed
the politician's ultimate and most
atrocious transgression. They have
given something for nothing.
