**After Kefauver---What?**

by RAYMOND MOLEY

NASHVILLE—While Senator Kefauver was preparing in Washington to wind up his hearings last week, an interesting item appeared in *The Memphis Commercial Appeal*. It appeared under the caption “Fifty Years Ago.” It was this: “March 28, 1901—Chief of Police Jerome Richards has issued instructions prohibiting racing touts from remaining in Memphis during the racing season. They will be allowed to remain at the track, Chief Richards said, because this does not come under his jurisdiction.”

Two observations occurred to me when I read that, neither of which is intended to suggest any doubt about the value and constructive results of the senator’s investigation. One of these is that on that date, two years before the senator was born, the evils which he has revealed were in existence and were known to all. The second observation bears directly on the first lesson that must be derived from this investigation. It is that the issue still is largely one of jurisdiction.

In the years between 1919 and 1931, it was a part of my professional duties to participate in surveys of criminal-law administration in Ohio, Missouri, Illinois, New York, and a number of other states. It has been interesting to compare and contrast the conditions revealed by Kefauver’s hearings with those revealed in those studies two or more decades ago.

One difference, of course, is that the big money that was the root of evil in the 1920s came from illegal traffic in liquor, while in the present instances it comes from gambling. But in the 1920s the bootlegging fraternity were graduates of the gambling racket of pre-Prohibition days. Some of these present-day rascals have lived through three eras—gambling, bootlegging, and gambling again—if they have been fortunate enough to escape homicide or the punishment therefor. But their way with law enforcement and politics remains the same. Where wealth accumulates, politicians decay. We have at the root of things, therefore, a constant problem of law enforcement and public morals.

No national crime commission such as Senator Kefauver suggests is going to bring about a solution, and no Federal legislation will help very much. The problem is nearer home.

In pre-Prohibition days, it was generally city police, prosecutors, and judges who were being seduced by criminal money. By the 1920s, a change was taking place. Crime had begun to move out into the suburbs. Automobiles were with us, and good roads were developing. Now there are more automobiles and more good roads. And as in the 1920s, there is inflation.

Hence, the heavy impact of what is sometimes called “progress” is hurled at the most ancient and dilapidated of our law-enforcement institutions—the county sheriff. Considering this fact, it is strange that anyone is ever punished for a crime. The sheriff, or “shire-reeve,” as he was medievally known, is older than the Church of England or Parliament. The duties he is supposed to perform are much what they were before Columbus discovered America. He generally operates under no board or other authority. There is a sort of responsibility to a remote governor, but that is not effective control.


LEGISLATURES should reduce the job of sheriff to that of a jailkeeper and a server of court papers. Law enforcement outside the major cities should be vested in properly organized state police. There is no reason why a state police force should be limited to highway patrol, although this is so in many states. It should be composed of various divisions or squads—for traffic, for vice and gambling, and other functions normally a part of a metropolitan department. This recommendation was made repeatedly in the 1920s, but little came of it because of the joint opposition of the sheriffs and of some leaders of organized labor, who for many years opposed any form of state police.

If the senators want to take the first step toward a solution of their problem, let them urge their legislatures to end the sheriff travesty, despite the power that sheriffs pack in a Senatorial election. Next week in this space I shall pursue this subject further.
