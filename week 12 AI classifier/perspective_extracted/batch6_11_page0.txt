**The Vice of Vagueness**

by Raymond Moley

THE Chief Justice uses the expression "the vice of vagueness" in condemning a Congressional investigation in the Watkins case. But he convicts himself of the "vice" in his long, rambling opinion. His segregation opinion was an essay in sociology; but this one invokes almost the entire undergraduate curriculum: Political science, sociology, history, ethics, psychology. At odd moments there are bits of law. The "vice" in such a jumble is that the dicta involved may well give birth to a great wave of lawsuits.

Already the chickens of litigation are coming home to roost as the result of the decision regarding the FBI files, which I discussed in this space three weeks ago. In that case the Court held that an accused person may have access to FBI files. But it failed to specify when such access should be given. Hence, one trial judge, following the Supreme Court's opinion, has ordered that all FBI material regarding one Frank—a former FBI agent who as an agent of the Dominican Republic was charged with violating a Federal law—be submitted to the defendant some days before trial. At the same time, another Federal judge interpreted the Supreme Court's ruling as permitting such examination of the files only after the trial is under way. The result of such conflicts is that U.S. district attorneys all over the country are utterly confused. Many a guilty person will escape punishment because of such uncertainty and the much more serious consideration that the government must at all costs protect the secrecy of FBI records.

**BRENNAN'S MISTAKE**

All this might have been corrected, had Justice Brennan simply made it a rule that the district judge alone might examine the files and determine what properly should be revealed to the defendant and his lawyer. Congress should, without delay, end this confusion.

In the California case, in which the convictions of five persons were invalidated and a retrial ordered for nine others, Justice Harlan interpreted the language of the Smith Act so narrowly that it might seem hopeless ever to stamp out legally the organized Communist conspiracy in the United States. Moreover, in this case the Court followed the extraordinary course of reviewing and judging the evidence itself.

The Watkins case involves a defendant, a labor-union official, who admitted before a Congressional committee that he had participated most actively in Communist affairs, although he denied that he was a member of the party. Watkins said that while he would answer questions about people he knew to be Communists, he would not discuss others whom he knew in his past associations.

**FRANKFURTER IN REVERSE**

Two questions are involved here. The less important one is whether the information Watkins refused to give was relevant to the concern of the Congressional committee. The Warren opinion apparently permits Watkins himself to decide that, despite plain common sense which would indicate that such information about collaborators is vital to an understanding of the operations of a conspiracy against the peace and security of the nation.

The big question is whether the Court has any right to invade the province of Congress, which in its power to investigate has the inherent right to determine its own methods. Justice Frankfurter said in his concurring opinion that "the scope of inquiry that a committee is authorized to pursue must be defined with sufficiently unambiguous clarity to safeguard a witness from the hazards of vagueness."

Writing in 1924 in the *New Republic*, a Prof. Felix Frankfurter said: "Congressional inquiry ought not to be fettered by advance rigidities, because in the light of experience there can be no reasonable doubt that such curtailment would make effective investigation almost impossible... The power of investigation should be left untrammeled, and the methods and forms should be left for determination of Congress and its committees, as each situation arises."

I believe that the professor, rather than the Supreme Court Justice, has the better of the argument.
