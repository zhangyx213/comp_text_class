**BOOKS**

dle Ages, women were upbraided for
wearing too much clothing and men, for
wearing too little. So much material went
into women's elaborate gowns that the
fourteenth-century clergy thundered
and berated them for profligacy. Parliament
and pulpit, however, joined forces
to make men wear more.

Actually, décolletage has probably
caused less stir than almost any facet of
women's clothing. Waist-deep necklines
were common in the Middle Ages, but
sleeves had to reach to the second finger
joint. Bare arms were long considered
indecent and even in the libidinous court
of Charles II, the upper arm was prudently
covered.

Little Mice: It was the exposure of
feminine feet which caused the greatest
fashion uproar in history. Not until the
reign of Elizabeth I did women dare reveal
a glimpse of their shoes. In the
next century, Sir John Suckling apostrophized
the dainty feet which "like little
mice, stole in and out" from beneath a
petticoat—a simile which provokes nothing
but horror today, when the average
woman wears a 7A. In the middle of the
last century, women's feet were considered
so indecent that photographers
usually removed them from family photographs,
so that most Victorian ladies
looked as though they were practicing
the fine art of levitation.

The modern man, in his dreary clothing,
may sigh for the fustian glories of
not so long ago. But this nostalgia only
suggests that he is the victim of appearances.
He might console himself with
the knowledge that the Elizabethan
fashion plate moved about under a
wooden framework, his peasecod-bellied
doublet filled with old rags, bran, sawdust,
and tow, while his head perched
atop an unyielding ruff.

Today's male, who can whip his tie into
shape in less than twenty seconds,
has only an atavistic memory of Beau
Brummel, who needed three hours to
adjust his cravat. But then Brummel had
his gloves made by four different glovers,
one of whom specialized only in thumbs.
When he went to a party, his white
satin-lined sedan chair collected him in
his dressing room and deposited him in
his hostess's salon, lest his splendor be
marred by a single speck of dust.

**Memories:** Somber and practical
though today's clothing may be, it is still
a throwback to a more vivid past. The
man of today may not carry a fan, but he
has at least two distinctive elements in
his drab garb: His tie comes to him from
the Roman legions, who were allowed
to cover their throats against the damp
British climate, and the bit of black velvet
on his coat collar proclaims that he is
still in mourning for Louis XVI.

**Summing Up:** 'Twas ever thus.

ment and, strangely enough, trust-
busting. President Truman sent the
Havana Charter to Congress which refused
to do anything more than to hold
some hearings. But in 1949 we entered
the International Wheat Agreement and
through the State Department actively
participated in many international economic
committees and commissions.
Prime Minister Attlee came here in December
1950 to plead for international
control and allocation of raw materials
so that his country could get the things
it needed "at the right price." Our State
Department complied the next month
and created what was known as the
International Materials Conference. This
had no legal standing but set out to
allocate strategic materials and fix prices.
This brought forth plans for agreements
covering cotton, wool, copper, lead, zinc,
sulphur, and other materials.

In 1952 the Paley commission (President's
Materials Policy Commission)
made the statement that, regardless of
the failure of Congress to act, the U.S.
was bound under a resolution of the
ECOSOC to "recognize Chapter VI [of
the Havana Charter] as a general guide."
Despite violent protests in Congress, the
collaboration went on in one form or
another. In 1953 we entered the International
Sugar Agreement and extended
the International Wheat Agreement for
three years.

Thus encouraged, the State Department
proposed a tin agreement last year.
It was given up by the Administration
after a hard fight between the State Department
on one side and the Interior
and Commerce Departments on the
other. Meanwhile, the Randall commission
roundly condemned participation by
the U.S. in international commodity
agreements and Preston Hotchkiss of
ECOSOC has vigorously opposed them.
The ECE seems to assume that these
objections can be avoided.

It is significant that the current oil report
is the product of the secretariat of the ECE
at the head of which is Gunnar
Myrdal, a Swedish socialist. He first appears
in American annals as a beneficiary
of a Rockefeller fellowship. Next he was
employed by the Carnegie Corp. to make
a $250,000 survey of the Negro Problem
in our South. This report in 1944 had
some strong things to say about the U.S.
Our Constitution was "impractical and
unsuited to modern conditions" and its
adoption was "nearly a plot against the
common people." We had "a low degree
of respect for law and order" although
we "desire to regulate human behavior
tyrannically." Our legal culture, moreover,
was "anarchistic."

Myrdal in 1946 told a Wall Street
Journal reporter that in behalf of
Sweden he had made a big deal with
Soviet Russia because he believed that
the United States was going into a depression.
In 1949, as executive secretary
of the ECE, he received a grant from
the Rockefeller Foundation for scholarships
for European students. Last year
Columbia University selected Myrdal as
one of those to be highly honored at its
bicentennial. He was given a degree of
Doctor of Humane Letters as one who
had made "the world his classroom."

In any event, these many benefits and
honors for Myrdal, coupled with the
present attack upon the American oil
companies, can prove to Americans not
only that they are a very generous people
but that when oil money is given for
cultural purposes it has no strings. This
at least can give our oil companies some
melancholy comfort.
