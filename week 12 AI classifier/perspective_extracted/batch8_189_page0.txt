**Perspective**

**Borah the Senator**

“W
hat makes the majesty of the
heroes of the senate and the field…?
The consciousness of a train of great days
and victories behind… Honor is ven-
erable to us… It is always ancient virtue.
We worship it today, because it is not of
today. We love it and pay it homage,
because it is not a trap for our love and
homage, but is self-dependent, self-derived,
and therefore of an old immaculate pedi-
gree… The force of character is cumula-
tive.”

Thus, writing many years ago, Emerson
gave us a hint of the reason why
Americans bow their heads before the
profoundly moving reality of Senator
Borah’s passing.

The last week’s laudatory obituaries,
even taken all together, fall short of ex-
plaining the nation’s poignant sense of loss.
Borah was independent, they say. True.
But others have been even more independ-
ent of party and factional ties. Borah was
eloquent. But there have been others as
eloquent. He was a great constitutionalist,
a constructive force in forming opinion.
But there have been others as notable.
All this does not explain him. Borah
commanded a place in American life that
dwarfed any exact summation of his spe-
cific personal qualities and achievements.
The American people loved Borah and
paid him homage because whenever he
rose majestically in the Senate they were
conscious of an ancient, honorable virtue,
of a train of great days behind. He was of
the strain of Calhoun, Webster, Clay,
Sumner, Benton, Douglas, Jefferson Davis,
Sherman, Hanna, Aldrich, Hoar, Under-
wood, Beveridge and La Follette. Their
light lengthened his shadow, just as his
will lengthen the shadow of senators who
follow him. Borah was “of an old immacu-
late pedigree.” He was a Senator in the
towering tradition of the Senate.

What is a senator? There are more
than ninety living answers to the question.
But, in the main, they group themselves
within the circles of two theories of our
government.

The first, too often expressed these days,
is that when a party or a President re-
ceives more than a bare majority of the
nation’s votes, all those senatorial candi-
dates who wore the colors of that party
or President are bound by the unified will
of the majority and must obey it.

The other theory roots in a concept ex-
pounded by those who made the Constitu-
tion. It defines government not as the
articulate and regnant will of a majority
but as the distribution of sovereignty
among enough coordinate agencies of gov-
ernment to make certain something ap-
proaching a government of and for all the
people—a government under which mi-
norities are safe because they share in the
custody of its power. It holds that the
majority does rule: but it insists that the
majority rule in terms of a covenant de-
liberately adopted and scrupulously main-
tained. It does not believe that govern-
ment by the consent of the people means
the unrestrained exercise of the will of the
majority. It believes that government by
unrestrained majority may be a tyranny
as dangerous as dictatorship, since tyran-
nical majorities are the muck out of which
dictators grow. It conceives of the Ameri-
can republic, if its constitutional tradi-
tions remain intact, as neither government
by majority nor government by minority.
It knows that despite the fuzzy oratory
of politics, the alternative to minority gov-
ernment is not majority government. It
knows that true popular government is
neither.

The first theory is what impels
some senatorial candidates to run on slo-
gans of 100 per cent allegiance to some
President or other. It is what seems to
give sanction to purges and threats of
purges directed against nonconformist sen-
ators. It is what seems to justify brutal
acts of political retaliation against Ad-
ministration critics.

Borah laughed at such, at first. And
then, after a time, he didn’t even have to
laugh. No one dared to threaten him,
much less to strafe him for his independ-
ence. He would have figuratively stripped
the hide off anyone who had. It is worth
mentioning that after the Supreme Court
fight, when the attempted purge of oppo-
sition senators was at its height, Borah,
who had been one of them, far from be-
ing punished, was actually requested to
welcome the President to Idaho as he
passed through the state.

Borah never sought personal aggrandize-
ment. He sought only the opportunity to
try to sway opinion to his views. Early
in the Harding Administration he pushed
with great persistence for an arms confer-
ence. The Administration wanted such a
conference too. But not on Borah’s ini-
tiative. To its dismay, the public support
for Borah was so overwhelming that his
resolution prevailed. It was, Senator Hi-
ram Johnson has said, “the greatest per-
sonal triumph that has been won by a
senator in my time.” That the Harding
Administration appropriated the fruits of
this triumph did not disturb Borah. He
calmly went on pressing new causes. Even
the lost causes he sponsored added cubits
to his stature. The man who can take de-
feat calmly must always be reckoned with.
In his thirty-three years as a sena-
tor, Borah served with—never under—
seven Presidents. He bore them all appro-
priate formal respect. But he treated them
as equals. That was as it should be, be-
cause, as a senator, he embodied the co-
ordinate power of the body to which he
belonged. Again and again he championed,
always on the high plane of constitutional
argument, the right of the Senate to exer-
cise that coordinate power. Presidents
might chafe under his dissents. But none
of the seven failed to respect his force and
influence—a force and influence not alone
of his personal intelligence, eloquence and
dignity, but derived from the eminent
vantage point from which he chose to
argue.

Those who, from time to time, find
the Senate able to frustrate their wishes—
and this includes all Presidents—complain
of its obstructionism. But there is some-
thing more important to human freedom
than expeditious action. That something is
national security—the preservation of per-
sonal rights—the maintenance of the sys-
tem without which such rights can never
be safe. For the impulsive urge to achieve
a good thing today may be tomorrow’s
plunge to national disaster.

Generations ago The Federalist said
this, in speaking of the Senate, more co-
gently than anyone has said it since.

“There are particular moments in pub-
lic affairs,” said The Federalist, “when the
people, stimulated by some irregular pas-
sion, or some illicit advantage, or misled
by the artful misrepresentations of inter-
ested men, may call for measures which
they themselves will afterwards be the
most ready to lament and condemn. In
these critical moments, how salutary will
be the interference of some temperate…
body of citizens in order to check the mis-
guided career, and to suspend the blow
meditated by the people against them-
selves, until reason, justice, and truth can
regain their authority over the public
mind?”

We Americans will feel the restraining
hand of the Senate often in the months
ahead. It may often irritate us. We may
sometimes think of wrenching loose. But
we cannot forget what might have been,
over the years, without the vigilance of
the Senate. And no one in our time more
completely personified that vigilance than
Senator Borah. He respected the past be-
cause he wanted, so passionately, to serve
the future.
