**PERSPECTIVE**

**THE WITHERED ARM—II**

**BY RAYMOND MOLEY**

Above the din of jet aircraft, the news did not penetrate to the Senate Appropriations Committee that the future of our position in Southeast Asia rests on sea transport. Simultaneously with the ominous weakening of Singapore in the defense of the crucial Malacca Strait, the committee canceled a cargo ship added by the House to the building program which is a vital part of our power to meet critical events in the Far East.

War in Vietnam, like the Korean War, is a maritime operation that rests on our capability of delivering men and equipment across thousands of miles of sea. For Korea we had "a bridge of ships" which is gone today.

In an article recently prepared for publication, Adm. John D. Hayes, U.S.N. (Ret.) points up that in the Korean War, Japan was a base of operations not unlike Britain in the war against Germany. We have no such nearby base today and must depend on the more distant Okinawa, Guam and Philippines. In Japan there is virulent opposition to our Vietnamese policy and a political situation that is none too stable.

**'FINISHED WITH ENGINES'**

At Da Nang, Hayes points out, Marines landed from virtually the same ships that landed their ancestors on Okinawa in 1945 and at Inchon in 1950. The 173rd Airborne Brigade was not airlifted from Okinawa to Saigon. It was transported in aging LST's, of which only a few now remain.

When the Korean War began, we had 2,868 fairly new and efficient dry-cargo ships. Today there are only 131 under fifteen years of age. In the government reserve there remain, along with the famous old Liberties "finished with engines," a few hundred efficient World War II vessels. The Navy, calling last year for ships for an amphibious exercise, found that about 157 ships of the active merchant fleet could meet requirements of speed and cargo-lifting equipment and, of these, only 121 had an additional required feature in standard cargo rig.

In 1957 the replacement program of the subsidized lines began to take effect. The world's finest ships are among the 99 built at vast expenditure by those companies with the help of the government's construction subsidy to the shipyards. They have very great speed, which is of the essence in wartime. Where shore facilities are inadequate for unloading, they are self-sufficient. Many ships of the subsidized fleet are already in service to Vietnam. But the building program in the face of developing demands in the Far East has been slowed down by budgetary decisions.

An air transport carries limited cargo, but this is a question of millions of tons. Besides, all aircraft are hungry consumers of fuel, which is transported by sea. There is great tanker tonnage available, but we are deficient in those of "handy" size for shallow ports. Only a few have been built.

**THE LENGTHENING REACH**

Equipment must go by sea not only to an increasing number of American troops but also to the South Vietnamese Army. Food must go to the population, and bases must be built with material brought by ship. Meanwhile, cargo ships must haul the supplies for armed forces elsewhere. There is the lifeline to Puerto Rico, Hawaii and Alaska. A number of vessels are committed by law to serve essential trade routes. We ship foreign aid and must also try to continue to carry the 5 per cent of our commercial cargoes that go by U.S. ships—when they are not strikebound.

More than 99 per cent of all American overseas transport is by ship. May we look for help from our maritime friends? The price is rising, for they are busy and also carry for the Russians and Red China. Many of their ships have been thriving in the enemy supply line to the Viet Cong. While the power of Britain falters at Singapore, her shipping companies—whining "Freedom of the seas!"—lengthen the Communist reach toward the free world's British-protected jugular vein east of Suez. Japan, like Britain and West Germany, builds ships for the Communists, and demands that we return Okinawa—a staging base for the war in Vietnam. It is in that peculiar "One World" of international shipping that we must now shop around to supplement our "fourth arm of defense."
