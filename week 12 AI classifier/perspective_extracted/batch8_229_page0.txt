**Perspective**

**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

**Economic Totalitarianism**

The testimony of Mr. A. A. Berle
Jr. before the Monopoly Committee re-
cently deserves far more attention than it
is getting. A plan such as Mr. Berle de-
scribes is not to be laughed off, as are
most of the scrambled economic schemes
emanating from the Administration. Mr.
Berle thinks clearly. He knows precisely
what he is driving at. His proposal is a
considered one and a plausible one. It
would also stand our present economic
system on its head.

Briefly, Mr. Berle proposes that govern-
ment set up a special banking system for
capital credit to serve the needs both of
private business and of public agencies.
Money is to be lent for private businesses
and for "nonproductive purposes" such as,
presumably, the building of hospitals,
bridges and other public conveniences. A
very low rate of interest is to be charged.
The government is to guarantee such
loans, which would not appear as expendi-
tures in the Federal budget. The process
by which money would be routed to the
happy recipients of these funds would be
a sort of phantom circuit or induction. But,
of course, the government credit would be
burdened indirectly, just as an individual's
credit is burdened when he endorses an-
other man's note. Any man who has found
his fellow endorsers unable to meet their
obligations knows that bankruptcy can be
reached by this road as well as by any
other.

The foundation of this plan is imbedded
in a profound conviction of Mr. Berle's.
He believes that the present lack of capital
expenditures is the result not of restric-
tions imposed upon individuals by the
present regime in Washington, but of the
failure of the present financial system to
meet "changing needs in a changing econ-
omy." How our economy is changing and
where it is going—these questions are not
answered in any detail. However, it might
be well to ignore theory for the moment
and consider, first, the practicability of
Mr. Berle's scheme.

The RFC and the Federal Reserve
have been lending money to business bor-
rowers for quite some time. In seven years
the total lending of this sort has been only
$218,000,000. These agencies have adver-
tised that they would make loans that the
bankers would not make. But it will be
readily seen that their ability to find risk-
worthy borrowers is limited, for a bank
that lends $218,000,000 in seven years is


not much of a bank. Presumably the Berle
bank would do better. It would find risk-
worthy borrowers such as hospitals. Loans
would also be made to new and growing in-
dustries. Here Mr. Berle mentions a few—
"rayon, steel specialties or knockdown
houses." Some of these enterprises probably
have no difficulty in getting loans now, for
those he has mentioned are among the most
risk-worthy. But the more Berle enumer-
ates of loan prospects, the more he raises
questions of detail. And every proposition,
in detail, can be kicked over, because we
are a skeptical people these days. He does
not, for example, mention loans to makers
of labor-saving machinery. He does not
mention the inevitable row with labor and
subcontractors his bank would risk by
loans to a prefabricated housing enterprise.
He does not mention them because these
skepticisms, in detail, add up to the grand
skepticism which is depression.

Presumably the Berle bank, if it were
to improve on the record of the RFC and
the Federal Reserve, would move to the
tune of a greater faith than that which
characterizes the typical banker's mind.
It would be less concerned with the sordid
item of profit, less hopeful of "breaking
even" on certain deals, and more interested
in "the plain need" of society for this or
that venture with other people's money.
For the more important side of the new
bank's activities would be lending money
to communities at inconsequential rates of
interest.

At the present time, with the excep-
tion of money that the Federal government
gives or lends to communities, the limit of
what a community can do for itself in pub-
lic improvement depends to a great extent
upon the judgments of the bankers,
through whom it is compelled to borrow
money, and upon the judgments of the in-
dividuals who have savings to invest in the
securities of local governments. There is
nothing in the past record of our local
governments to indicate that there is any
limit at all to the appetite of local politi-
cians for money for public improvements.
But they have been limited by the means
I have suggested and by legal debt limita-
tions. And here is the point where Mr.
Berle's faith shows itself at its most efful-
gent. Mr. Berle believes it is possible, by
law, to protect this sort of lending by his
bank against "partisan political adminis-
tration." As though paper protections
could not be circumvented by politicians

and by pressure groups such as the potent
lobby of mayors, social-welfare organiza-
tions, a vast army of reliefers, and a puis-
sant bureaucracy in Washington eager to
stay in power.

So much for some of the practical as-
pects of the scheme. Now, for its theory,
or, rather, its theories. For Berle starts
with two theories. The first is that capital
can be "created" outright through a bank-
ing mechanism; that it is not, as we have
always assumed, created by the savings of
people invested for a productive purpose;
that the banking mechanism can, out of
nothing, "create" new capital substantially
by fiat, by some financial legerdemain
which is not related to savings. And when
one gets to this point in the examination
of the Berle thesis, one is moved to brush
aside all of the verbiage and say that if
this is what the game is, why don't we
print money and hand it out to whatever
applicant can persuade the people in
Washington that it is for, in Mr. Berle's
words, "the plain need" of society, or the
"obvious needs," or the "needs which
everybody recognizes."

The other theory, which Mr. Berle
attributes to John Maynard Keynes, is the
idea that the national income is increased
by about two and a half times the amount
spent on heavy capital production financed
by government funds. Berle indicates that
there are differences of opinion on this
point, and in that difference of opinion I
want to be included on the profoundly
skeptical side, for reasons that space does
not permit me to state here. Certainly the
Keynes theory has never been "demon-
trated," as Mr. Berle says, if I understand
the meaning of the word "demonstrated."
I am unable to see how this plan, if se-
riously attempted, could result in anything
except a new economic system, in which
the motive powers that now drive men "to
scorn delights and live laborious days" are
wiped out and, in their place, is put the
discretion of an omnipotent state. For in-
dividual judgment about the uses of indi-
vidual savings and the employment of risk
capital would be substituted the judgment
of government. This is economic totalitari-
anism.

I think Mr. Berle is to be respected for
the frankness and clarity with which he
has stated this case. If he is correct in his
assumptions that private initiative has
failed, then the next step must be such a
mechanism as he suggests. But the Amer-
ican people, I believe, prefer individual se-
lection not only in the making of their in-
vestments and in the creation of new forms
of business activity, but in the choice of
their legislators and administrators. Since
this is true, they will exercise their selec-
tive prerogative by voting out of power,
root and branch, those officeholders who
have lost faith in the present economic
system. They will give that system another
chance under people who believe in it.
