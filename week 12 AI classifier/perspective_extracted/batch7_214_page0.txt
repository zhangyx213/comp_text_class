**Deterioration in Higher Education**

by RAYMOND MOLEY

COLLEGE commencements remind us
that somehow, somewhere, unprece-
dented masses of students have lived
through the winter. Somehow, they have
been able to put in the prescribed num-
ber of hours in classrooms, laboratories
and libraries. But the shacks and rook-
eries in which many have lived and
studied are only the external marks of
deeper inadequacies. Far more impor-
tant is the loss in competent
teachers and teaching.

In his singularly eloquent
report as president of the
Rockefeller Foundation, Ray-
mond B. Fosdick points out
the effects of the war on the
training of scientific person-
nel. He says:

"Like any procedure which
expends capital resources
without providing means of
replenishing them, the interruption of
advanced training in the basic sciences
seems to cost little at the moment, and
it serves an emergency by releasing
manpower. But it is a policy of despera-
tion which places a crippling mortgage
on the future. It grinds up the seed-corn
of scientific progress in the next genera-
tion to make a day's feed for the war
machine.

"The consequences of this unintelli-
gent policy are now upon us. There is a
serious, even an alarming, shortage of
adequate personnel in almost every
field which requires advanced think-
ing. We have sacrificed the seed-
corn. We have lost a generation."

Two forces have caused "human ero-
sion" on education. One to which Fos-
dick refers was the direct draining away
of promising men and women into the
civilian and military activities of war—
the diversion of human wealth into the
machinery of destruction.

The other force which has so impaired
teaching personnel is that pale mis-
tress of war—inflation. Endowment in-
come has been shrinking, the resources
of possible benefactors have been tax-
logged, while the teaching and research
staff has been trying to square a 1939
income with 1947 prices.

But the failure of colleges to attract
able young instructors may ultimately
have more far-reaching effects.

The career of a college teacher falls
roughly into three stages. First—up to
the age of 30 or thereabouts—is the
period of graduate study, research and
minor teaching jobs. This period will
always be marked by some economic
difficulties, but it can be lived through.
The next period, from say 30 to 45,
is critical. A family is growing up. The
teacher is struggling to get promotions
through the assistant and associate
grades to the final goal—a full profes-
sorship. He must then turn out sound
but unremunerative scholar-
ship to get these promotions.
He is caught in a dilemma. If
he does lecturing or popular
writing to supplement his in-
come, he delays his promo-
tion. But his salary is barely
sufficient to support his fami-
ly in the manner which col-
lege traditions require. His
income is probably somewhat
below that of a bricklayer or
coal miner and far below that of an
automobile factory worker. He is haunt-
ed by the specter of what will happen if
he meets ill health or accident. There
are tragedies in those years—mental
and physical.

LATER, he moves into clearer weather.
He becomes a full professor, per-
haps at the maximum salary. His chil-
dren are grown and launched in life. In
most cases, his pension is assured. He
can breathe more easily, enjoy his work
and expand his area of well-being.

Elder faculty brethren enjoy maxi-
mum salaries up to the date of retire-
ment. In many cases, retirement is not
compulsory, and professors hold on
until three score and ten or more. In
one instance, a dean remarked privately
that his budget was heavily burdened
by maximum salaries, which prevented
increases among the younger teachers.

In light of these circumstances, it
would seem wise for college authorities
to give first and urgent priority to
teachers in the middle years. Provision
might be made to taper off the work
and salaries of professors over 60. Such
semi-retirement would preserve the wis-
dom and experience of older teachers
and make more money available for
those in the earlier critical years.

In any event, the need to attract
young talent was never greater. Mark
Hopkins on one end of a log and a
student on the other were a university.
But Mark Hopkins in 1947 would prob-
ably seek another profession.
