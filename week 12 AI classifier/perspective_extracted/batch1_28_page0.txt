**PERSPECTIVE**

**STATE SELF-SUPPORT**

**BY RAYMOND MOLEY**

The 25 present and prospective Republican governors who will meet on Dec. 9-10 in Colorado Springs might well agree upon two propositions: it is too early to bicker and divide about who will be the GOP Presidential candidate in 1968. But it is not too early to plan how the candidate can be elected. The answer to the question raised is what the governors and their legislators can do to provide good government in their states and local subdivisions.

Having agreed on these points, the governors should go home and work on their state budgets and also consider carefully the fiscal prospects in their state and local governments in the years ahead. A cardinal principle of most Republican leaders, both "liberal" and "conservative," has been a greater participation in and responsibility for meeting needs at the state and local level. Thus Republicans would check the trend toward control by Washington. This, they contend, is keeping faith with the traditional balance between the states and the Federal government decreed by the U.S. Constitution.

The excuse for Federal invasion of the states preached by the Democratic administrations since FDR has been that the states and local communities are unwilling or unable to meet their own responsibilities.

**FACTS AND PROJECTIONS**

The Republican governors might well take a hard look at the facts and re-evaluate that Democratic contention. For there is good evidence now which denies that Democratic claim. The Tax Foundation has just issued the results of a comprehensive, non-partisan study, "Fiscal Outlook for State and Local Government to 1975." This holds, with abundant evidence, that the widely held doubts about the future of the states are not correct. In recent years, the report says, it has been almost commonplace "to assume that all state and local governments are in financial straits." This may be true for some, but not for the majority.

The big rise in state and local expenditures was in the decade 1955-1965. In the next decade the rise in expenditures will be at a slower rate, especially in outlays for education, highways and health and hospitals. The figures that follow are based upon an assumption of a growth rate of 4 per cent in the gross national product and an annual increase of 1.6 per cent in prices. They do not take account of any decline in the quality of services.

In the years 1955-1965 state and local expenditures averaged annually at $75 billion. In 1975 they will be $142 billion, an increase of 89 per cent. But revenues from all sources, including Federal help under present programs, will rise from $74.3 billion to $146.9 billion, an increase of 98 per cent.

**MORE REVENUE, SAME RATES**

In the states and local subdivisions in 1975 there will be a 75 per cent rise of income from existing taxes from the 1965 level.

The major declines in rates of increase will be from 144 per cent in 1955-1965 to 89 per cent in 1965-1975 in education, from 89 per cent to 36 per cent in highways and from 122 per cent to 97 per cent in health and hospitals.

Welfare will rise, but that will not affect the over-all total.

A reason for the relative declines will be a slowing in the rate of population growth, especially in the old and young categories. The number of old-age assistance recipients will decline by 375,000 by 1975 and public-school enrollments will level off by 1970.

Meanwhile, the aggregate tax sources will increase and more revenue can be raised from present rates. Under present Federal programs the payments to the states will rise from $11 billion in 1955 to $30 billion in 1975. These payments are fore-ordained under present programs largely enacted since President Johnson took office. They are the law of the land.

Thus, by prudent management and without new and expensive programs, the 25 governors and their legislatures can provide good and efficient government without important state-local tax increases.

The proposal for a return to the states of a percentage of Federal tax revenues will be an issue in the new Congress. But no one can predict whether it will be adopted.
