**Cheaper TV for Schools**

by Raymond Moley

The immense potential of TV as an educational tool has been recognized for a long time. There is already a considerable use of the medium, and more is planned. Educational television has even attained alphabetical distinction. It is ETV.

This blessing is also a threat. For its use by local school systems is very expensive. And whatever is expensive cries out for the supposedly bottomless purse of Uncle Sam. If Federally subsidized ETV gets established, the public schools of this country will be teaching largely what the U.S. Office of Education provides for them. Centralized control will be a grim fact, despite the repeated expressions of Congressional opinion to the contrary.

That is why an announcement by the Federal Communications Commission on July 31 holds out a brilliant prospect that all schools—public, private, and parochial—may enjoy the benefits of ETV and still retain control of the material which their children are taught.

A news release by the FCC, which is available to any local school system which will write for it, explains the new opportunity in detail which is impossible in this short space.

The new system is a modification and application of a technological process that is in current use in Europe on a small scale. Its application here has been worked out by the engineers of the FCC in cooperation with a private electronic corporation. It has already been tried out experimentally and successfully in a moderately sized school system in New York.

**SIMPLE EQUIPMENT**

The new system, which is called "ETV fixed station multiple address service," will be available on the 1990-2110 Mc/s band. An ordinary school system with units scattered over a radius of 30 to 40 miles would buy a transmitter which will feed out its programs through antenna attached to a central school building. The programs would be picked up by receiver converters by other schools in the system. Then the material would be carried down to schoolrooms and displayed on ordinary receiver sets. The system would permit simultaneous transmission of several different programs. If a greater radius is desired, there can be "repeater translators" to extend the signal further.

The great advantage of this system is its low cost. The ETV systems now in use are of two kinds—ordinary broadcasting and closed circuit. A broadcasting station for ETV now costs an average of $500,000 to purchase and install. A closed-circuit system costs less to install, but it involves a very high cost of maintenance and operation, since it requires the use of telephone cables. The new system would cost only about one-fifth of the original cost of the present broadcasting systems, and servicing it should not run over $25,000 annually.

**SUBSIDY UNNECESSARY**

Thus, it would be within the financial means of many thousands of school or college systems. Each district or system would be the judge of the material used in classrooms. Complete local control would be preserved, and a Federal subsidy would be unnecessary.

Such a subsidy was authorized in a bill which passed Congress in April—$32 million over five years on a matching basis for building the expensive systems of the sort hitherto in use. This would be limited only to public schools and colleges. The appropriations for this have not yet been made. But with the announcement of the new, cheaper system this spending should not be necessary.

As I see the possibilities of the new system, a school organization could select certain teachers with special talents in such subjects as mathematics, English composition, history, or science and extend the influence of unusually good instruction in many classrooms simultaneously. Whatever expands fine talents enriches the education of the students, provides a division of effort among teachers, and gives recognition to exceptional individuals. But it would be possible also for the station to bring in outside program material from commercial and noncommercial broadcasting stations for use in the local classrooms.

The availability of this new system is not only a great breakthrough in educational television but a notable advance in education itself.
