**Britain Stays Right**

by Raymond Moley

BIRMINGHAM—On the eve of the
election I had the opportunity
for a talk with Vaughn Reynolds, edi-
tor of the century-old Birmingham
Post. I was especially impressed by
his views on the sturdy idealism and
common sense of the British elector-
ate. In something he wrote for his
paper, he expressed this idea: "The
paramount issue in the next five years
will be whether Britain can rise above
the issue of the welfare state to a
higher conception of a nation basing
its international influence and its do-
mestic integrity on moral principles."

In my judgment, that is exactly what
the British proved in this election.
At the beginning of the three-week
campaign, there was plenty to induce
apathy, even pessimism. The two
party manifestoes were mainly an
elaboration of the materialistic vote
catchers of the old Liberal Party of
Lloyd George. The Tories said: "We
never had it so good," and the Social-
ists promised more of all for all.

**APPEAL TO IDEALISM**

Labor seized the initiative two
weeks before the election. Hugh
Gaitskell and his co-leaders germi-
nated promises by the hour: More
and more for pensions, housing, medi-
cal and hospital care, and education.
Also, the promise was made that al-
though the income taxes were not to
be increased, the purchase tax on cer-
tain articles would be removed. As
for the added revenue for the millions
of pounds of added expenditures,
Gaitskell said it would come from
more production. This unabashed
nonsense from a professional econo-
mist who was once Chancellor of the
Exchequer disgusted many a former
supporter. It was, in essence, the same
sort of mythical promise exploited by
some American liberal spenders. It is
what the British call "hire purchase"
applied to national fiscal policy. The
voters contemplated the danger of
making the Prime Minister a man who
had descended to the level of an
irresponsible soapbox Socialist. There
was also considered the spectacle of
Aneurin Bevan as their representative
in the councils of nations.

Labor had overreached itself.
Macmillan and other Conservative
leaders, as well as a large part of the
press, countered fiercely. The Prime
Minister refused to make the election
what he called a "mock auction." He
stood on the record of his party. Fi-
nally, in his last broadcast he raised
the campaign high above the ma-
terialistic level of its earlier days and
made a moving appeal to the pride
and idealism of the British people. A
tremendous surge toward the Con-
servatives came in the final days and
hours before election.

**QUESTIONS FACED**

I can conceive of the British
voters, of whom an unprecedented
number had declared themselves to
be uncommitted, asking themselves
whether they wanted these Socialist
leaders to represent them at a time
when the quest for peace will be
pursued. They seem to have asked
themselves whether this preoccupa-
tion with the goods of life properly
befits a nation which seeks the good
of life for themselves and others. In
short, what kind of people do
Gaitskell and Bevan think we are?

While Labor achieved an early ad-
vantage on television with overly slick
shows, interest shifted to the old-
fashioned local gatherings in halls and
schoolhouses, with face-to-face con-
frontation of candidates and plenty of
heckling. I attended some of those
meetings in the Midlands and visited
party offices in Birmingham and Cov-
entry. Candidates, their agents, and
hundreds of volunteers worked in that
last week with incredible energy. The
tide was turned.

It was apparent by 11 on election
night that there was a great swing
to the Conservatives. Even Conserva-
tive Party workers, who expected it
to be close, were amazed. Labor ma-
jorities were lower almost every-
where and many marginal majorities
were swept away.

And so Labor lost its materialistic
bid. Britain has chosen the way of
political and economic freedom.

The great and growing middle
class dominated this election—a class
which was condemned to extinction
by Karl Marx, the prophet of the So-
cialists. It not only has made the
Marxian prediction an absurdity, but
it has repudiated those who would
rule through Marxian principles.
