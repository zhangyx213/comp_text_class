**Keys to Atomic Power—VII**
**THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT**
by Raymond Moley

ALMOST lost amid the hoots and
growls attending the deplorable
and unnecessary conflict between the
Atomic Energy Commission and the
Congressional Joint Committee on
Atomic Energy, a piece of news has
broken in that field which has more
import than anything that has hap-
pened in a long, long time.
The Pacific Gas & Electric Co. has
announced a positive intention to
build at Eureka, Calif., a 60,000 kilo-
watt atomic-power plant. General
Electric and the Bechtel Corp. will be
the building contractors. PG&E will
require no financial assistance from
the government for construction and
no assistance is asked from the AEC
for research and development.
The sensational part of this an-
nouncement is the fact that the com-
pany estimates that the cost of power
from this plant when it is completed
in 1962 will be only 8 mills per kilo-
watt-hour. This will be competitive
with power cost from conventional
sources in that region and in many
other parts of the United States.
In the preparation of this series of
articles I have examined stacks of lit-
erature, hearings, and documents and
have found the consensus of people
in the atomic-power field to be that
competitive power could not be ex-
pected for ten or fifteen years. The
present cost is estimated at something
like 50 mills per kilowatt-hour.

**THERE IS TIME**

The great achievement at Eureka
will be due to advances in the de-
sign, technology, and fueling based
upon a smaller plant built by the
same companies at Vallecitos, Calif.,
under AEC License No. 1 and put
into production last November.
This achievement, together with
the many promising building pro-
grams of other companies and in other
regions, makes it abundantly clear
that any hysterical Federal “crash”
program of building atomic-power
plants would be folly. Such a Federal
program would be unnecessary,
wasteful, and destructive of real prog-
ress. It would be unnecessary be-
cause there is no need now for power
from the atom and will not be for two
decades when demands for electricity
will press upon our resources of coal
and oil. It would be prodigiously
wasteful because we do not yet know
which sort of reactor and what form
of fuel will be the best suited to the
purpose. And any such program
would mean a great Federal monop-
oly mortally inimical to a free econ-
omy. Moreover, progress can, we
know, come from a climate which will
induce investors, large and small, to
supply the funds necessary to meet
the immense needs for electricity in
future years. I mention small investors
especially because they and the peo-
ple who have their funds in trust have
found over the years utility securities
to be unusually safe and productive.

**HOW TO COOPERATE**

There is, however, a very impor-
tant role for our government in the
development of nuclear power. Inter-
national rivalry in atomic electrical
power production is hardly relevant
to this subject since it has little direct
military significance. We do know,
however, that the Russians have only
rudimentary prototypes, and the So-
viets are admittedly behind their own
1956 plans. The British have a plant.
But since they desperately lack con-
ventional fuel they must therefore
pay high costs.
In this country both manufacturers
and utilities have asked for a clarifica-
tion and elaboration of the program
of the AEC. Government emphasis
should be in building small, experi-
mental prototype plants to work to-
ward the discovery of the most
efficient, economical, and safe kind of
reactor. It should invest ever more
heavily in research and technical ex-
perimentation to lengthen fuel life, to
reduce fabrication costs, to reprocess
spent fuel, to delve more deeply into
metallurgy for better and more ap-
propriate construction materials, to
improve reactor design, to dispose of
waste, and eternally to seek the
means for more safety in operation.
With that sort of cooperation from
government, private companies and
investors can build the larger and
more efficient plants to supply the
electric power of the future.
