**Perspective**

**Baruch and Inflation**

*by RAYMOND MOLEY*

WHATEVER may be the pros and
cons of B. M. Baruch's idea
of bringing about total economic mobilization now, the extraordinary fact is that Congress has given the President power measurably to do just that. And Congress did this despite its earlier objection to such power and the President's positive denial of its necessity. This extraordinary reversal of our Executive and Legislative departments, vested as they are with the power of government, was largely due to the influence of one man with no official positionâ€”a man past his 80th year. It may be assumed that the statesmen and politicians who thus changed their minds did not do so because they themselves were convinced that Baruch was right. They did it because Baruch has the confidence of a bewildered citizenry. Americans, whatever their ideological slant, have a profound respect for a man who knows what to do with his money. They also associate Baruch with the economic affairs of two world wars. And since with magnificent caution Baruch for 30 years has avoided the deadly responsibility of office, while maintaining a deserved reputation for wise counsel, he still remains an unimpaired public figure.

It is clear at this moment, despite the brighter news from Korea, that Americans are desperately worried about inflation. Everyone who has either money or imagination to grasp the dangers ahead wants to know what he can do to save what he has. Despite Baruch's vast reputation as an investor and trader, he has no specific advice about what to buy and what to sell. Those who ask him such questions are likely to be told to buy when things are low and to sell them when they are high. This, with an actual or figurative poke in the ribs.

BARUCH'S real answer has been made clear in many ways. He thinks that people cannot save their economic bacon unless government does much more than it has done. He is not satisfied that Congress and the President, despite their action in passing the yes-but controls bill, acted rightly or with sufficient promptitude.

He points out that in the weeks since he advised a general ceiling on prices and wages, several billions have been lost to the taxpayer in higher prices. Millions are ebbing away daily. And people who are talking about a rollback of prices and wages to the happy days of early June should think again. Perhaps the best advice that Baruch could now give to the citizen is what the hard-bitten banker said whom I quoted in this space last week: vote against weak men and for stronger men in our government.

The authentic and complete story of the Baruch saga has not yet appeared. Baruch himself has been at it for years, but either his native caution, his hesitation to express without reservations his views on some of the luminaries whom he has advised, or lack of time has deferred its publication.

A SMALL book, however, has just appeared which makes good reading. It is W. L. White's "Bernard Baruch, Portrait of a Citizen." It tells of Baruch's South Carolina origins, his family, his success as a lone operator in Wall Street, his almost worshipful service for Woodrow Wilson, his contacts with Roosevelt and with the war over which Roosevelt presided, his efforts to domesticate the atom bomb, and his fight for economic controls. Mr. Baruch's friends complain, not without reason, that Mr. White's prejudice against Roosevelt and Wilson somewhat distorts the picture.

But no one can encompass in a small book the amazing career of this civilian who made so much history. The story has too many ramifications, too much subtlety, too much elaboration of policies and decisions which were born in the almost indefinable recesses of the Baruch mentality. For Baruch himself can scarcely rationalize or explain the processes of his judgments. No one has yet defined a hunch, although much of the world's course has been directed by hunches.

What we know is that Baruch has been right in a much larger percentage of cases than is given to many mortals. He has given his time and energy to public service for 30 years. And he is a sterling patriot.
