**PERSPECTIVE**

**A LOOK BEYOND THE WAR**

**BY RAYMOND MOLEY**

Richard Nixon's contribution to the
multilogue on Vietnam looks be-
yond enlisting support for his nomina-
tion, for he is giving his party a foreign
policy fit for all seasons, an asset the
GOP needs as it looks toward 1968.
For this, Republicans should consider
themselves deeply in his debt.
The President will be very hard to
beat in 1968 if the limited objectives
of our military effort are achieved in
the next ten months. In that case LBJ
will emerge as something of a hero
and something of a seer. Pollsters will
revise their popularity ratings, party
critics will subside, Democrats will
unite and loud hosannas will rise from
the populace.
The Republican Party will need a
spokesman who not only is broadly ex-
perienced in foreign affairs but who
has a viable set of views about the Far
Pacific and Asia. This must not only
encompass support for a war which
has cost the United States so much
but look beyond the war to the re-
sponsibilities of the United States.
Any Republican possibility who fa-
vors either our isolation from the per-
imeter of China or the obliteration of
North Vietnam could not possibly pre-
vail against the President, whatever
may happen during the next year.
Among the GOP aspirants, Richard
Nixon is unique in his firsthand, long-
term study of Asia and the Pacific, in
his comprehension of the objectives of
the Communist system and the fears
and hopes and interests of the still
non-Communist countries on the pe-
riphery of eastern Asia.

**NIXON'S EXPERIENCE**

Fourteen years ago, after a mission
in which he visited those places, in-
cluding Hanoi and Saigon, he warned
Americans of the plight of Southeast
Asia and favored some help to the
beleaguered French. Secretary Dul-
les and Joint Chiefs chairman Radford
agreed with him. Radford, except for
MacArthur, was our most experienced
military leader in Asiatic and Pacific
affairs. But the President hesitated,
France withdrew and there emerged
the succession of events which ended
in our armed intervention.
Nixon's position then and now has
been that with the Communist system
-either Russia or China or both-dom-
inant in Southeast Asia, the gateway
to the Indian Ocean would be ex-
posed and all the countries on the per-
imeter, from Japan to Australia and
India, would be menaced by Commu-
nist military aggression and economic
exploitation. That would be the pre-
liminary to World War III.
Nixon's judgment of our present
military effort is that never has so
much power been so ineffectively
used. But if we prevail despite our
mistakes, any settlement must avoid
two extremes. One is a phony neu-
tralization of South Vietnam. The
other is the creation of a vacuum in
North Vietnam, into which Red China
would certainly move. And Russia
would demand compensation for its
present involvement, which has con-
tributed 100 per cent of Hanoi's oil
and 80 per cent of its sophisticated
weapons.

**CANNOT ACCEPT ISOLATION**

But, Nixon says, the foreign policy
of a great power like ours must look
beyond the war to its aftermath. For
war in this instance, as always, is a
temporary crisis in the long processes
of diplomatic policy. Most of our wars
have created problems greater than
those for which we took up arms.
Our sea, air and economic power
impose responsibilities in the long fu-
ture in non-Communist Asia. We can-
not escape this. And safety for the
non-Communist world in the Pacific
will demand new efforts to create mu-
tual interests and mutual aid among
those countries. This would be a sub-
stitute for SEATO, which was virtu-
ally imposed from Europe (which
has now just about abandoned the
Far East) and the United States. In
that postwar era the United States
must provide encouragement, eco-
nomic aid and military protection.
While our stand in Vietnam has done
much to convince those countries that
Communism is not necessarily the
wave of the future, they will need
help for a considerable time. We can-
not accept isolation when our interests
and those of the countries of the free
world are involved.
It is not Communist China alone
that is the great future threat. Rus-
sia, with the mobility of its vast new
maritime strength and its designs for
economic and ideological penetration,
will be a permanent power in the
Pacific. This must be balanced by our
own presence and our own concern
for the protection of the independ-
ence of the countries involved.
Nixon's view of the future should
also be the policy of his party.
