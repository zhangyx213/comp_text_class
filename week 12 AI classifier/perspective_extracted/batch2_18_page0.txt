**PERSPECTIVE**

**BACK TO BOSSISM**

**BY RAYMOND MOLEY**

The powerful dissenting argument of Justice Frankfurter in the first of the reapportionment cases, his last and best opinion, seems to have left a majority of his colleagues unimpressed. For since then, the Court has moved far beyond its original position, holding that both houses of state legislatures must be apportioned on the basis of what is somewhat loosely called "one man, one vote." Wide criticism and the opposition in Congress to this judicial intervention in a political question have not deterred the Court, liberal Democrats and union labor from pressing on for a full application of this representational revolution throughout the nation.

Perhaps the effort to stem the tide relies too heavily upon tradition. For it is impossible to escape the conclusion that in the torrent of reform which has been sweeping the country since the election in 1964, tradition has been rejected as reactionary and benighted. I shall therefore refrain from an appeal to history. The Supreme Court is determined not only to interpret the law, but to create an institutional revolution.

**BALANCE IS NEEDED**

The effect of the sort of representation now decreed by the Court and apparently supported by the pro-Administration majority in Congress will, if successful, subject the legislatures of every big industrial state to control by the major cities. This will be most marked in such states as Illinois, Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and Massachusetts.

Because of the drift of population, great urban masses have a preponderance of the voting strength in their states. If we are to believe that pure democracy is the way to enlightenment, justice and progress, it follows that we shall want these great masses of voters to dominate the legislative bodies of the states, to work their will and promote their interests without check or restraint.

The suggestion of the necessity of countervailing forces to assure deliberation of debate and legislative calm these days may be excoriated by the gentle knights of change. But sober reflections on the motives and habits of people in the mass must tell us of the need for balance.

When power is given without limitation to people in the mass, they do not make their decisions by individual and rational choice. They move as a unit, dominated by their social and economic environment and their leaders. The rule is, as the late Prof. V.O. Key pointed out after a monumental study of polling, that mass opinion represents an "interaction" between what he called "influentials" and the bulk of the people. The people, he said, are moved by their leaders' "cues" and "proposals." Those leaders are the "activists." Thus, what we call the "democratic order" depends upon the beliefs, standards and interests of its leaders.

**DOMINATE STATE CAPITALS**

In the industrial centers the leaders are the political bosses and the labor leaders. The masses are told how to vote, not directly and arbitrarily in all cases, but by clever devices, deluding the minds and emotions of the voters. In short, a great majority in every urban area is controlled.

For more than a century these urban areas were boss controlled. Some still are. But as Federal welfare grew after the middle 1930s, the bosses became mere proconsuls under the Federal establishment which had unlimited funds to supplant the machine's beneficial treasury. This, it seemed, meant the twilight of the boss and the machine. Like Othello, they found their "occupation gone."

Reapportionment, which will throw control of the legislatures to these city machines and unions, will mark a revival of the old order. For in many states the urban organizations, mostly Democratic, will dominate the state capitals. Through control of the legislatures, the urban legislative stooges will next redraw the Congressional districts and thus assure in the House of Representatives a majority capable of perpetuating what we have now.

That is the prospect before us. And unless some constitutional means is devised and enacted to assure some semblance of geographical representation in at least one house of the state legislatures, there may well be indeterminate domination of national affairs by the political and labor leaders in the great cities.
