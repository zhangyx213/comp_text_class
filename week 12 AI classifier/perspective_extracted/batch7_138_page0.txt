5—Billions, Not Millions

HERBERT HOOVER, in asking for
public support for the enact-
ment of his commission’s recommenda-
tions, said: “For you taxpayers to carry
forward this work to ultimate fruition
means billions. It is not millions, it is
billions.”

The very heart of the Hoover report
will be its recommendations
for a complete overhauling
of the financial activities of
the Executive branch of
government. If, as is prob-
able, the final report fol-
lows the sub-reports of the
Hoover “task forces,” it will
recommend that the Treas-
ury Department be reor-
ganized as a real finance
ministry. The Secretary
would become an American Chan-
cellor of the Exchequer. Responsi-
bility would be centered there for
budgeting, for accounting, for debt
management, for the liquidation of
the lending agencies of the govern-
ment, and for the recommendation of
tax policy.

In this series of articles I have
pointed out why there can be no
real saving until the functions of con-
trol are pulled together, freed from
excrescent bureaucracy, frills, and
duplication, rid of antiquated meth-
ods, and shaped into real means of
control. I have illustrated this by
showing the perversion of budgeting,
auditing, and accounting since the
creation of the Budget Bureau and
Comptroller General in 1921.

Preliminary Hoover studies indi-
cate that the Treasury should first be
swept clean of irrelevant activities
such as the Bureau of Supply, the
Coast Guard, the Bureau of Narcotics,
and the Secret Service—these to go to
other departments.

The Budget Bureau should be re-
moved from the President’s office and
lodged in the Treasury. It should then
be stripped down to a small, powerful
agency built along functional lines.
It should be headed by a man of
large caliber, capable of dealing force-
fully with the voracious demands of
other departments.

Revenue services in the Treasury
should be consolidated, with modern,
simplified statistical and accounting
methods.

Fiscal services such as the care and
disbursement of funds, debt manage-
ment, and the like should also be con-
solidated and modernized.

Then there should be consolidated
in the Treasury the accounting service
of the Executive branch of the gov-
ernment, under an Accountant Gen-
eral, with an adequate sal-
ary and a long fixed term of
perhaps fifteen years. Ac-
counting should then be
modernized along lines now
followed in the best business
practice. Literally freight-
car loads of vouchers are
now hauled from the de-
partments to the Comptrol-
ler General’s office and
thousands of workers are
employed in checking them. This
work, directed from the Treasury,
should be done in the departments
where the expenditures are made.
Thus, the President through an Ac-
countant General in the Treasury
would direct the accounting, which is
not a proper concern of Congress.

Freed of accounting functions, the
Comptroller General should be a real
auditing and investigating arm of Con-
gress, which is, as I have pointed out,
our board of directors.

It should be added that the Hoover
task force on the General Accounting
Office report consists of most distin-
guished accountants, and they were
unanimous in these recommendations.

The way to reform will be difficult.
Vast selfish interests in Congress
and in the bureaus are involved. The
Comptroller General, Lindsay C. War-
ren, has already objected to the reform
of his office. He is quoted as saying
that the plan of the Hoover task force
is “an attempt to keep from the Con-
gress and the people information as to
how the taxpayers’ money is being
spent.” This is directly contrary to
fact. To free the Comptroller General
to audit and investigate is to provide
a critical need of Congress and the
people.

But only a powerful public opinion
backed by strong Presidential pressure
can push through the reforms sug-
gested, which are in their essence the
only means of relieving the taxpayer.
