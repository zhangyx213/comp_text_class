**PERSPECTIVE**

**WHO'S REALLY FOR LBJ?**

**BY RAYMOND MOLEY**

Last week I found it necessary to
part with a bad tooth. After the
Novocain had been administered,
there was that dread pause while
the stuff was performing its merciful
mission of insensibility and before the
short pull (euphemistically called the
"evulsion"). In that waiting moment
the dentist asked: "You don't think
Goldwater can win, do you?"
My muffled plea was that politics
be adjourned during the emergency.
But it seems that most of the peo-
ple with whom I have had contacts
during the past months begin the
inquisition with some such comment
as: "I am a Republican but I can't
vote for Goldwater."
After I have replied with some-
thing to the effect that I don't con-
sider the Republican candidate to be
dangerous but a very refreshing in-
dividual who is raising questions
which have needed to be asked for
many years, my respondents have
raised eyebrows and show a faraway
look in their eyes.
And so I have resolved to counter
such provocative questions with this
response: "Just why are you voting
for the Johnson-Humphrey ticket?" I
anticipate that the conversation will
then turn to the World Series, pro-
fessional football, the Warren report,
or the weather.

**NO POINTING WITH PRIDE**

This campaign is not a dialogue
but a monologue. Even those who
are paid to inform and enlighten pub-
lic opinion, including some of the
newspapers which have switched
their traditional allegiance, dedicate
their discourse to the challenger
rather than the champion. The Presi-
dent himself seems unwilling to stand
on the record, probably because that
would require him to share the credit
with his predecessor, who originated
most of the legislative measures he
has supported. Instead of pointing
with pride, he seems satisfied with
hurling contemptuous characteriza-
tions at an opponent whom he never
mentions by name and also with rail-
ing at extremism, which he never
seems willing to define.
Is this negative tone due to the
fact that the Johnson supporters are
ashamed of their candidate? If they
are willing to give over the conduct

of the republic's affairs to the Presi-
dent and his prospective heir ap-
parent, they should in this campaign
be asked a considerable number of
pertinent questions.
It is no secret that in and around
Washington, even within the White
House coterie, people who were gen-
uinely attracted by JFK have limited
respect, not to say a rather contemp-
tuous attitude toward his successor.
They don't enjoy his ear-shattering
shouting. They don't attempt to de-
fend Mr. Johnson's wheeling and
dealing with vital issues, his tolerance
for the ethics of his intimates, his
zigzag voting record in the Senate,
his crude philosophy of government,
his reckless willingness to gamble
with the credit of the United States
through half-baked handouts, his
blind belief that he can compromise
irreconcilable interests at home, and
his irrational faith that he can resolve
the cold war with platitudes. And so
they devote their attention almost en-
tirely to abuse of Goldwater.

**GOLDWATER'S QUESTIONS**

They scream when Goldwater sug-
gests an examination and revalua-
tion of the social-security system,
which though properly conceived in
the beginning will sometime founder
with the weight of what has been
and may be imposed upon it. Now
that prosperity blesses the Tennessee
Valley, what is wrong about returning
some of the functions of the TVA to
the Federal departments in Washing-
ton where they belong? If a Ken-
nedy-Johnson tax cut was right in
1964, what is wrong with progres-
sive cuts based upon economies in
civil expenditures? Must we go on for-
ever with the no-win policies abroad
which began when Democratic Ad-
ministrations surrendered the fruits of
victory in Europe, gave China to the
Communists, and frustrated MacAr-
thur's plan to win the war in Korea?
These are some of the vital ques-
tions Goldwater has raised, questions
which the national interest demands.
There are no answers. Only the tire-
some reiteration that the country
must be saved from Goldwater. But
it will be to his everlasting credit that
he has raised them, with a singular
disregard of their political conse-
quences to his own fortunes.
