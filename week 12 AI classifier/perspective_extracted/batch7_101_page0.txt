**An Atomic Balance of Power**

**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

SINCE major news these days is divided between the drive for pensions and the Russian atomic explosion, it might be noted that the more uncertain the future becomes, the more we are anxious to provide for it.

This may be what our intelligentsia likes to call an unrealistic point of view, but it reflects the apparent lack of serious concern on the part of the public over the towering change in the world outlook because of the prospect of a two-sided atomic war. Some of us felt, four years ago, that we should reorient our thinking because of the atom. But both civilian and official thinking has undergone little change. Perhaps that was because we felt so secure behind our monopoly of the bomb. Now we have received the second call. When and if the third call comes, it will be too late to think.

It has been interesting to note the various reactions of our leaders of opinion on this new factor. One is that we are far ahead in the race and can keep ahead. But we can hardly rest securely upon any such assumption. It is too indefinite as to time and quantity. We cannot tell how long our superiority will deter Russia from precipitating war. Nor can we know that we are ahead. Moreover, a race in production would impose a crushing burden of expense, would involve the further regimentation of industry, and would defer indefinitely the hope of peaceful uses of atomic power.

The belief that we can buy security merely by arming Western Europe is vain. We are giving the North Atlantic nations pitifully small defense against a Russia armed with the bomb. Nor could we count upon any country except Britain to resist such an attack. In any event, this news will no doubt alter fundamentally the specific uses to which our military-aid money will be assigned.

We come, finally, to control by international agreement, which is the most intelligent basis of constructive action. It should be noted, however, that the adoption of any form of effective control will be the result rather than the cause of assured peace. It has been clear all along that neither Russia nor the United States will throw away any decisive advantage because of the promises of one or the other. There must be some overwhelming advantage apparent to both sides that will best be preserved by continuing peace.

It may be that general peace may be nearer when the atomic secret is no longer a secret. History has a lesson or two that may be worth noting. In general, long periods of peace have been attained by one of two conditions. First, there has been a situation in which one power held its neighbors under complete control. That was the Roman peace. The other has been a situation where contending forces have been so evenly matched and intermeshed that neither could find it profitable to precipitate war. That has been called a balance of power. During the many years of Bismarck's ascendancy that was the situation between Germany and Russia. Such a peace is deeply rooted in self-interest. It has none of the elements of idealism. It is materialistic, but it has worked.

Perhaps that is the best hope in the present situation.

On the basis of such a balance of power, there should be no complacency. We must, until matters clear, take every precaution. We must arrange our defenses so that we should in war suffer the least, and mobilize our striking forces so that our enemy would suffer the most.

AND since we must oppose ideology as well as arms, we must contain Communism by raising the economic standards of all nations on the vast periphery of Russiaâ€”in Europe, in the Near East, in India, and in Japan. Notably, we must do what we can to restore the peaceful power of Germany, whose hatred of Russia is undying and unmeasured.

With peace as our objective, we must present the prospect of unprofitable aggression. Then we may have some assurance of the slow creation of peaceful relations with Russia and its uneasy satellites.
