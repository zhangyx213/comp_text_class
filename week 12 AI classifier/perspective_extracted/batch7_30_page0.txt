**Peril Point for Business**

**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

IN MANY ways, the problems of this industrial mobilization are like those of 1940-41 and of 1916-17, and business management will profit from the earlier experiences. But in two very important respects, the present situation and prospect are radically different, and wise management will or should give earnest attention to the development of means of avoiding two perils that lie ahead.

One of these differences is the fact that we are already in a fast-running tide of inflation. The other mobilizations began in periods of normal or subnormal employment and prices.

The other and still more important difference is that we are mobilizing for the purpose of avoiding, rather than participating in a war. In the other instances a fierce conflict was raging whose voracious appetite consumed as fast as we could produce.

Unless we prepare to protect our business from the dangers inherent in these factors, we may precipitate the very economic collapse that Soviet policy so fondly anticipates.


WHEN the Korean war stirred the job of ordering a full measure of war materials, we were already in a dangerous inflation. Employment was at a very high point, and prices had been rising for years. Moreover, the Federal Administration was covertly fueling the fire while it piously deplored it. All of the real accelerators of inflation were in operation—encouragement for higher wages, vast government spending for the welfare state and foreign aid, government bounties like the veterans’ bonuses, and artificially maintained low rates of interest. Now, since the additional accelerator of big war orders has been added, the Administration resists any effort to make money scarcer, opens the way for more wage increases, and recklessly asks for more spending on nonessentials. The show of price and wage controls is a silly, feeble, insincere gesture.

Next to a curtailment of the money supply, the soundest means of checking inflation is to coax consumers’ dollars into goods which are not scarce or needful of the stuff essential for war materials. To invent, discover, or improvise such goods is a major responsibility of business management. This means that management must keep research in action and imagination alive. It also means that management must whet a consumer want for those things by strong advertising and sales effort.

The second, more serious peril lies ahead a year and a half or two years, when military goals are reached or are approaching their peak. It is a fair assumption that these goals can be reached at some moment short of the approximate three years that it required in the late war. We are starting, this time, with more equipment for manufacturing and with vastly more experience.

Hence, an estimate of not more than two years to do what we did before in three or more years.

But this is a drive for the prevention of, not participation in a war. Suppose the Soviet is smart enough to avoid all-out war and with cold deliberation watches us rush on pell mell. Every statement by Stalin and every treatise by Soviet economists indicate that the Russian master plan is to wait for an economic crash over here before the military die is cast.

This means that business management must not only give what it can to war production, but must keep its mind at the same time on the moment, not so long ahead, when civilian production and sales must take up the inevitable slack. For the tension of no-peace, no-war may last from ten to twenty years.

THERE will not be the great civilian deficiencies that we had in 1945, for the time of denial will be half as long. The replacement of military supplies will occupy only a fraction of our capacity. Again, this means industrial planning, research, and readiness for the production and sale of new products. And it means keeping the names of producers before the public, the developing of civilian desires for new products, and the maintenance of sales forces at a high standard of efficiency.

The old saying “in time of peace prepare for war” should now read, “in this mobilization prepare also for no-peace, no-war.”
