**Perspective**

**The Supreme Court on the Job**

**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

Chief Justice Stone deserves the
gratitude of Americans for his prompt
action in calling the Supreme Court to
consider the issues involved in the
saboteur trial. For the consideration
the court has given this case will set
a pattern of justice at home in the
dangerous days ahead.

War, with its burning excitements
and its need for quick action, almost
always threatens the traditional stand-
ards of law and freedom. Only the in-
curably optimistic will hesitate to face
the fact that this war and its aftermath
could present such internal challenges.
That is what has made the Supreme
Court’s action in the saboteur case
momentous to every American.

By the mere facts of finding that
the President was “authorized” to order
the saboteurs tried before a military
commission, that “the military com-
mission was lawfully constituted,” and
that the saboteurs were “held in lawful
custody,” the court reaffirmed, by im-
plication, its right to pass upon the
validity of procedures of the President
and military authorities in such cases.

Only less significant than this is
the fact that the Attorney General
suggested in his argument last week that
the court could decide the saboteur
case, “without touching a hair of the
Milligan case.” Though the court’s writ-
ten opinion has not yet appeared, this
suggestion from the Attorney General
bespeaks a profoundly healthy attitude
on the part of the executive branch of
our government toward a decision which
Justice Jackson described last week as
a “landmark in American liberty.” If
the court does touch the Milligan case,
it is hoped that the trim will be very
sparing.

Milligan, with others, had been tried
in 1864 by a military commission in
Indiana and sentenced to death. He
had been a member of an organization
called the Sons of Liberty, which figured
in a hot gubernatorial election in Indiana
in 1864. Lincoln, according to his secre-
taries, Nicolay and Hay, viewed the
Sons of Liberty with “good-humored
contempt.” “Nothing,” he said, “can
make me believe that one hundred
thousand Indiana Democrats are dis-
loyal.” The military commission had
obviously thought otherwise in Milli-

gan’s case, at any rate. After it had
sentenced Milligan, however, Lincoln
took no action to enforce the sentence.
There the matter stood until Lincoln’s
death. In the terrific excitement follow-
ing Lincoln’s assassination, President
Johnson approved the sentence. Prepara-
tions were made to hang Milligan. At
this point, Supreme Court Justice Davis,
an old friend of Lincoln, used his influ-
ence to persuade President Johnson to
commute the sentence.

So Milligan remained alive, and, a
year later, the Supreme Court heard
arguments on the questions of law
governing the granting to him of a writ
of habeas corpus. The case was argued in
May 1866. The decision was handed
down in December. It was a 5-4 de-
cision.

The majority decision needs to be re-
called in the light of those troubled
times. The war was over; but a dema-
gogic leadership in Congress was bent
on keeping the South under military
rule. Ineffectively, the President was try-
ing to combat that leadership. Reason-
able people had been shocked by the
brutality of the trial of Mrs. Surratt,
Dr. Mudd and the others. The great
issue was whether the ways of peace
should be resumed after years of fra-
ternal war. The court’s majority held
that neither the President nor Congress
had the power to institute a military
commission except in the actual theater
of war and in places where war or in-
vasion had actually closed the civil
courts. This was a very sweeping de-
cision. The minority of the court, speak-
ing through Chief Justice Chase, dis-
sented in part. But Chase, too, held
that “Where peace exists the laws of
peace must prevail.” And as we look
back at it now, it is clear that Chase’s
minority opinion would be the better
law for both war and peace.

The present court might well adopt
the sounder judgment of Chase. For
those views, if adopted, in the forth-
coming opinion of the court, would
permit Congress to perfect present laws
against sabotage without endangering
the civil liberties of Americans.

These eight saboteurs are not Milli-
gans. Their purpose was military; his
was political. Therein lies a distinction
of immense importance.
