**The Delegates Take Over**

**by Raymond Moley**

The public, at the most a shadowy
matter in a campaign for a Presidential nomination, now fades away. The sovereign delegates take over.

Most of the delegates are bound by commitments either to the voters who selected them or to a convention or by their own pledged word. But a considerable number, perhaps 100, are uncommitted and unpledged. To these free agents will be added perhaps another hundred after their formal participation in the first ballot.

These 200 will probably bear the solemn responsibility that may affect the future history of the nation. These men and women are in the main experienced politicians. They are also for the most part conscientious individuals who love their country. The elements that they must consider in making their decisions have to do not only with the success or failure of their party at the November election but with the broad interests of their country. But unless the man they choose can be elected, he certainly cannot serve the country. Hence these men will review very carefully the relative advantages and disadvantages of Taft and Eisenhower in the campaign that lies beyond the convention.

They will recognize as practical politicians that the Eisenhower cause slipped badly after the general's return. For this Eisenhower was mostly innocent. It was due to chaotic, incompetent management. But the failure of his staff work must raise doubts about the general's capacity to organize the election campaign.

Among the most serious shortcomings in his strategy has been a tendency to chip away the impact of his own statements by denials and qualifications. A great many people of a conservative turn of mind were greatly encouraged by the general's first press conferences. But subsequent qualifications of these statements have caused a lot of people to doubt. That doubt has partly been eliminated by his Denver speech on June 26. A fourfold rule that I have learned from the best politicians that I have ever known is that in the heat of a campaign a candidate should never defend, apologize, qualify, or recant. Moreover the general's speech on foreign policy followed the fatal line of attacking not Democrats but Republicans. Vast numbers of Americans, as evidenced by the tremendous vote for Knowland in California, want to punish the party that brought us to the tragic pass in which we find ourselves.

Meanwhile there have been factors to cause the independent delegate to withhold his support from Taft. Anything that suggests a ruthless use of the convention machinery to seat delegates whose qualifications are doubtful will do so. After all the talk about Texas I am still convinced by what I saw there that a majority of that delegation belongs to Eisenhower. The memory of any strong-arm tactics will linger and drive votes away from Taft if he is nominated.

There is also the fact that delegates will be swayed by the widespread belief, carefully cultivated by Taft's enemies, that he cannot be elected if nominated. This is what should be called a factor rather than a fact. I personally believe that Taft can be elected but I also recognize that a great many people do not so believe. And in politics it is what people think rather than what is that counts most.

Some substance for this belief is to be found in the fact that Eisenhower could carry the great State of Texas while Taft probably could not. On the other hand, Eisenhower would have hard going in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and possibly Wisconsin. But Taft would have serious troubles in New York and New England.

At this moment the chance of a deadlock is not great. Deadlocks have in former conventions taken place when there are three or more candidates with sizable blocks of votes as in 1920 and 1940. That is not true this year.

In such a picture no one can make a prediction honestly or intelligently. But this I know. No matter who is nominated, he can be elected if people of capacity and influence work hard enough to get out the right vote. And even the reincarnation of Abraham Lincoln would lose with an incompetent, lazy party behind him.
