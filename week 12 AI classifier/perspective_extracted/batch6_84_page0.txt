New Acres for Old

by Raymond Moley

IN THE President's State of the Union
message, separated by only a few
sentences are two recommendations:
"I shall urge authorization of a soil-
bank program to alleviate the problem
of diverted acres and an overextended
agricultural plant..." and "I strongly
recommend that action be taken at
this session on such wholly Federal
projects as the Colorado River storage
project and the Fryingpan-
Arkansas project..."

This means that the Presi-
dent is asking Congress to
take out of cultivation an
immense number of acres at
a large cost per acre to the
taxpayers, and on the other
hand to bring into cultiva-
tion or to increase the pro-
ductivity of over a million
acres at a cost in the Upper
Colorado project of as high as $5,000
an acre and in the Fryingpan-Arkansas
project of about $1,400 an acre.

This continues the mad cycle which
has been going on for years: The Ag-
riculture Department laboring to curb
production, and the Interior Depart-
ment just as zealously trying to in-
crease production. Of course, this
makes no sense. But lots of things in
politics make no sense and are paid out
of the sweat of the taxpayer's brow.

Nearly two years ago, when the
gigantic Upper Colorado project was
presented to Congress by the Admin-
istration and the Hoover commission
was setting to work to look into all and
sundry "water conservation" projects,
the President appointed a committee
on the general subject, composed
of Secretary McKay, chairman, and
the Secretaries Benson and Wilson.
This committee has just submitted
its report.

In the first place, the report recom-
mends that state and local govern-
ments should share the cost of water
projects. But the President in his mes-
sage recommends that the two projects
named above be "wholly Federal."

Next, the committee recommends
that there be set up "an independent
Board of Review... to analyze the
engineering and economic feasibility
of projects and report to the Presi-
dent." If any such board were to re-
port independently and factually on
these two projects, it can be taken for
granted that no President would
dream of recommending them. As it
happened, the pressure for these proj-
ects came from interested members of
Congress and bureaucrats anxious to
spend more and more tax dollars. The
Congressional committees that con-
sidered them are stacked with mem-
bers from the beneficiary states. In
the case of the bill which passed the
Senate last year (S.500), only one
member came from east of
the Mississippi, and he rep-
resents a state paying a
relatively small percentage
of the taxes involved. One
might as well have a plaintiff
pick the jury which would
pass upon his claim.

The other notable recom-
mendation is that while the
old practice of charging wa-
ter users on irrigation proj-
ects no interest on the money
advanced by the Federal government
should be continued, nevertheless in-
terest should "be shown clearly as a
Federal cost." This means that when a
project is presented to Congress, all
the cards would be laid on the table.
Hitherto the interest charge has been
one of those things that the interested
parties never chose to mention. Only
occasionally a stalwart champion of
economy has pried that cost out of the
Bureau of Reclamation.

That interest charge is very impor-
tant. Since no project except one or
two has been paid for by the water
users within the 53 years since Fed-
eral irrigation began, the interest
charge runs to twice to three times
the original cost.

IMMEDIATELY after the President
made the report public, a congress-
man from Colorado, Wayne N.
Aspinall, shouted his disapproval and
in so doing let a cat as big as a moun-
tain puma out of the bag. He said that
"if they did not favor the elimination
of the interest charge immediately
after adding it to the cost of construc-
tion, there wouldn't be a reclamation
project in the United States that
would be economically possible."

In short, if the real cost plus interest
were considered, none of the pres-
ently proposed irrigation projects
would stand scrutiny.

That is exactly what I have been
saying in this space for two years.
