**Perspective**
**Armed Forces Day 1961**
by Raymond Moley

TONIGHT as you go to bed you may relax knowing that other Americans are carrying out orders. Some are on simulated missions from SAC bases and carriers. Some patrol distant free-world borders. Some sweat in the engine rooms of ships. Some are on station beneath the surface of the sea. And half a world away, there are some who show men of other countries how to assemble a machine gun or set an ambush. Armed Forces Day 1961 emphasizes the military's role "in safeguarding peace and freedom throughout the world." These men, their leaders, and the men and women who support their readiness have demonstrated a mastery of exacting disciplines.

Yet this is an uneasy time. An invasion, supported by the United States, was recently wiped out. Equipment lies on the bottom off a Cuban beach and is scattered in a swamp bordering a narrow road. Communism parades captives in Havana.

A grave question arises. What is the position of our military leaders under the bureaucracy that launched the venture? Although folds of secrecy cloak our Joint Chiefs of Staff, we can draw some alarming conclusions. It is inconceivable that the JCS were a party to such an unrealistic plan. Obviously, their professional skills were not used. A battalion of Marines would not have been sent ashore in the Bay of Pigs without support.

**CIVILIAN BLANKET**
Constitutionally, civilians determine policies. In the past, military strategy and tactics have been determined largely by the military. But, in truth, we no longer have the superb organization that gained an unbroken series of victories in World War II. Our best military minds are stifled under an amorphous, civilian mass crowned by a monolithic civilian authority. Whereas enormous and diverse operations were directed by the JCS, who commanded their services, and by unified commands from the South Pacific to Europe—whereas Admiral Leahy coordinated military efforts, and service secretaries administered the departments—today a bureaucracy has destroyed this proven arrangement. This, in the name of unification, economy, and civilian control and in the hope that a "single strategic concept" would meet future threats.

Humility is not a hallmark of bureaucracy. Through a long series of reorganization acts the Secretary of Defense now has unequivocal control of the military establishment. He no longer "coordinates"; he "directs and commands." Under his immediate charge is a thick civilian layer of functionaries—about 3,000 people responsible to the Deputy Secretary, seven Assistant Secretaries, and the Director of Research and Engineering. "Functionalization" is a password in the corridors of the Pentagon.

The secretaries of the services have been eliminated from the National Security Council.

**MILITARY SNARL**
The powers of the JCS chairman have been enormously enlarged. We have come a long way toward the Chief-of-Staff concept with a large, disciplined General Staff—a vertical system used by the defeated powers of the last war.

The proven virtue of having the military commander who does the planning at the top carry out the plan has been discarded. Any requirement or project is subject to tortuous civilian review. Defense Department boards and committees, possessing a negative rather than a positive supervision, are a tremendous hurdle. This bureaucratic insulation is made more impervious by another civilian blanket. Advisers drawn from the Harvard Yard and MIT who have been deemed expert in military matters surround the President, thus nullifying to a great extent the concept that the JCS are the military advisers of the President. Professors were to have brought to the President "sense of history." Instead, history is misread. Theories replace experience and proficiency.

Kremlin tactics have dispelled the idea that a GI or Marine might never again have to aim in anger down the barrel of a rifle. Only flexibility in our armed forces can meet varied threats. A recognition of our military chiefs' reliability and responsibility will take us out of the fog into which our defense organization has drifted.
