**Rebel From Wisconsin**

**by Raymond Moley**

The labor of two talented and devoted women over a period of 30-odd years has given us the most stimulating and perhaps the most important political book of the year and, it may be, of several years. It is the life of Robert Marion La Follette, written in part by the senator’s widow, Belle Case La Follette, and in part by his daughter, Fola. The book is bound to arouse emotions — a violent, although long-slumbering rancor against a man who defied the interests and prejudices of a very considerable part of the nation; and on the other hand the warm, friendly allegiance of millions.

Among those who grew to maturity in those years when “Old Bob” was on the national scene this book awakens memories of events and political issues which created lifelong habits of mind and political principles. For a considerable number of us who have regretted the perversion of progressivism in these later years, this book once more recalls the integrity and vision with which that movement started. “Old Bob” would have been a massive figure in any generation. But his antecedents and special capacities gave him special eminence on the background of a nation whose political and economic morality had failed to keep pace with its lusty and ruthless material growth. In those days beginning in 1880, when this young man, less than a year out of college, was running for district attorney in Dane County, Wis., there were evils and abuses in and by what one writer called “our resplendent plutocracy.” As La Follette contended then and for decades afterward, political life was corrupt and callous, and political leadership was shamefully indifferent to economic injustice. La Follette dedicated himself to the task of doing something about such conditions. La Follette’s rise was meteoric. At 28 he was a member of the House of Representatives. He entered the Senate in 1906 and remained there until his death in 1925. His son, “Young Bob,” succeeded him and held the seat 22 more years. Thus, over a period of 41 years, the name La Follette stood high in public interest and in impact on the

Senate of the United States. The other son, Philip, served six years as governor of Wisconsin.

“Old Bob’s” early labors in Wisconsin were those of a reformer. He sought and, to a degree, succeeded in purging the political life of his state of corrupt alliances between business and politics. He built a pattern of regulation designed to prevent such alliances in the future.

Because of those achievements he seemed in 1912 the quite appropriate leader of the progressive wing of the Republican Party. But amid dramatic events which in perspective lend neither dignity nor luster to his opponents, he was shoved aside and T.R. took over.

A sympathetic bond with Woodrow Wilson was created in the early years of the new Administration. But with fierce consistency he took Wilson’s professions of neutrality toward the war in Europe at face value. When Wilson took steps down the road to war, La Follette fought him with incredible energy. For his opposition to the war La Follette was subjected to as ruthless and intemperate an attack as this nation has ever seen. But he drove ahead and in the next crisis fought with Borah, Lodge, and others against Wilson’s Treaty of Versailles. Finally, in 1924 he broke entirely with the Republican Party and ran as a progressive independent.

Those neophytes who now see something extraordinary in a Senator quarreling with a President of his own party should read these volumes about this irreconcilable man from Wisconsin. He opposed Taft, Wilson, and Coolidge, and his son fought Hoover. A senator of the United States has a solemn duty to stand foursquare with what he conceives to be the right and with the sentiments of his state. The voters of his state are his judge and his only judge. If his conception of the right fails to meet their test, he can be retired. He need be no mere President’s follower on any issue at any time.

That is as the Constitution decreed. It was and is intended to be our shield against the concentration of power in government.
