Water, Land, and Bookkeeping

by Raymond Moley

THE Upper Colorado Project, an
enormous and costly power and
irrigation plan, has received the ap-
proval of the President, his Budget
Director, and his Interior Department
and is now before Congress for au-
thorization. Strong opposition from
House members from big taxpaying
states is already evident. But the new
Administration supports it despite its
pledges of economy, de-
clared preference for pri-
vate and local development
of natural resources, and its
opposition to extravagant
agricultural subsidies.

Perhaps the Administra-
tion has been forced to
yield partly because of the
pressure of at least ten sena-
tors and a flock of governors,
most of whom are Republi-
cans from the beneficiary states,
claimed. The estimated construction
cost of these would be more than
$300 million.

All this looks wonderful on a map
with nice green patches for blooming
desert and yellow lines to show dams.
The mind's eye can, with the help of
some Senatorial eloquence, supply vi-
sions of happy farmers (and voters)
amid lush, blooming fields.

It is in the dull black and red fig-
ures in the cost sheets that the real
shock lies. For the Lord gives the land
and the water, but the government
keeps the books.

It should be explained that there is
no intention to use the impounded
water in the Glen Canyon and Echo
Park lakes for irrigation. The relation-
ship between the power dams and
the irrigation patches is primarily fi-
nancial. The profits from the sale of
electric power will, under a subtly
contrived bookkeeping plan called
the Collbran formula, provide the sub-
sidy for the irrigation. But the gener-
ality of the American taxpayers will
make up that subsidy over the years
by paying interest on the investment.
Good estimates have it that the sub-
sidy for an acre will be several times
its economic value.

TO EXPLAIN fully the complexities of
this cost-accounting would require
a sizable book. But in another piece
in a week or so I shall attempt to
show briefly what this project will
cost us and our posterity.
