**PERSPECTIVE**

**THE MORRISSEY CASE**

**BY RAYMOND MOLEY**

The quality of law can rise no higher than the conscience and competence of the lawmakers. But in the application and interpretation of law the judges on our courts are the individual's assurance of justice. For the judges must protect good men against bad laws and impose good laws upon bad men. There is an old aphorism that says: "If justice be thy shield and it be broken, whence cometh thy succour?"

The authority which can provide that shield against abuse lies with those who have a part in selecting the judges. This is what we must consider when we determine how the attempt to elevate Francis X. Morrissey to the Federal court came about:

Nothing in Morrissey himself suggests any inward reluctance to aspire to this office for which he had no qualifications. Neither his education nor his experience has exposed him to the honored traditions of the bench. His life in politics taught him a code which says that whatever one can get by the use of money or influence is deserved. And in that career, backed by Kennedy money and influence, there has no doubt grown a conviction that professional esteem and the respect of colleagues are the inventions of visionary nobodies. This callous defense is sufficient to provide insulation from the contempt of the lawyers who appear before a judge and the distrust of colleagues on the bench. The chief judge of the Boston Federal court, Charles E. Wyzanski, objected to the proposed appointment, saying that Morrissey "has neitherâ€¦ familiarity with the law nor the industry to learn it."


**SORENSEN'S OPINION**

Next, there has been the cynicism of the members of the Kennedy family who first promoted this appointment. It began with the use which the father, Joseph P. Kennedy, made of Morrissey's special talents. No doubt, the source of this nomination was in the elder Kennedy's order that this high judicial honor be bestowed upon one who was called "Old Joe's eyes and ears." The father selected Morrissey to deal with the management of young JFK's first campaign for Congress. Morrissey was even then regarded by the Ivy League "intellectuals" in the campaign as something to be tolerated but not respected.

When in 1961 all seemed ready for Morrissey's appointment by the new President, JFK seemed to hesitate, perhaps because he knew so well how the fury of dissent would tarnish his image. But after the assassination the two brothers, Robert and Edward, were less concerned with images than with exploiting their new power. Apparently they had the means of persuading the new President and also Speaker McCormack that the nomination must be made.

Here there should be recorded the appraisal of Morrissey by the man closest to the late President, Theodore C. Sorensen. In his book, "Kennedy," Sorensen characterizes Morrissey in terms so harsh that I hesitate to quote them in full. Morrissey was, to use Sorensen's less severe nouns, a "buffer" and a "pol" of the Kennedys.


**A PRIVATE OBLIGATION**

The service of Morrissey was a private obligation which should have been acquitted by private means, such as a million dollars or the management of the Kennedy charities. But with the arrogance which regards public office as a means of paying private debts, the price was deemed to be a public office of distinction and influence.

Contagious cynicism spread to the senators in the Judiciary Committee who voted to confirm: Eastland, Burdick, Dodd, Kennedy of Massachusetts, Hart and Smathers. Those who opposed Morrissey's confirmation deserve honorable mention: Dirksen, Ervin, Scott and Javits.

Those who wish to temper the condemnation of the President for making the choice say that he expected the storm of protest and believed that this would embarrass the Kennedys rather than himself. But this is a tribute to political trickery. Another excuse is that the President was unaware of the facts. But he should have known the facts before he acted. Lack of qualifications was quite obvious. All this does not temper the judgment that the ultimate in cynicism was in the man who sent the nomination to the Senate.
