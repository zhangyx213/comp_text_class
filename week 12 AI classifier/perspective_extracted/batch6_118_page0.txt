**A Hope and a Prayer**
by Raymond Moley

LONDONâ€”As I looked forward to this
election I entertained a hope and
a prayer. The former was that the
Conservatives would win. The latter
had to do with the strength of their
majority. My hope has been fulfilled
and I believe that my prayer has
been answered.

The case for a Conservative victory
seemed to be conclusive. While there
have been few plaudits for
Churchill since the election,
he deserves great credit for
the revival of Conservatism
since the war. He enforced
competence, restraint, and
a fine consideration for hu-
man values in domestic af-
fairs, and a fair spirit of
cooperation with the United
States in world affairs. He
filled important party posts
with such excellent statesmen as
Eden, Butler, Macmillan, and many
other younger men and women.
Maxwell Fyfe now Viscount Kilmuir,
was put to work at reorganizing the
party after the great defeat in 1945.
And it was Churchill who put a fine
administrator, Viscount Woolton, in
charge of party machinery. These
steps are largely responsible for the
revival which apparently began be-
fore 1950. The reconstructed Con-
servative Party has the competence,
energy, and imagination to rule a
recovering country.

This will be a strong, united govern-
ment in dealing with foreign affairs. As
Eden said in a speech: "You cannot
give a mandate to a divided party."
I devoutly wished that the majority
might not be very large because I
want to see the Conservative Party
kept on its good, postwar behavior.
There are still plenty of Tories around
whose concept of the national in-
terest is something good for their
comfort, prejudices, and privileges.
Such people and their direct ances-
tors were responsible for that incom-
petence in industrial management,
that inhumanity in labor relations, and
that blindness in politics which all but
destroyed a first-class nation. A great
majority such as was given the Con-
servatives in 1924, 1931, and 1935
would have brought their kind to the
top in this election. As it is, the more
progressive leaders will hold the reins
of power. By "progressive" I do not
mean merely copying the socialist wel-
fare state, but a recognition that com-
petition, a free market, and individual
enterprise are best for all. In short,
what is called over here a "property-
owning democracy."

This Conservative government must
face the hard fact that the dismal
Conservatism before the war has not
been forgotten. Twelve and a half
million Labor votes and 277
members of the House
prove that. For as I made
clear in earlier dispatches,
Labor's greatest asset lay
in the bitter memories of
workers. The Conservative
Party had infinitely superior
organization, more money
to spend, and an excellent
record in office. It also had
the "breaks." Economic con-
ditions for which the government was
only partially responsible made peo-
ple contented. The Labor Party is
hopelessly split. President Eisenhower
lent a hand by agreeing to talks at the
summit at a critical moment.

There was very little anti-American
feeling displayed in this campaign.
Labor workers were cordial and help-
ful wherever I went, and I met and
talked with them all the way from
Bevan's Ebbw Vale to Attlee's Wal-
thamstow. Bevan called Tories "gig-
olos" under American masters, but
that was mostly campaign oratory.
Most significant is the fact that the
big losses in the Labor vote were in
constituencies which were safely on
one side or the other. The marginal
seats were bitterly contested, and
Labor did fairly well in them. This
means that Labor management, like a
general with inferior forces, concen-
trates them in the most critical spots.


**The Tory Margin**
The new House of Commons
compared with the old:

|             | New | Old |
|-------------|-----|-----|
| Conservatives | 344 | 319 |
| Labor       | 277 | 293 |
| Liberals     | 6   | 6   |
| Others      | 3   | 4   |
| Vacancies   | 0   | 3   |
| **TOTAL**    | 630 | 625 |

a solid victory based on apathy toward
Labor, not a landslide based on enthusi-
asm for the Conservatives. In the small
turnout (76.8 per cent, compared with
82.6 in 1951), the Tories' popular vote
actually was down 400,000. Thus Sir
Anthony Eden's victory is as much a
challenge as an achievement.

**Passport to History**
The job pays only $53.85 a week, the
hours are long and irregular, the work is
hard and exacting, and the physical sur-
roundings have been described variously
as part cathedral, part railway station,
and part prison. Yet, for all its drawbacks,
a cramped seat in the 615-year-old
House of Commons is to most Britons the
most coveted place in the world.

A total of 1,410 qualified men and
women applied for seats in last week's
election. Less than half of them-630,
to be exact-made it. And the backless
benches in the crowded, vaulted cham-
ber will accommodate only 437 members
at a time. The British like it that way.
"Imparts a sense of urgency," is the
official explanation.

Ordinary members of Parliament don't
even have a desk, much less an office.
Members can jot their notes and read
their papers in corners of Parliament's
500 rooms, eleven quadrangles, and
eighteen official residences-or at home.
There's even a rule book of what not
to say. Among the banned expressions:
Pecksniffian cant, insulting dog, jackass.

**Two Ton Snore:** Late night sessions
are common to Commons. Haggard mem-
bers have stuck through as many as 30
hours of debate at a running, cat-napping
as they could. A woman Conservative
once was shocked to find "Two Ton"
Bessie Braddock, Liverpool Laborite,
snoring on a couch in the ladies' room.

On the credit side, each M.P. gets a
train ticket to London, traffic priorities
from the bobbies, a coatroom hanger for
his sword, free snuff from the door-
keeper (among the regular takers: Sir
Winston Churchill), and, as one observer
has described it, a passport to history.
Few M.P.'s reach the heights of a

Newsweek, June 6, 1955

As the economic condition of work-
ers improves, they will have more
money to contribute to their party
while it reorganizes. There will also be
more workers to fight for what Labor
has lost in three successive elections.
This alone should warn the Conserva-
tives against complacency. It was
Conservative complacency and incom-
petence that originally made the Labor
Party a great force and destroyed
political liberalism. It is well that a
strong opposition is on guard to see
that history does not repeat itself.
