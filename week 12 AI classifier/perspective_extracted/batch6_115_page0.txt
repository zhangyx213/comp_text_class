**Speed, the Killer**

by Raymond Moley

THIS is the season when millions
take to the highways. Most will be
rewarded with refreshment of mind
and body and increased admiration
for the wonders and beauty of their
country. For some, the end will be
death or bitter suffering. For tens of
thousands more the tragedies they
witness and the narrow escapes they
encounter will haunt the memories of
their holiday.

Since February, in the
discussion of new highway
building plans in Washington,
we have heard many
reminders of the grim sacri-
fice of life and limb. The
President’s plan, created by
a committee headed by
General Clay, has apparently
foundered in Congress. The
attack upon
its unsound construction plans and
method of financing by Senator Byrd
was fatal. The Senate has passed instead
a bill sponsored by Senator
Gore which greatly increases Federal
money grants but which keeps within
the tested pattern of Federal-state
participation which has prevailed
in the past.

A vastly enlarged building program
is needed and it should be sufficient
to argue for it on the ground that
motor-vehicle traffic has doubled in
ten years and that millions of new
automobiles have been built and sold.
To expect this building alone to solve
the safety problem is futile. New
super highways and more powerful
cars will merely carry more fools to
dusty death.

Common sense as well as expert
opinion points to excessive speed as
more of a peril than defective, inadequate
highways.

Let us, without getting too statistical,
consider the evidence. Most important
is the common sense of every
driver which tells him that most perils
can be avoided by slower and more
careful driving. Add to that the established
fact that fatalities are much
more common in rural districts. There
is also the fact that states with long,
straight, and relatively uncongested
highways like Arizona, Nevada, Wyoming,
and New Mexico rank very high
in the number of deaths per 100 million
vehicle miles.

There is also the element of age. It
requires no statistics to prove that
youngsters like speed. Every father
or mother has heard the incessant
chirp: "Step on it." The figures show
that drivers between the ages of 18
and 24 are approximately 30 per cent
more likely to be involved in a fatal
accident than those between 25 and
44. They are more than three times as
dangerous as drivers over 45. Indeed,
flaming youth has plenty of
blood on its hands.

Finally, we know that
on the existing highways,
without a single structural
change, the death rate can
be cut in half by enforcing
reduced speed and careful
driving through stern police
methods.

It is true that much can
be done by education. But
my experience has shown that in restraining
fools, young and old, a good
stiff dose of punishment is worth hours
and hours of instruction. In what we
do by way of education let there be
plenty of demonstrations of the horrors
of highway abuse. The press can
help by printing pictures. What I have
seen of accidents in the course of
traveling hundreds of thousands of
miles by automobile has impressed
me more than could all the statistics
in the world.

**MORE** effective policing involves the
following:

1—More and more alert police. I
have traveled as far as 200 miles on
some of the man-killing highways of
the West without seeing a single
enforcement officer.

2—Stiff punishment. Fines are
mostly futile. Cancellation or suspension
of licenses or jail sentences are
more effective.

3—Compel offenders to lose time
by making them appear before
competent magistrates.

4—Cut speed limits everywhere.
Everybody knows that there will be
no arrest unless the excess is more
than five or ten miles. Governor
Lausche of Ohio read a good lesson to
his legislature this month in the course
of vetoing a bill to extend the limit
from 50 to 60 miles an hour.

Speed is the real killer and the
remedy is the law and the strict
enforcement thereof.
