**The Senate Spectrum**

by Raymond Moley

LAST week I referred to a study of
the voting records of members of
the 83rd Congress on more than 150
roll calls which, I believe, established
several sound propositions. These
were that the Republican members
of Congress were in substantial agreement
on the conservative side of the
ideological spectrum; that Democrats
were massed on the "liberal" or left
side; that the responsible leaders in
both houses were representative of
the general philosophy of their parties;
and that the President by his
own record and stated views is in accord
with the conservative views of
his party in Congress.

This week I shall describe this study
of voting in more detail as far as it
applies to the Senate.
This chart shows the ideological
grouping of the senators:

REPUBLICAN
DEMOCRAT

Left	Middle	Right
1 Rep.	14	32
1 Ind.	18	0
30


The senators included in the group
at the left, and running in order to the
right are: Murray, Kilgore, Lehman,
Humphrey, Kefauver, Hill, Hennings,
Neely, Fulbright, Magnuson, Morse,
Sparkman, Jackson, Monroney,
Mansfield, Kerr, Symington, Chavez,
Douglas, Gillette, Gore, Green, O.D.
Johnston, Eastland, Langer, Clements,
Hayden, Burke, George, Pastore,
Russell, Kennedy.

The senators in the group at the
right, and running in order from right
to left, are: Watkins, Bennett, Martin,
Goldwater, J.M. Butler, Hickenlooper,
Schoeppel, Barrett, Williams, Jenner,
Malone, Dworshak, Potter, Millikin,
Bricker, M.C. Smith, Upton, Ferguson,
Knowland, Bowring, Cordon, Beall,
Welker, Hendrickson, Payne, Carlson,
Dirksen, Purtell, Kuchel, Bush, H.A.
Smith, Capehart.

The "moderates" or "middle-of-the-
roaders," walking (not running) from
right to left, are: Bridges, Saltonstall,
Mundt, Aiken, Case, Thye, Flanders,
McCarthy, Duff, Holland, Ives,
H. Butler, Young, Byrd, Daniel,
Robertson, Frear, Smathers, E.C.
Johnson, Hoey, Ellender, Cooper,
Lennon, Long, Hunt, Stennis, Wiley,
Maybank, L.B. Johnson, Anderson,
McCarran, MeClellan.

I also have a study on a similar basis
of more than 150 roll calls in the 82nd
Congress. A combination of the more
than 300 votes in both Congresses
shows small consistent groups of conservatives and liberals. The former
were Bennett, Bricker, J.M.. Butler,
Capehart, Dworshak, Hickenlooper,
Mundt, Schoeppel, H.A. Smith.
The latter were Fulbright, Gillette,
Hennings, Hill, Humphrey, O.D.
Johnston, Kefauver, Kerr, Kilgore,
Langer, Lehman, Monroney, Morse,
Murray, Watkins, who ranked as the
first of the conservatives, cannot be
classed as consistent. For he was 25th
in the 82nd Congress. The only consistent "moderate" was Stennis.

While there are senators among the
"moderates" who have courage, capacity, and convictions, it must, I believe, be admitted that such men are
more numerous in both of the other
groups. Most strong men move to one
side or the other as their convictions
mature and their choices have been
made. It might be well if the President would reconsider such a statement as he once made in a press
conference that his Administration
was liberal in dealing with the relationships between the people and
their government and conservative in
dealing with economic affairs. He
would find it hard to build a party on
such a heterogeneous group as the
"moderates" listed above.

THERE is an eternal paradox in human beings which moves them to
believe that they are "moderate," but
which also inspires them to believe
that they have convictions. Those who
have the courage to stand by those
convictions stand out from the crowd.
They have loyal friends and bitter
enemies. They are not "moderate."
