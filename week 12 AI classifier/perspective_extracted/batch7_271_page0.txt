**Republican Revival**

*by RAYMOND MOLEY*

It is hard to believe it, but the Republican party is experiencing a sort of renaissance. Herbert Hoover is returning to a country which recognizes his world leadership in the most serious food crisis of our time. Secretary Byrnes boldly accepted Senator Vandenberg's formula for stabilizing Europe through an alliance. Captain Stassen is conducting a vigorous campaign of Republican education among young voters. And Messers. Dewey, Bricker and Warren—all prominent in 1944—are enjoying increased popularity in their states. There is bounce in the elephant's step these days.

It is too early to tell whether these spring plantings will yield a harvest of autumn votes, for it's a long, long way from May to November. It is also true that voters may buy their ideas at one store and deposit their votes at another. So let's not speculate, but observe.

Both the weakness and the generosity of President Truman are responsible for this Republican revival. The Administration's sterile policies and failures over the past year have created a vacant space into which Republican policies find it easy to enter. But President Truman is a patriotic and generous man. He is not afraid to give proper credit to others, nor is he afraid to cross party lines in the interest of his country. The authentic talents of Herbert Hoover were permitted to rust away for twelve years. It was singularly unfortunate to let four years of war pass without any attempt to use the services of a man who contributed so much in a former war. It is hard to think of a parallel case in any other country except Russia. But Mr. Truman had hardly settled himself in the White House before he invited Mr. Hoover down for a chat. And reports from both sides were that the President and ex-President conceived a real liking for each other.

Mr. Hoover is far beyond personal ambitions for office. He graciously abdicated his titular leadership to younger Republicans in his speech at the 1944 convention. But in a national and world crisis, when food is a major factor, he truly is an indispensable man. While no direct party advantage can be sought from such a mission as his, the result must increase the Hoover influence in national affairs. Moreover, real intellectual leadership was shown by Mr. Hoover in his Lincoln Day speech, which was a distinct appeal for Republican policies unlike those of the past twelve years.

Secretary Byrnes's Four-Power proposal, which stemmed from Senator Vandenberg, may or may not prevail in Europe. But if it does not, the United States will not be blamed for what follows. The idea was a bold departure from past American detachment from Europe. It was real bipartisan statesmanship. Usually political parties unite in war and divide in peace. This time, they were, to a degree, divided in war, but are united in peace.

Captain Stassen is making progress in bringing youth and ideas into his party. He and his associates in St. Paul are studying their lessons and developing issues involving labor relations, government finance, agriculture, and foreign affairs. Not since the initiation of the New Deal has such an effort been made rationally to work out national policies. And the means of putting these ideas into the heads of new voters will be through the Stassen Republican forums.

In New York and California, the two governors, Dewey and Warren, have gained strength in the past month or two. Early in the year, political observers were doubtful about the chances of either Warren or Dewey in their campaigns for reelection. But there is now a shift in opinion. Democratic leaders in New York are not so sure that Senator Mead, their probable candidate, can beat Governor Dewey. And in California, the Democrats, who will probably nominate Attorney General Robert W. Kenny, are not a coherent party.

In Ohio, John W. Bricker is running for the Senate, with an excellent chance of election.

A major factor in political trends now is potential economic disaster. The Hoover Administration was wrecked by a dislocation of purchasing power. The Truman Administration is facing a failure in production. One is as bad as the other. Each produces panic. No party in power can stand up against a panic in an election year.
