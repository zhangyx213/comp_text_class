**Perspective**

**Peace and Good Will to Come**

by RAYMOND MOLEY

And suddenly there was with the angel
a multitude of the heavenly host, praising
God, and saying,
Glory to God in the highest, and on
earth peace, good will toward men.

Christmas 1944 will not see peace
on earth. It is just as certain that
Christmas 1944 will see a grievous
shortage of good will toward men.
In America, disappointment prevails,
for even the more realistic judges of
military events had told us that peace
with victory in Europe would probably
come before this year's end. And
since a mood of disappointment always
underscores the facts with heavy black
lines, we see unnecessarily enlarged the
grimmer shape of things to come. Because
victory in Europe seems more
remote, we lengthen our estimates of
victory in the Pacific. We are preparing
ourselves for heavier burdens
and greater losses. Optimism is in
eclipse.

Even as we look beyond victory to
the eventual coming of peace, our
former high hopes are clouded. Those
who foresaw a restoration of legitimate
governments in liberated countries
in Europe through the return of
old forms and old rulers see great obstacles
to such an end. Others who
anticipated new and different people's
governments are not so sure. Civil
conflict is breaking out in many
places, and even the shadow of disagreement
among the great Allies is
growing. As the Long Toms roar on
every battle front, short and ugly
words crack on every home front.

As soon as the political campaign
ended in the United States, political
strife began in Britain. The Labor
party conference has heard bitter
words about Churchill and his colleagues.
Peace in Europe will most
certainly open a full-dress election
campaign there in which will appear
vastly controversial issues in foreign
policy.

In the United States, the Administration
has been disturbed by at least
two interdepartmental rows. The leftists
are dissatisfied with some of the
new State Department appointees,
while the rightists don't like others.
The new Congress will not be peace-loving.

I have not listed these disturbing
elements in current affairs here and abroad
to suggest that they bear a
casual relation one to the other. Some
of them are actually symptoms of returning
peace. Political controversy in
Britain, for example, could not be
tolerated when the nation was in deadly
peril. Political quarrels in liberated
countries have always taken place.
Washington always has its feuds, some
niggling, others fundamental. We fight
for freedom, and freedom does not
mean an end of ill will or selfishness or
of injustice. It means the opportunity
to seek justice by the free exchange
of views. We fight for law and order,
which is not to end quarreling, but
to provide orderly means of quarreling,
but
to provide orderly means of quarreling,
but
peace among nations is not that they
should agree, but that they will use
some means of differing other than
the killing of innocents.

The danger in the cumulation of
these symptoms of disorder is that
in the people's disappointment and
weariness they will interpret them as
signs that the promises we made to
ourselves and to the men who fight
are vain; that the world cannot be
changed; that once again cruel disillusionment
lies beyond victory. Another
danger is that we shall now
deceive ourselves with unpleasant
phrases, just as earlier we deceived
ourselves with pleasant phrases. We
now cry out against "balances of power"
and "spheres of influence," as we
see old nations follow familiar patterns
of control. Two or three years ago, we
joyously hailed such phrases as "self-
determination" and the "rights of small
nations." In both cases, we lay too
much emphasis on the phrase and too
little on the fact.

This perplexity on the home front,
which not only the citizen but his
government seems to share, brings to
mind once more the mistakes, the
delusions and the failures of the generation
that is now passing into old
age. It reveals how much depends on
the millions of young men who are
fighting now and who will return to
take over what we have failed to do.
Our Christmas message to them is all
that matters. It is a message of confidence
that they will win now and
succeed after victory. Strong arms
now and clear heads then. That is
the hope of the world.
