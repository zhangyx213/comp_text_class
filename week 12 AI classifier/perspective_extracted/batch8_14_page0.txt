**An Old Issue Comes to Life**
by RAYMOND MOLEY

COLUMBUS—Every seasoned observer at the Governors’ Conference held here in Columbus agreed on one thing. It was not just another governors’ conference, although this was the thirty-fifth annual affair of its kind. A familiar American issue flared up when the first visitors arrived on Sunday and burned fiercely until the last one left on Thursday. It was the issue of states’ rights, the oldest and, at the moment, the most vital of American issues.

A few years ago it seemed dead as the blue laws. It was something for retired lawyers to ponder as they turned from will-writing to metaphysics, and for dry professors to drone about to sleepy students. Yet states’ rights are the bone and sinew of our system. Before there was a nation there were states. Our States are not administrative districts; they are sovereign in many things. The issue is bigger than parties. What the 38 governors, almost equally divided between the parties, said here, proved it.

Federal control was reached some time back—perhaps midway between 1933 and 1939. Since then, the states have suffered acutely from the loss of power and revenue.

Clearly the party system, which is supposed to resolve all issues, has been inadequate to meet this issue. So it takes precedence over the party affiliations of the states and the governors thereof. The chairman of the conference was a Democrat, O’Conor of Maryland. The host was a Republican, Bricker. Dewey, a Republican, was challenged in friendly argument by fellow Republicans hailing from beyond the Mississippi. Governor Warren, a Republican who ran as a nonpartisan, was a good spokesman of the Democratic Mountain and Pacific States.

Apparently Washington knew what was coming. The only big Federal guns to appear were courageous military men like General Marshall and General Hershey. For the rest, every single one of the high Federal czars of oil, prices, food and manpower scheduled to speak here sent a deputy to brave the storm. Two of the civilian subordinates were probably sent because they were former governors, but, to be frank, they did not particularly impress the conference. The meeting was a rootin’, tootin’ affirmation that the states propose to have a real hand in running this country, now and in future. The Kellys and O’Conors and the Joneses said it. So did the Sewalls and Saltonstalls and Baldwins. And the Hickenloopers, Schoeppels and Schrickers.

One political result of this conference may be strong pronouncements on states’ rights by both political parties in 1944, regardless of the candidates who are chosen. Another is apt to be a fight in the Democratic convention over the platform, even if it nominates a fourth-term candidate.

The practical situation described by the many governors who spoke needs little recital here. Their cattle, pigs and sheep need feed, and there isn’t enough. Manpower is scarce. Farm machinery is needed. Prices are out of hand. In some sections, like the West Coast, civilian defense is shaky to the point of potential peril.

Politics, in terms of possible candidates for 1944, was freely discussed in private, but it was not a major factor in the conference itself. Bricker, around whom much speculation centered, like a gentlemanly host refused to talk politics, even at the cost of creating the impression among zealous reporters that he had no opinions. But all over Columbus were inanimate reminders of the pivotal political character of Ohio. From the walls of the dignified State Office Building, where the sessions were held, there looked down six sons of Ohio elected president since Lincoln—half the presidents elected in that time. Before the State House are statues of Ohio’s contributions to the War Between the States—Grant, Sherman, Sheridan, Stanton and Chase. Wartime Ohio is always politically interesting.

Inevitably, the problems described by various governors underscored heavily the practical impossibility of having a centralized bureaucratic system run a country of this size. This is not merely a war problem. The limit of efficient

The governors finished the conference with a resolution proposed by Democratic Governor Maw of Utah. It was their “considered judgment” that further encroachments upon states’ rights would be resisted, they said. The powers relinquished for war purposes should be recovered after the war, and, significantly, the governors pledged themselves to maintain an active lobby to keep these purposes before Congress.
