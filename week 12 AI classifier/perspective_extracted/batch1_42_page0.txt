**PERSPECTIVE**

**PATTERN OF REVOLUTION**

BY RAYMOND MOLEY

The present crisis in the Negro movement might have been anticipated by anyone who knows something of the course of revolutionary movements in past years and in other lands. For a point is reached in revolution when constitutional gradualism is overwhelmed and old leaders are swept aside by violent firebrands. These new agitators do not create the forces of which they take charge. They capitalize on a potential that is already there.

The succession of ever more violent leaders in the French Revolution, from the calling of the States-General in 1789 to the Terror four years later, is an example. In Ireland, after the Union in 1800 Daniel O’Connell remained as the leader of the struggle for repeal and sought a solution by constitutional and parliamentary means. But in the 1840s younger and more violent leaders took over and saddened the old man’s last years.

Lenin and Trotsky did not create a revolution. It was there when they returned. They took charge and gave it a name and ideology.

**THE POWELL POSITION**

In the present instance, the preachments of white politicians seeking Negro and pro-Negro votes laid the groundwork by raising unattainable expectations. Then came leaders like Martin Luther King and Roy Wilkins. Although preaching nonviolence, they so forcefully reminded their followers of injustices that they excited emotional and nonrational reactions which they may not have anticipated. And so they found their movement out of control. At Jackson, Miss., in June, Floyd McKissick and Stokely Carmichael, largely by using the phrase “black power,” moved to the fore. The old leaders as well as white civil-rights exponents are trying to hold matters in check by reason, common sense and understanding. But they are dealing with an emotional crisis that tolerates none of these virtues.

Adam Clayton Powell may or may not know of the historical precedents. But as a shrewd and experienced politician he can comprehend the pattern of revolution from what he sees and hears. He says the twilight has come for the Kings and Wil-kinses. And he knows he had better get out in front of the transformed movement or he, too, will pass. And so he claims that he himself coined the beefy phrase “black power.”

He said in a press conference that “black power” serves as a rallying cry for “the tough, proud young Negroes who categorically refuse to compromise or negotiate any longer for their rights.” He rejected the idea that it means national supremacy, but he did say that black power will be the controlling force in the big cities “as they become blacker.”

**BLACK POWER A GIMMICK**

It would be quite inaccurate and irrelevant to claim that Communists have created the new turn in the movement. But in the late 1920s and the early 1930s American Communists and the Kremlin in many manifestoes and statements deliberately sought to create an expectation among Negroes of becoming a controlling force in the areas where they were most numerous. In those days American Communist leaders were struggling hard to attract party members from among the Negroes. And they used “self-determination of the Black Belt” as one of many gimmicks in their 1932 platform to attract them. Indeed, at one time they mentioned a separate black republic within the dream of a Communist U.S.A. But as Communism faded out in America it has had little to do with the new movement for Negro rights.

Now the expression “black power” is also a gimmick used by the new leaders to cement their following and increase their personal power. There are new definitions every day. And these mean everything and nothing. But in an irrational climate, definitions of methods and objectives are irrelevant.

It is impossible to predict what the outcome will be. Perhaps the new militancy will die out, consumed by its own fire. Or perhaps it will last a long time, with sporadic outbreaks while the slow process of alleviating housing deficiencies and unemployment is carried on. But anyone can anticipate the toll it will take in impairing the relations between the races and in frustrating the labors of reasonable Negroes.
