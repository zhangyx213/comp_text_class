PERSPECTIVE

LBJ, JFK & ROUTE 66

BY RAYMOND MOLEY

CLAREMONT, CALIF.—In the course
of an automobile trip from New
York which ended here, I noted a
headline in an Oklahoma City news-
paper: JOHNSONS JUST LIKE US—
PLAGUED BY GRASS TROUBLE. It seems
that fungus is growing in the White
House lawn.

In the days since leaving New
York I have seen many ways in which
the Johnsons are “just like us” other
than in lawn-fungus afflictions. When
one leaves the Eastern cities far be-
hind, with their government by dem-
onstration and their claims for
poverty money, when one can forget
the restless college students until fall
and find escape traveling on the
highways along with hundreds of
others seeking whatever they may,
the hold of LBJ on the liking and
confidence of the American people is
not hard to understand.

Mr. Johnson, in a moment or two
between foreign annoyances, may re-
call this from his school reader: “To
scatter plenty o’er a smiling land.”
The land is indeed smiling, and he
sure is scattering plenty. This era of
smiles is not bought-entirely.

It comes because the President is
so much like so many other Ameri-
cans: his habits of thought, his
accent, his gestures, his interests—
serious and frivolous—and his homey
origins. He can be understood by the
folks without any effort at all.

ON A BRIGHT CLOUD

The line in the Elegy which fol-
lows the one quoted above contains
the word “history.” That’s all in the
future, when history will be written
by people who are now in some of
the schools benefited by the Johnson
legislation. They will know much,
much more than we can know now.

But in the early summer of 1965,
along Route 66 and Route 40 and on
the turnpikes and the bypasses,
among the hundreds whom we see
and hear in the restaurants, the
motels and gas stations, the incredi-
ble popularity of the President is a
solid fact.

Those who called themselves mili-
tant conservatives a year ago are not
talking much this year. I have seen
two roadside billboards saying “Im-
peach Earl Warren,” but the print is
fading after the long winter since
the 1964 election. Almost everyone is
riding along on a bright cloud of well-
being. How substantial that cloud is
will be proved later on. But what
sustains it now is clear.

The newspapers along the way re-
flect this public mood. Only The St.
Louis Post-Dispatch is screaming at
the President about his policies in
Vietnam and the Dominican Repub-
lic. But that is the reflection of the
dated liberalism of that newspaper.
Liberalism withers in a smiling land.

It is my impression that these
Americans that I have seen along the
route are probably unaware of the
professors’ teach-ins and the student
demonstrations. And those who do
know about them violently disagree.
The President, they believe, knows
best, and they would support him in
whatever he does to protect the lives
of American servicemen and the in-
terests of the United States.

DEEP ROOTS

I failed to get this impression of
pervasive happiness when we trav-
eled along this route in 1961, 1962
and 1963. John F. Kennedy was ad-
mired by most, he attracted the in-
terest of all and was loved by some
of the same sort of people I met on
this trip. But he never fitted the
headline “Just Like Us.” The acci-
dent of his birth to riches and de-
tached luxury, his private-school and
Ivy League education, his identity
with the life of the intellect set him
apart, despite his efforts to break
through the barrier. As Woodrow
Wilson wrote of Jefferson, he was a
“patron” of the people, never one of
them. President Kennedy was always
spiritually remote from the Midwest
and West. On one of his last trips
to the West, when he was scheduled
to hail the conservation of natural
resources, his audiences failed to
warm up to what he said and he
turned to other topics.

There is little to choose between
the domestic policies of LBJ and JFK.
The former is for everything his pred-
ecessor promised, only more. But that
is not the reason for his popularity.

Possibly the rarefied air of this
high plateau of popularity will take
its toll. Euphoria may have dangerous
consequences. LBJ may defeat him-
self. But now he has deep roots.
