**PERSPECTIVE**

**COORDINATING THE GOP**

**BY RAYMOND MOLEY**

In March 1966 Melvin R. Laird, a
very constructive Republican leader
in the House, proposed that a national
party conference be assembled in the
autumn of 1967 to draw up a party
platform for the campaign of 1968.
This idea was born of the general be-
lief that the framing and adoption of a
party platform at the time of the
quadrennial party convention, how-
ever hallowed by custom, make little
practical sense.

The climate of a convention of a
party out of power, heated by the ri-
valry for the Presidential nomination,
is wholly unsuited to the deliberations
necessary for a statement of party
principles. The product is composed
in haste, is dictated by compromise
and laden with double talk. It is sel-
dom read after the convention and is
soon forgotten. The candidate is not
bound by the platform and selects
and propounds the issues himself.

**ANNUAL PARTY CONFERENCES**

At the meeting of the Republican
Coordinating Committee on Dec. 12,
1966, the Laird idea was not adopted.
It was decided that the members of
the Coordinating Committee, a small
and continuing body, could them-
selves better agree upon and publish
party principles.

Behind the decision to reject the
Laird suggestion was the belief that
a big party conference might, through
the speeches of its members and its
debates, expose internal party differ-
ences and thus impair the chances of
victory in 1968.

The Coordinating Committee, which
now takes over the preliminaries of
framing party issues for 1968, is com-
posed of twelve Congressional party
officers, eight governors, all for-
mer Presidential candidates-Landon,
Dewey, Eisenhower, Nixon and Gold-
water-a representative of state legis-
latures and six officers of the National
Committee. The National Chairman,
Ray C. Bliss, presides over the Coor-
dinating Committee. The committee
has met eight times since its formation
in June 1965. There are several task
forces composed of representative Re-
publicans which issue attractive bro-
chures on specific issues before Con-
gress and the nation. Staff members
from the Republican National Com-
mittee and the various Congression-
al committees serve the task forces.

In my book "The Republican Op-
portunity," issued in 1962, I suggested
that the GOP adopt the British plan
of annual conferences. These are held
at some spot away from London by
the Conservatives, Laborites and Lib-
erals. They continue for several days.
There are speeches by party leaders,
and statements are drawn up which
are later used as guides for the party
manifestoes before general elections.
The conferences are widely publi-
cized and, as is inevitable, some dif-
ferences are exposed. But those
differences are generally composed
and in the process party membership
and the public generally are edu-
cated. Since issues change with the
passing of time, party positions are
constantly revised. The advantage of
annual conferences, widely publi-
cized, is that the voters of the coun-
try are informed each year about the
issues before the country.

Only if the GOP Coordinating Com-
mittee reaches an immense audience
with the reports of its task forces will
it be effective in that process so es-
sential to intelligent decisions at the
polls. Presumably these task-force
statements will be useful in writing
the party platform in 1968. But ap-
parently no provision is made for writ-
ing the platform before next year's
convention. Perhaps the Coordinating
Committee will prepare a draft plat-
form for the 1968 Resolutions Com-
mittee sometime in 1967. But it could
hardly be binding upon the delegates,
who will not be selected until 1968.

**NOTE.** Thanks to a new arrange-
ment with the management of NEWS-
WEEK I shall hereafter contribute
my articles under the standing title
"Perspective" fortnightly instead of
weekly. This change, after 33 years
of my contributions in NEWSWEEK and
its predecessor, Today, will release
time for a different sort of perspective
in a book. That book will attempt to
recall my observations and reflections
concerning American political ideas
since the turn of the century.

My biweekly contributions here will
be concerned, as before, with the
notable political and economic issues
in the changing times ahead.
