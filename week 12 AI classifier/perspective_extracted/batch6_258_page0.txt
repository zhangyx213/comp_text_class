**The Man and the Candidate**

by Raymond Moley

DENVER, COLO.—Except through the
printed word, radio, television,
and the accounts of witnesses, I had
no knowledge of General Eisenhower
until this visit to Denver. This first per-
sonal contact quickly verified the ac-
counts of the warm, friendly, simple
spirit of the man. None of the tinsel of
rank and authority has attached itself
to him, despite his years in high
places. But such attributes
are not the real stuff of
which great Presidents are
made. It is mental slant and
capacity that are decisive.
The first thing we ought
to learn about a man to
whom we may wish to en-
trust power is what he thinks
about power. On this, the
general has very positive
convictions. Perhaps no Pres-
ident in our time has had so intimate
a view of the exercise of personal
power by men in high places as has
had the general. This profoundly im-
portant experience has impressed him
with the essential meaning of constitu-
tional government and the limitation
of power, as he puts it, on the func-
tional as well as the geographical
basis. That means the principle of a
limited Executive and also adherence
to the sovereign rights of the states.
In line with this suspicion of power
is Eisenhower's firm conviction that
government—any government—should
not attempt to do anything that can
possibly be left to private initiative.
As President, he could be counted
upon to challenge severely any new
expansions of government activity.
In the field of domestic policy
Eisenhower is a man who is well to the
right of most of his advisers and, in-
deed, most of his early supporters.
On the subject of official morality,
there is something grim and funda-
mental in Eisenhower. In the Army he
was not known as a martinet in dealing
with erring subordinates. But his hand
was firm and his judgments inflexible.
That attitude would characterize his
administration of government. In this
campaign he will present official in-
tegrity as a major issue.
So far, it would seem, I have drawn
the figure in the stern traditions of
conservatism. But, his detractors will
say, does he not realize how deeply
the cold war increases the need for a
strong and active government—a gov-
ernment that will, to a degree greater
than most of us wish, intrude in the
private affairs of its citizens? That is
exactly why Eisenhower can be
trusted in the years that lie immedi-
ately ahead. For no one can more
broadly appreciate the needs of na-
tional defense, of the perils of our in-
ternational situation. And no one less
fundamentally committed to
the principles of constitu-
tional government could be
counted upon to keep in
mind that, after these
alarms, we shall need to
push back the hand of gov-
ernment and restore the
liberties of the people.
It should be emphasized
again and again that the re-
gime now in power, whose
policies Governor Stevenson will cer-
tainly carry forward, is committed to
more and more socialism, war or no
war. The moment the war ended in
1945, President Truman brought forth
the most radical of his Fair Deal pro-
posals. The cold war has been an ef-
fective screen for further promotion of
statism. The choice, therefore, is inter-
national cooperation under the leader-
ship of a man who deeply believes in
personal freedom under a limited gov-
ernment or international cooperation
under a regime committed to the un-
limited expansion of government.

EISENHOWER is showing remarkable
skill in dealing with the day-by-
day problems of campaigning. He has
already avoided the mistakes that had
doomed Willkie by this date in 1940.
The confusion that prevailed around
headquarters then is wholly absent
here. Where Willkie bestowed all
faith in amateurs, Eisenhower has rec-
ognized the need for a measure of
professionalism in his management.
He was not well prepared for this
campaign. He returned to the United
States too late to build an effective
personal organization. He was unfamil-
iar with many of the emergent issues.
But he is taking the essential steps to
prepare for the ordeal of intensive
campaigning. Altogether, the Repub-
licans have the best candidate they
have had in many years—one to whom
Americans can entrust their precious
liberties without fear.
