**POLITICAL UNIONS' WOES**

**BY RAYMOND MOLEY**

It was the late Robert Humphreys in
1948 who first analyzed the part
played by the politically oriented
labor unions in the Republican defeat
of that year. He was the NATIONAL
AFFAIRS editor of NEWSWEEK. He
pointed out that while Dewey had a
respectable electoral vote of 189, more
than any losing candidate had received
for 32 years (and more than any losing
candidate was to receive until 1960), the
defeat of House Republicans was
catastrophic. Seventy-four Republicans
in the House were succeeded by
Democrats. Truman was the first
successful candidate in many years whose
popular vote ran behind the aggregate of
the House candidates of his party. John L.
Lewis, the Reuther brothers and Sidney
Hillman plunged their unions into partisan
politics in 1936. Other unions followed.
Not only did those unions become aggressively
political, but their ties were almost
exclusively with the Democratic Party.

Later this union activity was formalized
as the Committee on Political Education,
COPE. That organization was strictly
professional, for union leaders were trained
in the arts of persuasion. In every election
year certain Congressional districts were
selected for concentrated work. Registration
drives were mounted and house-to-house
activity was organized to indoctrinate voters
and to get them to the polls. Political
arguments were broadcast in print and over
the air. Propaganda was seasoned with
demagogic slogans. And a box score was
published, giving the records of Congressional
members on legislation favorable to labor.


**OLD APPEALS FAIL**

This provided a rich potential for the
Democratic Party: thousands of workers
and plenty of money. The Taft-Hartley
provision against using union treasuries in
Federal primaries and elections was
circumvented or openly flouted. After one
effort to prosecute the United Auto Workers,
the government has regarded that law as
unenforceable.

Since 1948, Democratic majorities in
Congress and state legislatures have largely
been created by COPE. In 1966 COPE
participated as usual. Al Barkan, its national
director, boasted "we have more action, more
men, more funds, more precinct workers
than ever before."

But the usual success did not follow. The
smears of 1964 revived in 1966 were not
effective. Of 333 COPE-backed Democratic
candidates for House seats, 152 were defeated.
Governor Brown in California, Senator
Douglas in Illinois and G. Mennen Williams
in Michigan, favorites of COPE, were
overwhelmed.

Frank Rising, a veteran student of political
labor whose judgment I have respected for
many years, worked in Michigan for Senator
Griffin. He reports that the COPE leaders, so
used to success, failed to realize that their
members had either drifted away or were tired
of the old slogans and arguments. The
formerly "discontented" workers are now
older, are better fixed financially and are
unwilling to fight for what they already have.
The younger union members supported
Griffin. "From now on there will be an
enormous drifting vote not committed to any
party or any faction. Included in that number
are millions of 'young marrieds' and first
voters."

**RISKY ALLIANCE**

To these, Williams was a bleak reminder of
the past, floundering in his campaign when
he sensed that his personality no longer
suggested the flower of youth. His outcries
that Griffin was against widows, orphans,
welfare and education were simply not
believed. Everywhere the old hobgoblins
that once frightened workers are frayed and
faded.

My own conclusion is that the union-Democratic
alliance was a blunder when it was made in
1936. I said so then. For when a leader ties
his union to a party and he becomes a party
politician, he wastes some of the energy that
should be devoted to the economic interests of
his members. He then must share the risks of
the party with which he is identified. A
governor or a President may fall from favor
for reasons that have nothing to do with union
interests. The unions are then trapped in an
alliance of their own making. They have
squandered away their independence and
power.
