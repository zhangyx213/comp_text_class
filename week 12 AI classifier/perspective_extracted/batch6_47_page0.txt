**The Death of a Party**
by Raymond Moley

GUILELESS, old-fashioned Democrats who believe that the candidate of their party represents the faith of their fathers and is capable of making that faith live once more in the White House should examine the reality behind the façade. Perhaps the name Stevenson stirs nostalgic memories of the days of Adlai's grandfather, of Grover Cleveland, Woodrow Wilson, and Alfred E. Smith.

But they need the sharp prod of truth to realize that, except in some parts of the South, their party is dead, its faith is forsworn, and its candidate is merely an empty urn, a vacant reminder of a vitality that has long since turned to dust and ashes.

The maunderings of Stevenson and the meanderings of Kefauver are the shadows of this campaign. The reality is the massive, disciplined, ruthless machine conceived and created by Walter Reuther and pleasantly designated as the AFL-CIO Committee on Political Education—COPE.

The proof of the identity of the political agencies of a few union bosses with the Democratic Party in the 37 states outside the South is abundantly shown in the communication sent to 15 million union members, in which they are ordered to vote for or against members of Congress. This is called “How Your Senators and Representatives Voted, 1947-1956.”

**ISSUES**

The people who compiled this culled, with deadly precision, only an average of two roll calls a year, numbering twenty for senators and nineteen for representatives. Only a third of these “issues” have to do directly with labor interests. Most are of general interest, which shows that COPE regards itself not as a mere labor agency but as a national political party. As far as the unions are concerned, these political bosses regard them as mere reservoirs of money and manpower to be used to further their political ambitions.

The descriptions of the “issues” should be an affront to the intelligence of the members to whom they are directed. For they reek with misstatements and prejudice. For example, the “tideland” vote in 1945 was “to override the Supreme Court and give offshore oil… to coastal states instead of using the revenue for schools or some other purpose of benefit to all U.S. citizens.” The fact is that the Supreme Court merely left the title to the “tidelands” in doubt after generations during which the states had legal possession. Nothing was “given” to anyone. Indeed, in the Court opinions in the case it was suggested that Congress should act.

If Walter Reuther had been pulling the strings directly, the Democrats in the 37 states outside the South could hardly have obeyed with more servility. For of all the 26 Democratic senators in those states, twelve had a perfect score and seven deviated only once. Of the 132 House members of those states, 77 had perfect scores, and 29 deviated only once. (A number of these single deviations were among New England members on the 1956 Democratic farm bill. Perhaps they were more loyal to labor than were its own leaders.)

**IDENTITY**

Thus there was 73 per cent identity between COPE and the Democratic Party in the Senate, and 80 per cent in the House. In the next Congress the parity between COPE and Democracy may be nearer 100 per cent. With COPE providing most of the money and manpower in Senatorial and Congressional races, the substance of power is with Reuther, et al., while the name Democratic is merely a convenient reminder of the past.

The Ohio situation is typical of industrial states. There are 23 Republican House members and six Democrats. All six have perfect COPE scores. It remains to be seen whether in the years ahead those American citizens who have joined unions to serve their legitimate economic interests are going to be willing to serve as pawns—paying pawns—in this movement. For they are being exploited merely to serve the personal political ambitions of Reuther and others.

Unless they come to realize this and put a stop to it, there will develop much more powerful political forces to oppose them among the vast majority of Americans who are not members of unions. For the United States is hardly ready to be governed by a minority.
