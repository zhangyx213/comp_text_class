**PERSPECTIVE**

**Teacher of Statesmen**

**by Raymond Moley**

WILLIAMSBURG, VA.â€”Any teacher worthy of his profession conceives as his purpose the transmission of information to his students, along with methods for its application, and to inspire them to use what they have learned. George Wythe of Williamsburg was such a teacher and he lived to know that in the blinding fame of his brilliant students his own name would be all but forgotten by the nation he did so much to build. He might be said to be the father of founding fathers and the grandfather of the principles we live by.

He was a modest, quiet man. He sat silent in the House of Burgesses while floods of impassioned oratory by Patrick Henry and others swept over that body. Most of what he wrote has been lost, and no biography exists except in a few pamphlets and in the diaries of others. One of the massive contributions of the restoration of Colonial Williamsburg has been to rescue him from oblivion.

**GEORGE WYTHE'S CAREER**

Wythe came to Williamsburg in 1740 at the age of 14 and entered William and Mary College. Later he studied law in a local office. Then he mingled public service with the practice of law and the teaching of his apprentices. He entered the House of Burgesses in 1754 and served there during the violent debates that preceded independence. He served in the Continental Congress and signed the Declaration of Independence. He served as a judge, and when the capital was removed to Richmond he sat there as a member of the High Court of Chancery. He was chosen as a representative of his state in the Constitutional Convention of 1787, but left the sessions because of the illness of his wife.

The young Jefferson came to Williamsburg in 1760 and attended William and Mary for two years. His studies there were marked by variety rather than concentration. But when he entered Wythe's law office, a five years' training in law and constitutional history began in earnest. As a member of the House of Burgesses he discovered the profoundly important relationship of what he learned from Wythe's books

and the long struggle in England against royal authority. Jefferson's public services need not be recounted here. What is more important is the influence he exerted on younger men who came to him for guidance. Madison came fresh from Princeton to the House of Burgesses. Monroe came to study law with Jefferson. And the Randolphs and others were Jefferson's disciples. The habits of study which Jefferson learned from Wythe he transmitted as a directive to those disciples.

Wythe's basic introduction was the immense treatises of Coke. Then there were the political classics, ancient and modern. For Wythe was the foremost Greek and Latin scholar in Virginia. Some notion of this disciplinary reading is conveyed to us in a directive written by Jefferson in 1814 for his grandson, George Wythe Randolph:

Before 8 in the morning, studies in the physical sciences and religion. From 8 to 12, law. In the afternoon there was history. From "dark to bedtime belles lettres, criticism, rhetoric and oratory." Students in what one university president has called "the academic playpens" of today might be reminded of that discipline which made men great.

**FIRST LAW PROFESSOR**

At William and Mary, Wythe became the first professor of law in America. John Marshall was there as a student. After Wythe ascended to the bench, Henry Clay was his clerk. The disciples of Wythe and Jefferson became architects of the Constitution while the latter was absent in France. But in addition to this, all the basic documents embodying principles of liberty and order which originated in Virginia carry the influence of Wythe's learning and his personal influence. Never has what we so lightly call academic learning been so happily wedded to practical politics as in those days. No doubt, the tragic neglect of these early disciplines explains why our education is so formless and our national policies so ill-directed today. It explains in part why Americans are not quite sure where they are and where they are going.
