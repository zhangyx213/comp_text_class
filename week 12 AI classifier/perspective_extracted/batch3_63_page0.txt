**A TVA in the Northwest?**

by Raymond Moley

FOR more than twenty years public-power politicians and other zealots have been pressing for a TVA in the Columbia Basin. With Secretary Ickes as their Grand Sachem in Washington during half of that time and his surviving disciples still in power in the Interior Department, the names and details of the proposal have varied. But the essence has remained the same. The quest has been for a Federally created agency with substantial independence from state or Congressional reach, with a monopolistic grip on power production and resource development, and the capacity for regimenting the social and economic life of the people.

Ten years ago a plan for a Columbia Valley Administration was well underway in Congress, but stubborn resistance, notably by state governors, frustrated it. Then the reasonable Eisenhower partnership plan was offered. The long fight over private or Federal development at Hells Canyon was a part of the agitation.

Meanwhile, the Federal government has poured more than $2 billion into power and reclamation projects in the region. The Bonneville Power Administration was created to provide a power pool in which public and private power production has participated in a pooling arrangement. And a form of coexistence has grown up among private or investor-owned companies, Federal production, localized public utility districts (PUD's), and municipal plants. They have cooperated to serve the industries and people of the states involved.

**OLD BATTLE RENEWED**

The big Federal dams—Grand Coulee, Bonneville, McNary, and others—are there to remain permanently, a fact which the investor-owned companies fully recognize, with the reservation that there be a fair apportionment of the power generated between public and private agencies. The PUD's, which are numerous in Washington but not in Oregon, seem generally satisfied.

Meanwhile, the Northwest has grown in population, industry, employment, and living standards well above the national average. But now the old banners have been taken from the racks, and the war cries have been revived. Sen. Richard Neuberger has a bill which, with some subtle camouflage, is the reincarnation of the CVA. Extended hearings have been held on it (S-1927). It would replace the Bonneville Power Administration with a Bonneville Power Corp. The directors would be appointed by the President and must be “persons who profess a belief in the feasibility and wisdom of this act.” This means public-power people. The curious limitation on the constitutional power of the President is a borrowing from the Norris TVA act. Like the TVA, it would issue its own bonds up to a certain large amount. It would also have the essence of a “basic account,” another public power objective for a long time.

**DESIGN FOR MONOPOLY**

With the proposed corporation in full control, the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation would be substantially shoved out of the picture. The corporation would further invade the water rights which have already been dangerously cut away by Supreme Court decisions, despite the ancient and passionately held prerogatives of the states in which the water is located.

In short, the Neuberger plan, if adopted, would establish a substantial monopoly in power production and distribution, vested in a corporation which would be well removed from Congressional and Presidential control. The states, as was well shown by the governor of Montana in the hearings, would be relegated to impotence in their most important responsibilities. The power would exist to put the private, investor-owned companies out of business, despite their great development of capacity to meet the business and individual needs of the region. Local governments would lose essential tax sources.

Such an extension of the TVA precedent is not a matter of concern to the Northwest alone. It affects every American taxpayer and industry. The most unfortunate result would be that it would frustrate the orderly plans of coexistence now prevailing among the private, local, and Federal interests in the region.
