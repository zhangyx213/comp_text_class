**The Net Gain**

**by Raymond Moley**

To be shamelessly trite, the Nixon mission to Russia involved a calculated risk. The road had been strewn with failures. The British press and officialdom, wedded to wily diplomacy, were dubious. American careerists lifted formal eyebrows. Mr. K wondered what the trip was about. And Nixon’s enemies, who had worn threadbare the “tricky Dick” smear, were cynical.

Nixon fully weighed the great risk to the interests of the United States and to his own career. But this career has seen many crises, which he has always faced with meticulous preparation and calculation.

In this instance his preparation and readiness were adequate. And the queue of penitential doubting Thomases is long.

Nixon realized that the Soviet leaders are no traditional rulers of state. They had seen long years of the roughhouse of Communist politics and exhortation. Their equipment then and after they assumed official authority had been dialectic, spellbinding, exaggeration, shouting, and hand-to-hand meetings with people in the mass. Thus, in foreign relations they practice what has been called “cowboy” diplomacy. Meeting that sort of opponent is frustrating to the traditional diplomat. Not so to the first-rate, seasoned American politician, who is used to such exchanges.

**NIXON’S ADVANTAGES**

Nixon knew that he had another advantage. The Soviet leader’s mind is fettered by his own dialectic and ideology. To survive, he must be a conformist to the party line. An American politician of Nixon’s stature is equipped with a clear mind and capacity for quick, pragmatic judgments.

The Soviet leaders started this new phase of the cold war, in which personal visits and product exhibits are weapons. But in selecting these weapons they grossly miscalculated the facts. Blinded by Marxian dogmas, they failed to realize that capitalism delivers useful and interesting goods.

Also, they could not comprehend that in a free society like ours a successful politician must be adept at meeting people of all sorts and conditions.

Most amazing is the fact that the Soviet leaders misjudged their own people. After 40 years of discipline and brainwashing, those people are still concerned with products rather than propaganda, with good dinners rather than dialectic, with furniture rather than formulas, with kitchens rather than Khrushchev, and with freedom rather than fetishes.

Above all, those people are still simple and still friendly, and not one in a thousand seems to be much concerned with or interested in ideology.

The Soviet leaders dropped their guard in forbidding Nixon air transport home across Siberia, and thus they opened the way to a smashing triumph in Poland. They failed to understand that every other Pole either has a relative or a friend in the United States or knows someone who has.

**PEOPLE TO PEOPLE**

The immense gain through the Nixon visit has been the shifting of the contest from the representatives of the two nations, to the peoples themselves. Unwittingly, the Soviet leaders have permitted their subjects to share the responsibility of decision. And now, despite the rigors of their police, they must heed public opinion. This new element can well be underlined in the reciprocal visits of the President and Mr. K. When the latter arrives, all Americans, despite their personal feelings, must remember that this is a contest in good manners in which we must not fail.

No end of speculation will ensue concerning the effect of this spectacular mission upon Nixon’s chances for the Presidency. Here there should be considered a trait in Nixon’s character which has been noted by some careful observers of the man, especially by Earl Mazo. In his book, Mazo mentions many times the fatalism of Nixon concerning his political prospects. This trait is a profoundly rational recognition of the role of time and chance. A consuming ambition to be President has blinded many an American. Preparation is more important than anticipation. In this connection on another occasion I have suggested Shakespeare’s lines: “If it be now, ‘tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come: the readiness is all.”
