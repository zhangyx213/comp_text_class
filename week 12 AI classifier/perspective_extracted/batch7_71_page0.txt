No Red Herring

by RAYMOND MOLEY

A HIGH niche in journalism is open for
someone who has the will, the
patience, and the shrewdness to pick
up the threads of Kansas City political
shenanigans where Maurice Milligan
left the story at the end of his book,
"Missouri Waltz," and follow the trail
toâ€”wherever it may lead. It is a story
of high politics and low living, of great
influence, badly placed loyalties, safe
blowing, murder, gambling,
hoodlumism, and sundry
rascalities. And in the na-
tional interest it should be
rooted out and told.

I suggest that it be done
by journalism because it is
becoming clear that the sor-
did tale will not be elicited
by official investigations.
There was hope for a while
that the recently created
Senate Committee to Investigate Or-
ganized Crime might put together the
pieces of the story. But it will be a
surprise now, considering the member-
ship of that committee, if anything
comes of it except the twice-told tale
of interstate gambling combines, rec-
ommendations that Federal laws
tighten up the loopholes in interstate
laws, and prosecutions for perjury of a
few tinhorn slot-machine peddlers.
Sen. Estes Kefauver initiated the
probe idea a long time ago. After a
Senate battle of unusual ferocity, in
which Republicans contended for
their right to select the two minority
members, the issue was decided by
the ever-faithful Vice President's vote
after a tie. It was thus decreed that
the Vice President should select the
members from the Judiciary and the
Interstate Commerce Committees.
Senator Kefauver in accordance with
custom received the chairmanship.
The other Democratic members are
Senators Hunt and O'Conor. The Re-
publican members are Senators Wiley,
ranking Republican on the Judiciary
Committee, and Tobey of the Inter-
state Commerce Committee.

THESE are far from inspiring minority
choices. Republicans wanted Sena-
tor Donnell, because he knows a lot
about Missouri, and Senator Ferguson,
because he is the best investigator in
the Senate. Custom should have been
followed by permitting the minority to
select the minority members.

The Democratic majority, by deny-
ing this, betrayed a sense of danger
that should hardly mark the mood of
serene and unassailable minds. If
there is nothing buried in Kansas City
that could hurt the supremely con-
fident Fair Deal, this refusal to admit
real diggers is not the way to show it.
The country is entitled to have a
number of matters explained. Kansas
City politics is a national dis-
grace. It may be that current
Pendergastism is less corrupt
than in the old days when
Tom was living, but it is sor-
did and vicious. The Presi-
dent pursued with vindictive
power Maurice Milligan,
who sent Truman's bene-
factor to jail.

President Truman decreed
the defeat of Congressman
Slaughter, and it was done in the pri-
mary. The Kansas City Star brought
out the fact that fraudulent votes were
used in this job. The ballots were
mysteriously blown up, and thus the
vital evidence disappeared.

Congressman Slaughter, driven to
private life, was then vindictively pur-
sued by a prosecution so thoroughly
phony that it revolted the judge, who
summarily dismissed it.

TRUMAN placed the Pendergast
stamp on a great national party by
naming a Kansas City Democrat,
William M. Boyle, national chairman.
Boyle at a birthday party for
Pendergast II bestowed a national
Democratic blessing on the lethargic
boss by making an official presentation
of a symbolic offering.

Notable in the corrupt organization
of Kansas City are plenty of evidences
of the President's continuing loyalty
to the organization.

These are not pleasant omens for
Federal law enforcement in a city
which is a link in interstate criminal
activities. For the repression of those
activities is a Federal problem for
which the President and his Attorney
General are responsible.

President Truman, in citing the
Sermon on the Mount as his guide, no
doubt meant that the meek are
blessed "for they shall inherit the
earth." The trouble is that when the
meek inherit the earth they lose all
their meekness.
