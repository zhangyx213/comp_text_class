New Taxes? Why and What?

by RAYMOND MOLEY

THE decision of the House Commit-
tee on Ways and Means to refuse
the President’s peremptory demand
for new taxes is wise. If, as the com-
mittee says, it intends to do a bit of
“exploration” before undertaking to
write a tax bill, it has the promise of
plenty of discoveries. For the Presi-
dent’s budget is so full of vagueness
and wry estimates, and the Treasury
is so apt at misleading the
public and the Congress,
that there is every reason
why there should be time
for considered action.

In the first place, it should
be determined whether the
President’s estimates of the
amount needed to balance
the budget are reasonable,
even if his spending plans
are accepted. Next, there
should be a drastic reduction of
the proposed expenditures. Third, the
kind of taxes necessary should be con-
sidered, and most of the Treasury’s
suggestions should be rejected.

Let us consider these points in order.

THE President says that for fiscal
1952 there will be expenditures of
$71,000,000,000 in round numbers
and, on the basis of present rates,
receipts of $55,000,000,000, leaving
a deficit of $16,000,000,000 to be
covered by new taxes. His estimate of
receipts is higher than last year by
about $10,000,000,000. This increase
is supposed to come from the new
excess-profits tax, the new excises, and
the increased income taxes levied in
1950, with some allowance for addi-
tional revenue due to higher corporate
and individual incomes. But it is very
doubtful if this estimated increase of
$10,000,000,000 is high enough.

In at least two years in the past,
the President’s anticipation of revenue
has been a gross underestimate in
January, only to be revised in the
latter part of the year. The reason for
this is that in a year when the national
income and the gross national product
are rising, the receipts from taxes
will rise considerably faster. We can
assume a very large increase in na-
tional income and gross product for
at least two years. Therefore, there
is excellent reason to expect from
present rates in fiscal 1952 receipts of
$60,000,000,000 or more.

There is also the item of social-
security taxes. The amount raised by
these taxes runs in times like these at
about $3,000,000,000 more than social
security expenditures. This is spent
for other purposes, and in lieu there-
for government bonds are deposited
in the fund. That is why there was
actually a cash surplus in fiscal 1950
and why there will be only a small
real deficit in fiscal 1951.

Then, on the spending
side the need for cuts in
non-military items cries to
high heaven. Senator Byrd’s
estimate of needed cuts
amounting to $9,100,000,000
is reasonable. If Congress
accepts the President’s dare
and uses the ax, as Byrd
suggests, there might be no
need at all for new taxes.

But more likely, a hatchet rather than
an ax will be applied. So let us say that
$4,000,000,000 or $5,000,000,000 of
unnecessary or deferable expenditures
will be cut away.

These factors would bring the
amount needed to be raised by new
taxes down to a figure of something
like $4,000,000,000 or $5,000,000,000.
To meet this, it would be exceed-
ingly unwise to levy higher individual
or corporation taxes, except perhaps
to lower the tax base. One real place
to get new money is from what the
President and Secretary Snyder gin-
gerly call "loopholes." One of these
"loopholes" is the present exemption
of cooperatives. Secretary Snyder sug-
gests that money held by these in-
stitutions as reserves might be levied
against. I can see no reason why their
real profits should not be taxed. There
are a hundred millions of revenue
there, if Congress can summon the
courage necessary to get them.

FINALLY, the gap could be closed by
a manufacturers’ excise tax similar
to the Canadian manufacturers’ sales
tax. A levy of this kind of 10 per cent
at the final point of manufacture would
come to a rise at the retail level of
5 to 6 per cent. That would spread
the burden and at that rate probably
yield more than $5,000,000,000 of
additional revenue.

A bit of exploration and a dash of
courage in Congress would solve this
financial problem.
