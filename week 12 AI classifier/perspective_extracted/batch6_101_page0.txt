**Why and How We Educate**

by Raymond Moley

IN THOSE carefree pastoral years before Woodrow Wilson gave us worries about world problems, and the Wrights taught us to fly, and in politics the pursuit of happiness became a quest for more bureaucracy, parents sent their children to school and teachers taught them. Generally those parents had confidence that their offspring would be taught to spell, calculate in numbers, write legibly, and under the rein of discipline acquire good manners and respect for the rights of others. Those who were willing to be taxed twice had the assurance that their children would also learn that the world was not a materialistic pigpen, but a place divinely created and governed. Horace Mann and William Holmes McGuffey, who insisted upon moral fundamentals, were dominant among teachers.

But over the past 40 years a revolution has swept over our schools. Children are no longer taught. They learn by empirical experience. Faith and love and conscience have new and fancy names and connotations. Human reason and material facts are supreme. "Social" responsibility—commonly called the instincts of the herd—replaces individual responsibility. The political state has become the earthly embodiment of "society."

The high exalted seat of this new learning became the Teachers College of Columbia University, which not only taught teachers but the teachers who taught teachers all over the land. To have spent a steaming summer at T.C. listening to seers like Kilpatrick has been to tens of thousands of teachers an experience like that of the Canterbury pilgrims before the bones of Thomas à Becket. It was supposed to cure all but purely bodily ills. And often it yielded transitory romantic rewards. The high priest and major prophet over all has been John Dewey, at the mention of whose name dissenters were supposed to gulp and be quiet.

American parents taught in another generation slowly became aware of what was going on in their schools, and many of them did not like it at all. They resented not only the materialistic implications of Deweyism but its exaltation of the state over the individual. In the course of the bitter conflict which arose, embattled parents ransacked the libraries as well as the remembered residue of what they learned in college to plead their case in this contest of ideas. Their task has not been easy for educational philosophy has ancient origins and its mastery involves voluminous reading.

The layman's problem has now been solved by a remarkable book, "A Layman's Guide to Educational Theory."* One of its authors, Charles W. Coulter, has spent his life in the field of education. The other, Richard S. Rimanoczy, sharpened his pencil making abstract subjects simple in the business of advertising. Sixteen years ago he joined the American Economic Foundation where he has effectively labored to make the dismal science of economics clear to the average reader.

In this book the vast range of educational philosophy, which in its essence deals with the nature of man, the sources of what he knows, and the objectives sought in his education, is first sketched in 33 pages. Comparisons among the philosophers from Protagoras to Dewey are facilitated by charts. Then this history—from the learned men of Egypt who taught Moses to the Ph.D.'s in T.C.—is elaborated in 120 pages more.

THERE is, however, a hopeful trend. Human affairs never follow a straight line. They trace their course in curves. The tide ebbs and flows. Before now, the moral content has been extracted from education, first by the Greek Sophists and much later by Rousseau in the eighteenth century. In both cases the human spirit turned against the barren nourishment dredged up by feeble reason from the drab stuff of empirical experience. And now, once again, despite the entrenched position of Deweyism in our schools and in the National Education Association, we are witnessing a revolt against revolt. The shrill cries of "progressive" educators whenever their hegemony is challenged are no sign of strength but of insecurity.
