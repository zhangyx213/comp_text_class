**PERSPECTIVE**

**What's Back of a Hero**

**by Raymond Moley**

ALMOST everyone who writes for or speaks to an audience has drawn the many obvious conclusions concerning John Glenn's adventure in space. We have been told of the mechanical perfection of his voyage, his training and personality, and his fine behavior in the equally trying task of accepting the adulation of a grateful and admiring nation.

Perhaps everything has been said. But even so, certain observations are worth repeating now that the nation has turned to more prosaic matters.

The subject of heroes, past and present, has been written about in many classical expressions. The most notable of these is Thomas Carlyle's "Heroes, Hero-Worship and the Heroic in History." But there the subjects were the immortals, worthy and unworthyâ€”divinities, prophets, poets, priests, men of letters, and kings. John Glenn belongs in another category.

In another book of Carlyle's, his "Essay on Burns," the philosopher offers a comment pertinent in this instance: "A dwarf behind his steam engine may remove mountains; but he must be a Titan that hurls them abroad with his arms."

It in no way diminishes the luster of Glenn's achievement to compare his flight with that of Charles Lindbergh 35 years earlier. Lindbergh was an authentic individualist. His fertile imagination conceived his flight. He largely designed his Spirit of St. Louis. Raised the money to pay for it. Planned the effort, and flew with little to guide him. He took all responsibility for an adventure which was regarded with doubts on all sides. He was indeed "alone" from his take-off to the end of his flight.

**GLENN'S HUMILITY**

That his objective was not merely to capture a bit of fleeting fame was shown later when he ran in the face of public opinion in opposing our participation in World War II.

But Lindbergh, as well as Glenn, was the beneficiary of what had been learned of flying from Leonardo da Vinci to the Wrights.

To an equal degree, Glenn was no seeker of acclaim. In all that he said after the flight he portrayed himself as merely the focal point of a vast co-operative effort. He played his heroic part with little concern for what might come to him. He must realize now that the ordeal of meeting the plaudits which greeted his success was even greater than the task itself. Those who climb mountains will tell you that the most perilous part of the adventure is not the ascent but the descent.

Glenn received the adulation of statesmen in Washington and the masses of people who had watched and prayed for him in his flight. He projected himself as the humble instrument of a mighty cause. Millions had labored to create the means for this triumph of science and vision. Thousands of agencies in government and in private business created the technical equipment.

**THE MORAL IMPACT**

It was his mission, however, to prove what an official of the space agency said two years ago: "A machine in space can only tell you what you ask it through remote contact. Only a man can tell you what you cannot equip the machine to learn." The triumph was that of man. His ingenuity created the machines. His indomitable curiosity and imagination raised the questions which had been unanswered over the centuries.

But the moral impact of Glenn's behavior and words after the event has been a service to the nation just as important as the scientific knowledge which he made possible. There was a heartfelt patriotism in much that he said, especially when he addressed Congress: "I get a real hard-to-define feeling down inside when the flag goes by."

That sort of simplicity, coming from so worthy a source, cuts down deep through the layers of cynicism which have so deplorably encased the American character in our time. Too long, alas, Americans have been almost ashamed of the copybook maxims which in earlier years sustained their forefathers in times of peril and trial as great as these. We need this renewal of faith even more than we need to reach the moon. For without that simple faith we shall go the way of so many civilizations before us. Glenn is one of us; and because he is one of us, he is all of us.
