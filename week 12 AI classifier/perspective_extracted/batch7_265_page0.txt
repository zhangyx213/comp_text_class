**After Independence—What?**

by RAYMOND MOLEY

The birth of the Philippine nation entitles Americans to be proud of the policies through which this end has been reached. We have kept our promise. And in the constructive steps since this promise was made, we have earned good will which extends far beyond the Philippines.

Wendell Willkie said in Chungking in 1942: “Most of the people of Asia are determined to work out their own destiny under governments selected by themselves. Even the name of the Atlantic Charter disturbs thoughtful men and women I have been talking to. Do all those people who signed it, these people ask, agree that it applies to the Pacific? We must answer this question with a clear and simple statement of where we stand.” Later, Mr. Willkie added that there should be “an end to the empire of nations over other nations.” There should be “the orderly but scheduled abolition of the colonial system.” And he specified Britain, France, Holland, Belgium and Portugal as the imperial powers which should be brought to such a policy. Otherwise, Mr. Willkie continued, the United States would lose that “reservoir” of good will which our Philippine policy, our adherence to the Atlantic Charter and our conduct in war had gained for us among the teeming peoples of the East.

We have taken a first step—a step which, however nobly conceived, has cost us little. The relation between the Philippines and the United States has been unlike that between India and England. The Philippines have never been an important factor in our economic life. Powerful American groups, such as the sugar-beet people, have clamored for Philippine independence for years. Moreover, the Philippines have been no military bastion, but a military liability. So, as we pause to salute ourselves on Independence Day, we may well address our thoughts to the responsibility that goes beyond.

American observers in Asia have been greatly troubled by the contrast between Asiatic hope in us and American unconcern about Asia. Mr. Willkie’s “reservoir,” they report, has been leaking badly for a year. Our official foreign policy has reflected increasing detachment. Our affirmative attitude toward Britain’s colonial policy ended three years ago, with William Phillips’s report on his mission to India. But since then, we have steadily withdrawn from the affairs of Southeastern Asia.

Meanwhile, the old forces of imperialism have been reasserting themselves everywhere in that region. We have, by our detachment, given tacit agreement to the proposition that the Atlantic Charter does not apply to Indo-China, Indonesia and India. Force, occasionally implemented with arms made in the U.S.A., has pressed upon these restless people.

After granting Philippine independence, we have two continuing responsibilities: to assist in the reorientation of Philippine economy and to take active part in reorganizing the whole quarter of the world of which the Philippines are a part.

National independence is a necessary but not a final step in stabilizing this distant part of the world. The UN recognizes in its Charter that regional arrangements are of the essence in the modern world. The fact of empire which has held things together for centuries is senile. And the UN is still an infant. Regional agreements among old and new national states must preserve the balance in the generation ahead. And such arrangements cannot be imposed in such a way as to preserve exploitation. They must grow through the action of the nations concerned, with the genuine and sympathetic help of the great nations, including the United States. If we are to behave as a world power, we cannot detach ourselves from such developments, however remote from our shores.

Time is running out in Southeast Asia. More aggressive and articulate colonial nationalists are looking not only to independence, but beyond that to regional agreements. The Philippines are close neighbors to Indonesia and Indo-China. Whatever concerns those neighbors concerns the Philippines and ourselves. With us power is assured, but prestige is not. Prestige is something you earn and earn again. Our remaining prestige with these subject peoples will augment our power to persuade their former masters to grant their independence. But we cannot afford to wait too long.
