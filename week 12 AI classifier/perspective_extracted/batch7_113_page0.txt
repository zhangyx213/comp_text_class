**The International Goethe**

by RAYMOND MOLEY

VISITORS at the Goethe Bicentennial
Convocation at Aspen, Colo., re-
port the tremendous impact of the idea
behind the gathering, as well as the
intellectual significance of the ad-
dresses. As one visitor writes, it is "a
search for spiritual values to meet
present-day problems through a dis-
cussion of one of the world's greatest
searchers for truth." Since Goethe em-
braced universality of inter-
ests, many facets of culture
are considered; and since
Goethe spurned national
boundaries in his quest for
truth, intellectual leaders
from many countries are
contributors.

There is significance in
the fact that this endeavor
is an American idea and that
the meeting is held in the
heart of the country, rather than in any
of our various hubs of learning. It is
America that needs particularly to find
spiritual guidance these days; and it is
all America, rather than a few leaders,
that needs it most. For our country is
facing a dependent and demanding
world, and what is given must be
taken from all of us.

We are giving plenty of wealth,
plenty of scientific and mechanical
knowledge. But if that is to be the
limit of our continuing contribution,
we shall in the end not only fail to re-
fresh and renew broken civilizations,
but among our own people we shall
meet resistance to endless giving. Ultimately a spiritual and intellectual
substitute must be found for mere
wealth as international cement. And
that seems to be the meaning of this
slogan of the convocation: "The difficulty of our time is a difficulty of the
human spirit."


**SINCE** a major concern of the world is
to find political wisdom, we may
profitably turn to Goethe for guidance
in that field, as well as in literature,
religion, and philosophy. Although he
touched political life in a very practical way, his lessons for us are largely
inferential. In the realm of philosophic speculation, he seems to have
found guidance in Spinoza, whose
philosophy of politics was more or less
systematic. Goethe drew most of his
generalizations from that source. Like
Spinoza, he believed in authority. But while Spinoza leaned toward the rule
of an aristocracy, rather than of a
monarch, Goethe seems to have preferred the latter. Perhaps this was
because he found in Weimar great
encouragement for cultural growth
under a benign ruler. Perhaps his
expressed views were somewhat influenced by tact toward his patron. And
no doubt his disillusionment after the
excesses of the French Revolution inclined him toward
a ruler. He greatly admired
Napoleon.

But, like Spinoza, Goethe
believed that there must be
specific privileges for individual
freedom of thought
and expression. The approach is unlike that of the
great English exponent of
freedom, John Milton. For
Milton regarded the subject from the
standpoint of the individual. Goethe
and Spinoza conceived limited individual freedom as essential to the
preservation of the state.

There will be efforts to find in
Goethe central guidance in our effort
to establish ideological barriers against
Communism. But beyond the point I
have suggested above, the issue had
best not be pressed. Because, as Professor Borgese said to the convocation:
"It is not in the political and social
that Goethe is paramount; it is rather
at the inmost center of the spiritual
wherefrom all unities of the real are
born that his success is supreme; his
experience is exemplary."


**GOETHE** was utterly at odds with the
nationalism that was growing up
around him as he was growing old. He
was irked at the pretensions of his
own countrymen. He said in 1817:
"The patriotic German is so crazy that
while insisting on his own self-sufficiency he straightway appropriates the
merits of all nations and maintains
that all nations derive from him."

The bitter jest in this is that malignant German nationalism later claimed
superiority because Germany had produced Goethe, whose true greatness
lay in repudiating nationalism. His
fame and influence have now outlived
that narrow nationalism. The world
should note that somber fact, since it
tried nationalism at fearful cost. It
might well now listen to Goethe.
