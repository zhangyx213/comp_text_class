**News: Power and Policy**

by Raymond Moley

SOME news writers become news
makers. Immense press space has
been given to the "eyeball-to-eye-
ball" article in The Saturday Eve-
ning Post by Stewart Alsop and
Charles Bartlett, to whom the Presi-
dent referred in his news conference
of Dec. 12 as "old friends." Less at-
tention was given to an equally sen-
sational article by Alsop in the
preceding issue of that magazine, an
article which disclosed the war strat-
egy created by Defense Secretary
McNamara, as well as an article in
Look by Fletcher Knebel which
could hardly have been written in so
short a time without official help.
These "inside" stories should be
considered along with the restrictions
announced by the Defense and State
departments upon officials talking
with newsmen. The pattern which
emerges was stated by Assistant Sec-
retary of Defense Arthur Sylvester.
He said that his department would
"use" news to further foreign policy
because "information is power."
The motives of the President and
his brother the Attorney General in
manipulating the press invite fruitful
speculation. The Alsop-Bartlett arti-
cle could not have been written
solely to contrive the resignation of
Ambassador Stevenson. A much
shorter and smaller "leak" could have
achieved that. Nor could it have
been meant to put the whole Cuban
crisis in a glowing historical record.
That could have been achieved by
an official white paper written by a
Presidential intimate.

**IN WALPOLE'S DAY**

The most obvious purpose of this
practice is to adorn the President's
image as a strong man and to assure
the public of the efficiency of our for-
eign and defense policies. For this,
news is power at home and abroad.
In essence this policy goes back as
far as the ministry of Sir Robert
Walpole from 1721 to 1742. The two
King Georges during that period
knew little English and less of British
affairs. The ministers were dominant.
Walpole provided information to se-
lected journalists, which they issued
in the primitive pamphleteering
press. This was done to test current
policies and contemplated plans. If


the public and parliamentary reaction
was bad, Walpole would repudiate
the journalists. If favorable, they
were used again and again. They
were his expendable items.
In his press conference President
Kennedy made it clear that certain
journalists were "friends," but he was
not responsible for what they wrote.
Consider the probable effects of
this policy-which limits the accessi-
bility of the many to news sources
and opens them to the few-on the
press, on the public interest, on the
Kennedy brothers' Administration,
and on the "happy few" journalists.

**THE EFFECTS**

The vast majority of the Washing-
ton working press which is not fa-
vored will be spurred to frantic
efforts to get news wherever and
however it can. As one member said,
the press will not "roll over and play
dead." News there must be, and
some of it will be inaccurate. The
Kennedys cannot control all the out-
lets. In a press war between the ins
and the outs, the press suffers.
And the public is misled, irritated,
and suspicious. It will not be well
served and it will know why.
Perhaps the stark fact that writers
and commentators can be kept from
being overcritical by remembrance of
favors past and by anticipation of
favors to come will be controlling for
a while. But the Kennedy political
ascendency will suffer from a grow-
ing criticism. FDR was more astute.
He ignored the ire of publishers but
he won their working employes in
Washington. He knew better than
JFK that a President can't beat both
publishers and their writers.
Finally, those who enjoy Adminis-
tration favors will suffer. If they de-
viate from support for a moment,
their key to secrets will encounter
changed locks. They will be out even
beyond the present outs. Also, since
they have enjoyed rich grazing they
will be taken for granted, and the
Administration will start to woo the
ou's. Moreover, they will encounter
a growing hostility among their fel-
low workers in a fiercely competitive
business. News is too big to be man-
aged even by a super-government.
Walpole learned that the hard way.
