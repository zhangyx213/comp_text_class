PERSPECTIVE

THE USES OF POWER

BY RAYMOND MOLEY

One of Shakespeare’s well-known
aphorisms, which raises more
questions than it answers, says that
while it is “excellent to have a giant’s
strength,” it is “tyrannous to use it
like a giant.” I venture to suggest
that a giant may not enjoy his giant-
hood. It engenders in his associations
with other creatures a mixture of
fear and envy and of unhappiness
even among those whom he is dis-
posed to help. Those who thought-
fully contemplate his large lineaments
are likely to conclude that in building
his physical proportions Mother Na-
ture may have neglected the growth
of his intelligence. And indeed an ex-
amination of the evidence shows that
this disparity is often found among
men, animals and fish. In the past it
has not been unknown in the society
of nations.

The vital question raised by
Shakespeare is how a giant should
use his strength. And that is the nub
of the issue today between President
Johnson and those who have violently
attacked his intervention in Santo Do-
mingo and South Vietnam. How
should we behave as a world power?
For the United States is a giant
among nations. No statesman willed it
to be, and no political regime created
its strength. There were great ad-
vantages in geographical location, in
natural resources and the process of
selection which brought over from
Europe so many of the most vigorous,
self-reliant, imaginative and creative
members of old and mostly tired pop-
ulations. These people, detached by
the ocean from the wars and rivalries
of their homelands, exploited the re-
sources they found. That is what
made the United States what it is.

TO HELP OTHERS

But we now find that many sorts of
raw materials are required that are
not available at home. Of 77 strategic
materials required for survival in our
technological civilization, 65 must be
imported by sea. To keep these es-
sential supplies coming, not only must
we have the money to pay for them,
but a powerful Navy must keep the
channels of access open to us and
other free nations.

With our own strength established,
we have a moral obligation to help
those peoples too weak to help them-
selves. This does not involve a protec-
torate or a revival of colonialism.
By direct treaty and otherwise, we
have pledged to protect the inde-
pendence of 60 peoples and nations
from aggression.

In fulfilling that responsibility we
have given many billions in economic
and military assistance. This aid, not
always dispensed without waste, has
meant in many instances the margin
necessary for survival.

POPULARITY NO TEST

The United Nations which could
not live without our financial and
moral support, provides for many na-
tions, new and old, an international
meeting place where their identities
can be established and their prob-
lems can be made known.

A great power, thus meeting its
responsibilities, can hardly expect
general affection or popularity. That
is seldom granted to those who are
strong, among individuals or among
nations.

But we have earned what we
should expect, which is respect.
A word commonly used for this is
“credibility.” Those whom we help
and those we oppose must learn that
we mean what we say and that we
will live up to our pledges.

In every Berlin crisis we made
clear that we were prepared to en-
force Western rights. We brought aid
to South Korea and later to Formosa.
Credibility was strengthened in the
Cuban missile crisis. The same assur-
ance was given to Latin America
when President Johnson brought
peace to Santo Domingo. And now
the test is in South Vietnam.

Voices of criticism are heard not
only from the nations we have helped
but in Congress, in the press and
among our own people. But the Presi-
dent can be assured that in every
country threatened by Communist ag-
gression there is profound relief,
often privately expressed, that the
United States is serious in its purpose
to resist Communist imperialism.

The President who, it is said, rather
wistfully longs for love, can be as-
sured that if he stands firm against
his critics at home and abroad, his
commitment in Vietnam will have a
favorable verdict when the history of
these times is written.
