**How to Behave Like a World Power**
by RAYMOND MOLEY

**1—The Imperative Need**

The use of atomic power in warfare together with the prospect of peace makes it imperative that Americans prepare their minds, their government and their manner of life for something new in our experience. Roll up the maps, close the books and file away the patterns of 1939. Most are irrelevant to our future. The atoms of our old cosmos have been shattered by the events of the past six years.

It is my purpose in this and several subsequent columns to explore the new circumstances which must condition our thinking, our policies and our actions. It would seem appropriate, first, to consider not so much the detailed content as the direction of our thinking. Science is dynamic, but opinions and thought premises are static. The normal, sane human mind is indissolubly bound to the past. We think in grooves made by those who have passed on before us. The person who breaks that servitude is either a seer or a lunatic.

I am not suggesting lunacy as a way out of our difficulties, but I am suggesting that temporarily, at least, we reorient ourselves more largely by what we see and know of present facts and future probabilities than by past experience.

Consider what we were, what the world was and what we knew in 1919, at the end of the last war. Consider the nations which made the peace of Versailles—Britain, France, Italy, Japan and the United States. Germany in 1919, as compared with the Germany of today, was a giant. Italy, Japan and France have since slipped from the rank of great powers. Britain is relatively much weaker. Russia, then torn by revolution and weakened by the breakdown of a former civilization, was in the world’s doghouse. Now Russia and the United States are the giants of the earth, with the British Empire still cohesive, but impaired. With this reality before Russia and the United States, they can no longer indulge in the comforts of detached nationalism.

The most common argument for internationalism is that science and invention have made the world smaller. The basis of that argument is true. The derivative assumption—that the United States must take a more active part in international affairs—is also true. But that is not enough to explain the new outlook we must have. The more important fact is that as this country and Russia have grown stronger, other nations have grown weaker. That means not only that we must participate in international affairs, but must assume a more dominant role. No such dominance by so few powers has been seen on this earth since the Roman Empire, and the world then was a very small one. In the face of that, the idea of detachment is indeed fantastic. Science, moreover, has made the problem of defense a collective, not a national, matter. The nations must protect themselves in future not from one another, but from the cosmic forces which men have evoked from nature. The atomic principle is the enemy of all nations unless all nations join in controlling it. Like Frankenstein, we have made a monster which endangers its creator.

The tests of efficiency necessary for American government in the pastoral days of our past will need drastic revision. Qualities of mind and standards of training needed in high office in the past will not qualify for the new world politics.

Economic shibboleths will lose their meaning in a world in which American financial and industrial power will be dominant. Even many of our concepts of social legislation and state socialism will be irrelevant. Most old reforms were based on tight economic nationalism. Education and all other forms of communicating thought and information must be reconstructed.

All these and many other factors in our national life can be revised if Americans can genuinely comprehend the changes lying before us. For our mastery of our new role will depend on the capacity of our intelligence to keep pace with what has happened to us and to the world.
