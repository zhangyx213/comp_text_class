**What the Pauley Case Should Teach Us**

**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

Edwin W. Pauley can face his
next prospective employer with what
are called in more humble domestic
circles "the best of references." Honor
and faith and a sure intent have been
established. Honor, by Mr. Truman's
letter; faith in the Democratic party,
by Mr. Pauley's letter; and a sure in-
tent to continue traditional political
practices, by the original nomination
itself. It is this last aspect
which should concern us,
while we freely admit that
nothing in the hearings established
wrongdoing by
Mr. Pauley.

The real issue was not
that Mr. Pauley was an oil
man or a politician. The issue
was in his former service
as treasurer of the Democratic
National Committee.
That job is arduous. It must
also be thankless, for to assume its
toilsome duties should be to renounce
future official position. To spend one
year gathering funds for a political
campaign and another in an official
position which demands judgments in
which former contributors have interests is a sort of duality of function
which is contrary to the public interest. A Supreme Court judge does not
participate in a case in which he has
had a previous interest. And a generation of effort has been devoted to preventing a lawyer from practicing before government employees whom he
was formerly instrumental in appointing or over whom he once had official
authority.

The case against Mr. Pauley was
not simply that as a high official of the
Navy he would have had something
to do with oil. The question relates
to the whole traditional system of collecting campaign contributions from
expectant beneficiaries of favors from
government.

The problem, we must grant, is a
tough one. Political parties, like every
other agency dependent on voluntary
contributions, find passing the hat less
and less productive. Hence, we find
more and more pressure on prospects,
more and more covert inducements,
less and less disposition by party officers to look into the motives of contributors. The Hatch Act is good, but
it fails to meet this particular problem.

The fact is that a national party can
operate on a relatively small sum, if
reasonable efficiency is maintained.


The Republican party has, at this time,
a budget of about $750,000 which,
according to Chairman Brownell, is
considerably less than that enjoyed by
the late Polish government-in-exile
for its work in this country alone.
Some foreign nations spend much
more on propaganda here than the
funds of both American political parties
combined. Several pressure groups
spend more than either national party.

One reasonable reform in
this situation would be a
straight contribution by the
Federal government of, say,
$1,000,000 a year to the
funds of each national committee. Smaller national
parties could be paid
amounts scaled to their past
voting strength. The total
outlay of taxpayers' money
would be small in proportion to the
benefits derived. The parties would be
required to make an accounting of
their expenditures. And with a sure
income, they could maintain an adequate organization through the years
between elections. It is clear, considering the waste in a Presidential
campaign, that a dollar spent each
year goes farther than four dollars in
an election year.

This proposal would not solve the
whole problem of money in politics.
It does not touch pressure-group money, privately organized propaganda,
illegal spending or subsidized newspapers. But it would put national party
finances on a sound basis and eliminate the present expensive and difficult
system of soliciting funds. Most important, it would greatly reduce the
practice of trading favors and jobs for
contributions.

Under such a plan, no private contributions should be made to the national committees. They should live
within their income. And as far as
activity in a Presidential campaign is
concerned, there should be no private
contributions to state committees. In
fact, it would be a fine idea to have
such a system of subsidies in each
state.

Such a plan, if adopted, would not
meet all the manifold problems of
money in politics. Political trading
would still exist. But it would restrict
the area of impropriety. And it would
add dignity and responsibility to the
national committees of the parties.
