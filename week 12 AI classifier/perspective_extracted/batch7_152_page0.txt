**Perspective**
**New Mexico and California**
**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

ALBUQUERQUE—Of all the states surveyed on this long trip, New Mexico offers the most political color and suspense. In the battle for the Senate, a seat which the Republicans urgently need is within reach.

It has been clear for a long time that Senator Hatch has wanted to retire and has had an eye on a Federal judgeship out here which has been held for 31 years by Colin Neblett. Judge Neblett, despite advanced years, has been loath to retire. He once said: “There are only two jobs in New Mexico—the archbishop’s and mine.” But according to Willa Cather, death comes to archbishops, and according to Neblett, retirement does sometimes come to Federal judges. So the judge is retiring, and Senator Hatch will probably succeed him.

Clinton Anderson, formerly Secretary of Agriculture, is the Democratic candidate for senator. The colorful and aggressive Gen. Pat Hurley is opposing him. The campaign is warming up, and with Pat in there, that means warmer and still warmer from here on. By Election Day, it may turn out to be one of the hottest affairs in our political records. The issues will range over a cosmic area, including foreign policy in Iran, India, and China and the private fortunes of Hurley and Anderson. Since both candidates have been active and successful men, there will be plenty of material for offense and defense.

Hurley’s career—from the time when as a boy of 15 he tried to get into the Spanish-American War to this effort to enter the Senate at an age when most men think of retiring—has been an extraordinary sequence of action and events. He invites controversy, and Anderson, who has won many contests in this state, will have his hands full.

NEW MEXICO has in recent years been what might be called a normally Democratic state. The New Deal, fortified by huge Federal outlays, has held the balance among the large populations of Mexican extraction. Before that, Bronson Cutting ruled the state as a nominal Republican. And before Cutting and under Harding and Coolidge, the state was conservative and Republican. This tendency of the balance of power to shift with the complexion of the Federal administration may be the key to the outcome this year.

Anderson will undoubtedly have strong support in the eastern part of the state, where there is a heavy concentration of former Texans. But the so-called “native” vote will decide the result in New Mexico. Hurley will make a strenuous appeal to those who voted for his opponent of two years ago, Sen. Dennis Chavez. The Republican candidate for governor, Manuel Lujen, will help the ticket. And native leaders like the redoubtable Joe Gallegos have already renounced the Democratic Party and have declared for the Republicans.

CALIFORNIA, where both Dewey and Truman appeared in the same week, has no serious political contests this year. Republicans are confident, perhaps to the point of overconfidence. Neither a governor nor a senator is up for election. And the present balance in House seats is unlikely to change.

But California, as well as all the West, is interested in the views of the candidates on electric power, conservation, labor, and the identity of the next Secretary of the Interior. Robert Sproul, president of the University of California, is frequently mentioned as a good man for the job if Dewey is elected.

All the candidates are eager to please. Water power and conservation are given generous comment. Dewey has made it clear that he will look to the West for a Secretary of the Interior, although he has, of course, indicated no specific choice.

The call for unity made by Dewey and Warren is making a hit. It seems that President Truman handed them this issue on a golden platter. It appeals to the West with special force. It suggests to employers and to the rank and file relief from labor trouble. It offers an alternative to the bitter attacks in Truman’s speeches. And it fits the independent, nonpartisan sentiments of Western states, where people believe they vote “for the man, not for the party.”
