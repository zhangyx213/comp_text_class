**Ike Can't Do It Alone**

by Raymond Moley

IN THE past two months I have talked with and to many business and professional men, in and out of politics, in Ohio, Michigan, Oregon, Washington, and California. My concern has been the neglected role of business executives, professional people, the heads and employees of small independent businesses, and others in the political life of the nation. If that role is neglected this year, we are liable to be ruled by a Congress and by many State Legislatures in which the AFL-CIO Committee on Political Education (COPE) and radical farmers' organizations will call the tune and all the rest of us will pay the piper.

It has been encouraging to find so many businessmen, mostly junior executives, awake to the need and anxious to do something about it. It has not been so encouraging to find a considerable number, including some at the very top, who feel that with President Eisenhower in the White House four more years all will be well. This let-Ike-do-it attitude is accompanied by the ridiculous and ignorant assumption that the election is in the bag.

**EVERYBODY'S BUSINESS**

To be sure, a good many of these major executives are past the age when they can get out in the precincts and hustle for votes. To them, however, I have been saying pointedly that the least they can do is to make it clear to the countless junior executives and supervisory people who work for them that they regard such activity in either party as an expression of civic responsibility.

The time has long since passed when this enormous body of training and experience in management, selling, and human relations can stand aloof from the supreme responsibility of helping to govern the nation. Politics is not only everybody's business, but politics is in everybody's business. Election statistics over the past twenty years show that the regular party organizations have just about reached their maximum capacity to get out the vote. The regulars must have help not only from many more new people in their organizations but from auxiliary citizens' groups. The "liberal" wing of the Democratic Party receives such help from COPE and the ADA. There is no such help for hard-pressed Republican candidates in the North and conservative Democrats in the Southâ€”candidates for Congress and the State Legislatures.

The national leaders of some of the great unions pour into the ranks of precinct workers not only the officers of their unions but shop stewards and members of grievance committees. There is no reason why management should deny itself a similar right.

I am not suggesting here a conflict of economic groups. Class government comes not from a multiplicity of groups active in politics, but from the withholding of some while others take over. That is exactly what happened in Michigan, where the Reuther CIO-PAC took over the Democratic Party and then used it to dominate the government of the state.

**MANPOWER PARAMOUNT**

True representative, two-party government depends upon the participation of many interests in politics. When many interests and points of view are actively in politics, the broader concerns in the community and in national life are stressed and common ground is created for all. Union members themselves do not want to be a detached group in the community, concerned only with union interests and obeying at the polls the orders of a few politician-bosses like the Reuthers. Politics for them, as for all of us, should concern the whole of human life.

I am not denying the necessity for money in campaigns, but it is a sober fact that a few hours a week of active work in the precincts helps as much as many, many dollars. Conspicuously large money expenditures not only provide ammunition for the opposition, but tend to discourage those who cannot afford to give much themselves. It must be made known, perhaps by the President himself, that energy embodied in manpower is a first consideration. Those who cannot work can and should give the green light to those who can. Without such help the Eisenhower ticket may go down in the rout of senators, congressmen, and state legislators.
