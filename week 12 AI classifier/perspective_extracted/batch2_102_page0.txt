**PERSPECTIVE**

**Primary Nonsense**

*by Raymond Moley*

ONCE more, as in many pre-
Presidential years in the past,
politically minded citizens along with
many writing pundits are breath-
lessly anticipating the New Hamp-
shire Presidential preference primary.
Some seem na√Øve enough to believe
that next March there will emerge
from the farms, the hamlets, the lum-
ber and textile interests there the
authentic voice of the Republic. De-
spite its distinguished history, New
Hampshire encloses only about one-
third of 1 per cent of American souls
and minds. Almost twelve years ago
Gov. Sherman Adams, plus the inter-
ests mentioned above, delivered the
first of the blows that eliminated
Robert A. Taft, the most authentic
statesman in the Republican Party.
The Presidential primary is one of
the political nostrums created in the
Progressive era. The slogan then was
that "the remedy for the ills of de-
mocracy is more democracy." Hence,
in many states there were adopted
the initiative and referendum, the re-
call, and nonpartisan elections and
primaries. In this effort to "give gov-
ernment back to the people" reform-
ers not only imposed upon "the
people" tasks suited only to a nation
of Solons, Aristotles, and Ciceros, but
in seeking to eliminate certain polit-
ical practices they destroyed respon-
sible party government over a large
part of the nation.

**IMPOSSIBLE CONDITIONS**

During that era of political non-
sense, several states adopted Presi-
dential preference primaries. Carried
away by his slogan "the New Free-
dom," Woodrow Wilson, a novice in
practical politics, predicted that pri-
maries would supplant national con-
ventions entirely. After the first world
war, second thoughts about the sys-
tem seemed to take hold, but Presi-
dential preference primaries remain
in a minority of states.

It is obvious that any candidate
who seeks to further his nomination
by entering even a few of these pri-
maries faces almost impossible con-
ditions. Even with air travel, the
physical effort and stamina for cam-
paigning in widely scattered common-
wealths in the short period permitted
before the convention can be found


only in young and extraordinarily
strong individuals. Organized effort
limits the contest to those who either
are possessed of large personal for-
tunes or receive help from expectant
pecuniary interests.

The laws governing Presidential
preference primaries vary widely
from state to state. In some, a candi-
date must formally enter his name.
In others his consent is unnecessary.
In some, the voters are not required
to cast their votes for a candidate of
the party in which they are regis-
tered. Hence, by concerted effort
the members of one party may cross
over and vote against the strongest
candidate of the opposition party.
And great differences prevail in the
extent to which delegates chosen are
required to support the candidate
selected in their states. In 1912
Woodrow Wilson won the nomination
only because William Jennings Bryan
decided to abandon Champ Clark,
the primary choice in Nebraska, even
before it appeared that Clark's cause
was hopeless.

**A FAD STANDS FAST**

Each of the 50 states has interests,
election laws, and special organiza-
tional conditions of its own. A candi-
date preferred in one state may be
wholly unacceptable in many others.
National conventions have grave de-
fects, but they do reflect something
of a party consensus. Preference pri-
maries cannot contribute anything to
party unity after the convention. Con-
sider the posture of the voters of a
state trying to support with enthu-
siasm a candidate whom they had
repudiated in their primary.

Fads like mah-jongg, the black bot-
tom, and raccoon coats may be aban-
doned when the people's common
sense prevails. But the political fads
of the Progressive age are embedded
in the law. Their required rituals
must be observed long after their
defects have been proved. The legal
institutions adopted in the heated at-
mosphere of the Progressive revolt
should remind us that despite our
national pretensions we are still nov-
ices in the art of government. We
need not more democracy but greater
respect for and perfection of repre-
sentative institutions.
