**Perspective**

**The Distance and the Direction**

**by Raymond Moley**

MANY Americans in discussing the
present state of British politics
argue that, because there is such
agreement on specific policies be-
tween Labor and the Conservatives,
there is really little to choose be-
tween them. Some add to this com-
ment the view that the Conservatives
have stolen socialist ideas and can
claim only that they will carry them
out with more efficiency.

These comments are true
neither of the present fun-
damental policies of the par-
ties nor of the historical
origins of social reform.

In the middle of the nine-
teenth century the present
Conservative Party was cre-
ated out of the disintegrat-
ing fragments of Toryism by
the supreme genius of one
man, Benjamin Disraeli. This is the
more remarkable when it is con-
sidered that this man came from nei-
ther of the great ruling interests of the
time—the mercantile class, which
owned the new machines, or the
landed aristocracy, which held a mo-
nopoly of titles and privileges. Disraeli
had to contend against a widespread
belief that he was a poseur, a par-
venu, and a thoroughly unreliable
politician. He also suffered from the
prevailing prejudices against the reli-
gion of his fathers.

In building his party policies, he
appealed over both of the interests I
have mentioned to a supreme national
interest, symbolized in the Crown and
the Empire and which at least should
have its representation in the whole
of Parliament. Behind the institutions
of the Crown and the Empire he
sought to array the massive strength
of awakening masses of workers, both
on the land and in the mills. This he
accomplished by sponsoring a series
of long-needed social reforms. He in-
vented what he called a “Tory de-
mocracy,” the prototype of what the
Conservative Party now calls a “prop-
erty-owning democracy.”

Disraeli’s plea for political reform
was set forth in the novel “Coningsby,”
and his portrayal of the need for so-
cial reform in “Sybil.” Both of these
pleas for political and social justice
were published years before Karl
Marx wrote “Das Kapital” and dec-
ades before the origin of modern


British socialism in the Fabian Society.
Once vested with power at the head
of a ruling party, Disraeli secured the
enactment of legislation designed to
protect the health and safety of the
working man, to protect the farmer
and farm labor, to clear out slums, to
curb land monopoly, to improve the
lot of seamen, to protect investors and
the savings of the poor, and to en-
large the suffrage. The So-
cialists have followed rather
than led Conservatism in
furthering social reform.

The brilliant Conserva-
tive Chancellor of the Ex-
chequer, R.A. Butler said
during the recent campaign:
“... This country can, if we
manage our national affairs
with wisdom and energy,
double the standard of liv-
ing for all in the course of the next 25
years. Or, to revert to a familiar anal-
ogy, we can double the size of the
national cake, and everybody will
share in the increase. Our opponents
have always been so zealous and care-
ful in trying to cut the cake in exactly
equal slices, usually smaller ones, that
they lose sight of this vastly more
important aim...

“It is our simple but sincere ideal
to establish a level of living below
which no man or woman can fall
through sickness or misfortune, and
we have gone a long way...”

The Labor Party speakers, it is
true, said very little of nationalization.
But its considered policy as it was
told to me by many party members
was more and more socialism.

I SPECIFICALLY asked a very intelli-
gent officer of the Labor Party if it
could not be said that, while the two
parties were advocating many of the
same policies, in the direction in
which they proposed to go there was
a basic and sharp difference. With
this he thoroughly agreed. For as he
explained it, and as men like Herbert
Morrison said over and over in
speeches, it was the intention of La-
bor to have government assume full
control of the resources of the nation.
In contrast, the faith of the Conserva-
tive is to leave that control in private
hands, subject to reasonable regula-
tion. There is a profoundly important
difference here.
