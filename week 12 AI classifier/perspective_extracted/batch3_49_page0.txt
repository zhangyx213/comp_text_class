**What Happened in 1948?**

by Raymond Moley

The story of the fantastic Presidential campaign of 1948 and the stunning results thereof could teach 1960 candidates and political workers a lot if their memories go back that far. Let us pick out some of the pieces, beginning with some raw figures.

The three Democratic candidates, President Harry Truman, Henry Wallace, and Strom Thurmond, received in round numbers 26.5 million votes. The Republican candidate, Gov. Thomas E. Dewey, had 22 million. In 1952 the one Democratic candidate received 27.3 million; the Republican candidate, 34 million. In 1956 the Democratic candidate received 26 million, the Republican, 35.5 million. Thus, the Democratic vote remained substantially the same, although Adlai Stevenson suffered a loss in 1956 below his count in 1952. But in 1952 his vote was the total of that of the three candidates of his party in 1948, plus an amount which can be accounted for by the Democratic share of the increase in the voting population.

Consider this in its relation to the way Messrs. Dewey and Warren and their respective brain trusters planned their appeal. Both, especially Warren, were convinced that to attack the record of the Democratic Party would prevent them from getting Democratic votes. They failed to make a strong attack upon the Democratic Party and they failed to get any considerable number of Democratic votes for their forbearance.

**ATTACK, RALLY, AND WIN**

President Truman, much smarter than his opponents, tore at the Republican Party like an angry dachshund attacking a groundhog. He wasn't interested in getting Republican votes, thus following the campaign pattern which had won four elections for his predecessor. The Roosevelt-Truman strategy was always to rally the Democratic vote by a strong partisan attack.

At this point I shall be interrupted by certain pundits who have been repeating tirelessly that Republican strategy should be geared to snaring "Democrats and independents." The foregoing figures should care for the "Democrats" in the formula. But were the sleeping millions who came to life in 1952 really independents? If so, why did they slumber through the soft-shoe routine of the Dewey-Warren team? Real independence means a neutral attitude toward party, and Dewey-Warren were certainly neutral. Dewey only belatedly and softly defended the Republican Party against the demagogic, factually false attacks of President Truman upon the 80th Congress.

In 1952, the Eisenhower campaign, at first masterminded by the Dewey team, started in the first weeks on a largo tempo, like Shostakovich's Sixth Symphony. But there appeared on his desk in Denver a memorandum from the National Committee, the key words of which were "attack, attack, attack." The general came to life and smote the "Truman mess" with lusty blows. This quickened the public pulse, and 12 million more voted Republican than in 1948.

**WHO THEY WERE**

Those millions can be fairly clearly identified on the basis of what local political workers and penetrating observers now know. They were not really "independent" at all. They had a definite choice between the principles of government presented by the Republicans and those which had dominated the Democratic administrations before that time. They were not afraid or ashamed to vote the Republican ticket, provided it stood for something. Among the millions were a host of Republicans who were cold to the Dewey-Warren appeal.

More important still, Republican workers, the "regulars," were given something to fight for in 1952. They were so inspired that the necessary large vote was harvested. This vote was for the Republican ticket and against "more of the same." It was not composed of Democrats. And it was not independent when there was something to vote for or against.

This lesson of 1948 is most thoroughly and interestingly presented in a new book, "Out of the Jaws of Victory," by Jules Abels. It should be required reading for all candidates in 1960 and all party workers. It shows clearly how to lose an election.
