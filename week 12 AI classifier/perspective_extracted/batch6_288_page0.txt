**Political Couéism**

by Raymond Moley

When politics, during the 1930s, latched onto the science of economics, some very strange things began to happen. Now, in retrospect, it is clear that neither politics nor economics has been improved by this liaison. Both have emerged in a corrupted and disheveled state.

It is interesting to note, however, that the use which the Roosevelt Administration made of economic jargon differed quite clearly from that adopted in the Truman era.

The political economy of the Roosevelt years between 1934 and 1940 was based on the theory that our economy was mature, that the big companies dominated industry, and that they needed no new capital from outside. Hence, the "poisonous" savings of the public should be channeled—i.e., taxed, into government works. New businesses must be financed by government, and government would finally own or control all of the private economy. They said also that the economic system could never employ all available workers. Therefore, they would have to be eliminated from the working force by pensions, shorter and shorter hours, and more school years.

The Truman era developed another economic theory, which has had its grandiose expression in the President's economic reports, the most recent of which appeared two weeks ago. It abandons the theory of a mature economy idea of the Roosevelt era and says we shall have an ever-expanding one. Without saying so, it moves toward deficit spending and other inflationary policies. But since it built upon the piping years of the war, it has merely had to keep inflation going. It spends far more than Roosevelt ever dreamed of spending. And it has through loans, benefits, and vast public works, exaggerated the process of buying votes from favored minorities in the population.

Meanwhile, it enchants us with a sense of great prosperity by glittering predictions of the future, accompanied by an incandescent shower of figures about the present.

The difference between the political economics of the 1930s and that of the Truman regime is that the former frightened people into more dependence on government, while the latter intoxicates them to such a degree that they are unaware of their dependence. Both end in statism, in wholesale expropriation by taxation, and in general planning by the government. And both, by the suppression of individual enterprise, fail to increase the sum total of national wealth.

To illustrate this, let us consider the question of savings. The Department of Commerce is constantly telling us that "day by day in every way" we are getting richer and richer. We have been told that during the war years we increased individual savings by $119,000,000,000. As pointed out by an able student of government finance, L. Robert Driver, we became collectively poorer during those years by $105,000,000,000 because the Federal debt increased by $224,000,000,000 in the same period. Driver points out that while the people who "saved" the $119,000,000,000 may feel richer, they are part of a collective entity known as the American people, which must sometime pay what it owes. The debt we do by two and two we must pay for one by one. This repayment must be in taxes, in which case those who produce must save less. Or if ultimately the government fails to pay its debt at all, the people who were deluded into thinking they had saved by buying bonds are stripped of their savings.

Savings year by year are being destroyed by inflation. The Secretary of Commerce gave us the "glad" tidings during the holidays that "we" had increased our personal incomes in 1951 to $251,000,000,000, while in 1950 they were $225,000,000,000. But with inflation, our 1951 income would buy only $228,000,000,000 in 1950 goods. Also, we were taxed more. Hence, compared with 1950, we were $9,000,000,000 poorer. Our 1951 income, in fact, bought less than our 1945 income.

The economics of those who tell us that we are getting richer is "of such stuff as dreams are made on."
