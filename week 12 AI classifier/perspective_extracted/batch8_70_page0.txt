**The Return of the Prodigal**

*by RAYMOND MOLEY*

Something's been going on in this country that's just too good to embalm in prose like this. It calls for a great poet to set words to the song that's being whanged out on old iron in a thousand corners of the land. It's the song of scrap: scrap moving out of barnyards, millstreams, cellars, barns; scrap going to town, jolting over the roads; scrap thrown clattering onto big piles in village streets, schoolyards, church lawns, vacant lots by pa and grandpa and little Tommy. It's a song of repentance, too, for it is made by a people who in twenty years threw away more than most nations produced: the symbol of a prodigal nation's return when there arose in the land "a mighty famine"—a famine of steel.

The steel was there all along, of course—thrown away, rusted, forgotten. We can remember when ma sold the old stove and bought a dress with the proceeds. But somehow for twenty years people were too busy to salvage the scrap. Mostly it was collected only casually and sold to peddlers. Early this year William S. Knudsen wrote to farm-equipment manufacturers asking for help in collecting scrap. It was then that a great campaign was born. The International Harvester Co. had about 10,000 dealers and a large publicity department. It wanted to keep its trained organization together even though there wasn't much to sell. It wanted to help win the war. So it put its sales and advertising men to work planning a drive as carefully as any old-fashioned hell-for-leather sales drive.

Farm scrap isn't easy to get. Only the farmer knows where it is and what can be spared. It doesn't bring much money. Something besides the money is needed to bring it out. That something in this case was patriotism. Farmers throughout the country last month were told "There's a Bomb in Your Barn-yard." Harvester-Deering dealers were instructed by printed stories and pictures. The news went out to the very grass roots. Every available community agency—schools, churches, clubs, Legion posts, fraternal organizations and newspapers—was enlisted by the dealers. They were the centers of collection, keeping track of each person's contribution of scrap; selling the whole collection to companies in the market who carried it away, usually by rail; dividing the proceeds among those who collected it. The Harvester company charged nothing for its service.

That campaign reached its peak in May. Towns vied with each other. The returns are not yet all in and tabulated, but it is already clear that astonishing records have been hung up. The town of Pampa, Texas (12,895 population), collected 5,000 tons of scrap; the farmers around St. Peters, Mo. (305 population), brought in 60 tons in a single day. A good guess is that a million tons have been collected in the campaign. Beginning with June, farmers will be too busy to continue the collection, but after the harvest the campaign will be resumed. There's plenty of collecting left to be done.

The Harvester people are by no means the only energizers of community effort of this kind. There have been excellent campaigns in a number of communities—one by a steel company, another by the local manufacturers' association, another by the city government and another by a church group eager for money for a new pipe organ—to mention only a few.

The way is now set for a nationwide, coordinated all-industry drive of this sort aimed at collecting not only steel scrap but rubber, grease and many other essentials. The WPB is keenly interested. Important conferences have been held to organize the over-all effort. The war, it is clear, can be won with the stuff that is above the ground. Time cannot be spared to dig and grow all that we shall need. Scrap will win. The American people can get it if they will.

What we have cast off let us take back. The prodigal has returned, and, as the Bible said, when the elder son returns from the field let him hear "music and dancing"—the clang of scrap moving through the great productive channels into the finished goods of victory. In the process we shall learn that economic freedom, despite its prodigal waste and its mistakes, can create the means of its own survival. That is salvaging something more precious still—belief in our own future.
