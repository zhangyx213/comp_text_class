**Perspective**

**Let's Not Hurry This Time**

by RAYMOND MOLEY

The most significant fact yet shown by the proceedings at San Francisco is the necessity of drawing a sharp distinction between those postwar international issues which need immediate action and those which need time and patience. This distinction was certainly not foreseen and planned for by many of the delegates who went gaily to the Golden Gate with nice formulas for settling everything at once. But the rise of inevitable issues, the super-realism of Russia and the sophisticated realism of the British home and dominion governments have now made fairly clear the great differences not so much between nations, but between the different kinds of issues which came up.

The embarrassing appearance of several matters in which national interests transcend international control has dampened the ardor of some overhopeful people. But the frank way in which these issues have been raised at San Francisco will leave a more secure situation a year or two hence than the riot of double-talk and self-deception which took place at Versailles.

It is clear that there will be an international setup with large initial authority and sufficient scope to grow with the years. It is clear too that the major nations will retain a large measure of the means for self-security and that many small nations will enjoy protective relations or alliances with big neighbors. It is also clear that the effective neutralization of Germany and Japan will have priority over everything else and that, so far as Germany is concerned, there will be no serious disagreement among the major Allies.

The most obvious matters for future study and negotiation are the relation of regional arrangements to the international organization and the permanent disposition of backward areas in the world. These two vital issues which bear upon future international conflicts should be worked out with reasonably detailed care. In the case of regional security arrangements, it was the realism of Russia that prevented hasty action. In the case of backward colonial areas, it was the cautious realism of Britain that prevailed. In both cases, there was an exceedingly grave danger that slick formulas of words would be adopted that would merely add to general self-deception and aggravate future efforts at settlement. These two issues simply cannot be finally determined now.

Russia made it very clear that it regards a restoration of its friendly association with the Slavic nations west of its borders as essential to its security. In this respect Russia suggests an analogy with the American group associated under the Monroe Doctrine and the agreement of Chapultepec. Russia's treaties with Britain, France, Czecho-Slovakia, its so-called armistices with Axis satellites and its proposed interest in Poland and Yugoslavia suggest the outline of a regional plan for Europe. Our Latin American neighbors are just as intent on the principle of regionalism here. There will be a similar situation in the Far East after the defeat of Japan.

The concept of trusteeship also needs further maturing. Neither Britain and its dominions nor the Senate of the United States is going to permit a hasty formula to govern these essentials of national security. The differences in strategic importance, in degrees of civilization and in previous ownership that exist among the pieces of land outside the former boundaries of the United Nations will require many forms of control and government. Working that out will take time.

There are, finally, the vast problems that the defeat of Japan will involve.

It would certainly be a strange anomaly to consider the status of an international policing agency in the Far East while, in the immediate suppression of a riot in that area, Russia remains neutral. When the peace has been enforced, the time will come for a consideration of how Dumbarton Oaks fits into that half of the globe. Meanwhile, let us agree on the principle and general form of an international organization and continue, through competent and realistic committees, the effort to deal with regionalism and trusteeships.
