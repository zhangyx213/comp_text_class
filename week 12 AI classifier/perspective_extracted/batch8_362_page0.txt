**TODAY IN AMERICA**

**BY RAYMOND MOLEY**

**THE SHORTEST WAY HOME?**

WHAT does the President want if, when and as he succeeds in jamming through his Supreme Court proposal? Better prices for the farmer, shorter hours and minimum wages for labor and, for the businessman, revision of the antitrust laws and government-sanctioned agreements within trades and industries. In other words, he still intends to attain the objectives outlawed in the NRA and AAA decisions.

Why has he decided to pack the Court rather than ask for an amendment? Because, he says, he is reluctant to "waste" the time needed for ratification. But how much faster will he attain his ends by this "time-saving" device? Not at all faster: perhaps even slower, for the following reasons:

1—The best judges of Congress' temper believe that he cannot get his bill through before Summer.
2—The Senate is going to be in no hurry to confirm his appointments. So many feelings will be hurt in the process of forcing the Court bill through that the two-thirds vote necessary for judicial confirmations is going to be hard to round up.
3—The advisers of the President who have been closest to him on this issue are opposed to the economic principles behind NRA and AAA. It is notable that the four men called in by the White House last week to formulate wages and hours legislation did not include men like Richberg and Wallace but were, for the most part, disciples of Mr. Justice Brandeis who refuse to accept the national responsibilities created by the rise of highly integrated systems of production and distribution. They don't want Federal control of industry or of agriculture. They oppose concentration of power either in business, labor or government.

When the President gets his Court he still has the job of conciliating the economic views of these advisers with the views of those who believe that our democratic government cannot "work" unless it has the power to regulate industry and agriculture on a national scale in the interest of a balanced, dynamic economic system. That job of conciliation has been sedulously avoided for four years. But it must be faced before the President can proceed to put his economic program into concrete form. Until that issue is settled, no coherent course of action can be determined. This means prolonged debate over the proper way to achieve his objectives.

4—If the economic views of the President's advisers on the Supreme Court proposal prevail, adequate regulation of industry and agriculture will be indefinitely postponed. There will be no durable economic reconstruction. This will become apparent in late 1938 or early 1939.
5—If the President takes the other course, if he translates into specific laws the belief that industry and agriculture present national problems which must be dealt with by the national government, even his "rejuvenated" Court may outlaw those measures. Remember that the old NRA was declared unconstitutional by all nine of the judges. Even if all of the six

new judges believed, as does Donald Richberg, that the Act was constitutional, the majority of nine might still hold that it constituted an invasion of the rights of the states. But the Court is hardly likely to pass on this legislation before 1939.

6—Thus, if the President embarks on either of the courses indicated above, he is likely to reach 1939 before he discovers that (A) he hasn't got what he wanted, after all, or that (B) he is once again faced with a Court decision invalidating his reforms. By that time the businessman, the worker and the farmer may come to the conclusion that the shortest way 'round is not always the shortest way home.


**NEUTRALITY**

IF WE are to preserve neutrality, four fundamental conditions seem to me to be necessary:

To avoid a war boom, especially one dependent upon purchases by one side in a foreign controversy;
To avoid a war depression, precipitated by an attempt to apply an embargo on all exports;
To keep skeptical about the pretensions of foreign nations to international "morality";
To minimize the frictions resulting from interference by belligerents with our trade and the movements of American citizens abroad.

Several devices helpful to the maintenance of one or two of these conditions are embodied in the new Pittman bill, which has been the target for a barrage of criticism in the past two weeks. In large part, the attacks upon the Pittman bill come from two sources. Those, like our State Department, who want the President to have complete discretionary power to take sides against an "aggressor," are against it. Those, like Senators Borah and Johnson, who believe that the affirmation of the legal right of neutrals is sufficient to keep us out of war and that all other measures are unneutral, warlike acts, are against it.

The bill is an attempt to achieve a workable compromise between these two positions: it is a modification of the "cash and carry" policy—mandatory as to "cash," discretionary as to "carry." But it is full of dangerous loopholes. It gives the President discretionary authority which might well be used to apply sanctions rather than to maintain neutrality. It will not suffice to prevent a war boom in this country.

But before discussing these defects in detail on this page, I should like to clear the air by throwing out the false assumptions that underlie most criticism of the bill. I believe the purpose of neutrality legislation is not to cooperate with any group of nations in restraining an "aggressor." It is not to help defend democracy in the British Commonwealth or France. It is not to penalize a nation or group of nations for having a preponderance of military or naval power. It is not to affirm a set of legal rights which, whatever their standing in international law, this nation proposes to go to war to defend as a matter of national honor or business profit. The purpose of neutrality legislation is to help keep the United States out of war.
