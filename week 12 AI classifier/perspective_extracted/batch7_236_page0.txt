Retirement With Honor
by RAYMOND MOLEY

It is a notable event when a man
can retire voluntarily, gracefully and
without speculation about reasons
other than those publicly given. But
James F. Byrnes is a notable man and
statesman. He has attained almost
every governmental distinction except
the Presidency, and he narrowly
missed that. Leadership in the House
and the Senate for 24 years; membership on the Supreme
Court; the direction of the
most important civilian war
agency and, finally, Secretary
of State—these appointments
came not because he
wielded political power in
the usual sense or because
he was a sycophant before
the throne. They came because
the people with
whom he worked relied on
his judgment and respected
him. The Senate is a vital testing
ground, and Byrnes has had its support for sixteen years.

Nearly 40 years ago, Byrnes, a frail-
looking court reporter in South Carolina, took to the political trails. Over
the red clay and through the pines he
traveled and finally, in 1930, he
knocked into political oblivion the
Bilbo of those days, Cole Blease. “Who
Was Who” describes Blease as “the
only South Carolinian who has been
mayor of his city, senator from his
county, speaker of the House, president of the State Senate, governor of
the State and U. S. Senator.” Blease
was also a famous demagogue. Jimmy
Byrnes has redeemed the state of Calhoun and Hayne by topping the Blease
record without resorting to the Blease
methods. Molotoff the Hammer found,
as did Blease, that there is power and
infinite purpose behind the amiability,
the resiliency and the determination of
the smallish man from Spartanburg.

Byrnes was not well known
nationally during the Presidential
campaign of 1932. But no one had
more to do with Roosevelt’s success.
He was intimately present in that
campaign for five months, and in the
years that followed no one did more
to bridge the gap between the
White House and the Congress. His
political judgment is uncanny. His
basic philosophy is liberal, urbane
and tolerant. His capacity to analyze,
simplify and articulate complex intellectual problems is most unusual. And
his patience is infinite.


**Column 3 (continuation of main article):**

It is these qualities, brought to the
most serious task of peacemaking in
two centuries, which have earned
Byrnes a place in American history
with the great Secretaries of the past.
That a man with the delicate physical
endowment of Byrnes could have
sustained the burden for eighteen
months is a miracle of good fortune
for which Americans should thank
Providence. In an analogous
case, at the Congress of
Vienna, Lord Castlereagh,
who was also called upon to
balance the powers of Russia and the West, ended his
task in insanity and suicide.
Byrnes missed the White
House by the narrowest of
margins. He believed, with
the best of reasons, that
Roosevelt had told him to
go ahead and seek the Vice
Presidential nomination and that there
were no other commitments. Several
party leaders believed that Byrnes was
not only the best candidate, but that
Roosevelt preferred him.

There is no doubt of the fact that,
up until a day or two before the nomination was made, Byrnes actually had
the votes. But at the last minute other
leaders persuaded a weary President
that Truman was preferable. And so
Byrnes had to bear in loyal silence
the bitterest disappointment of his
career. There were enough senators
who knew this to provide the probability, after the death of Roosevelt,
that if Byrnes wanted to be Secretary
of State, any other appointment would
not be confirmed. President Truman,
a just man, gladly made the appointment and gave Byrnes full freedom
of action.

Sam Rayburn’s retirement from
the speakership is also due to no
failure of his own. Like Byrnes, he is
a man of profound tolerance and deep
loyalty. It was a singular and deserved
tribute that his colleagues would not
permit him to return to the ranks.
The minority leadership was all they
could give, and they gave it heartily.
Even the Republicans must have felt
a dash of regret that victory made it
necessary to displace a speaker whose
fairness and honesty they recognized
and loved.

Byrnes and Rayburn held the respect of Washington long before the
New Deal came. They retain it after
the New Deal leaders are gone.
