**Perspective**

**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

**The Rains Came**

No one looks impressive in the
rain. When the heavens speak mortals must
cower in caves or under umbrellas. And so
the first humiliation of the American
Youth Congress on February 10 was born
of a celestial frown. Banners cannot wave
nor spirits soar—in the rain.

But to be spanked in the rain! That pro-
vokes Homeric laughter and something
more—renewed reflection on the Roosevelt
luck. Because while Roosevelt planned the
spanking, Nature threw in the downpour.

The President was, as always, quick to
take advantage of his opportunity. So he
gravely told the boys and girls to get them-
selves dry before their afternoon session.
He didn’t add anything specific about wet-
ness behind the ears, but he made the in-
spired suggestion that the assembled youth
keep their feet on the ground. When their
poor feet were soaking in the grass and in
the mud!

The speech delivered on the White House
lawn that day expressed Franklin Roose-
velt at his very best. Kindly, tolerant, he
told his hearers that he sympathized with
their enthusiasm but deplored their meth-
ods. He reminded them that real jobs do
not come from government handouts, that
unwarranted schemes weaken the founda-
tions of security and that Russia is a poor
thing for American young people to ad-
mire.

Hoping to use the Presidential prestige
to further its cause, the American Youth
Congress suddenly found the President
using the occasion to enhance the prestige
of his great office. The Youth Congress will
not soon recover from this spanking in the
rain.

**Memo for July 1940**

While we can still keep the record
unfogged, before the Presidential campaign
formally opens, let us write down in our
book that the volume of business slid off in
the early part of 1940.

Let us write down that government
economists said last autumn that business
would probably decline in the first quarter
of the year. Let us give them credit for a
shrewd forecast.

Let us make note of the facts that the
forecasts were made and that the decline
had started before President Roosevelt
proposed economies in government expen-
ditures and before Congress set out to
make them.

Then, next fall, if apologists for the New
Deal find it necessary to blame another
slippage in business upon a decline in
spending, we shall not ourselves be misled.
No decline has yet commenced in spending,
of course, but one may take place follow-
ing next July 1.

In his budget message to Congress Jan-
uary 4, the President laid the sharp reces-
sion of 1937 in part to ill-advised cuts in
government expenditures during the pre-
ceding period. Again last week, in a Hyde
Park press conference, he said the recession
of 1937 had been attributable to a sharp
and sudden reduction in government
spending.

Well, how sharp and how sudden was it?
In the year beginning July 1, 1936, govern-
ment outlays were $774,000,000 less than
they were the year beginning July 1, 1935,
and, in the following year, they were
$414,000,000 less than they were the year
before.

Compare these reductions with the
budgeted reduction of more than $600,-
000,000 to take place in the year beginning
next July 1. In thus repeatedly adverting
to what happened in 1936 and 1937, could
it be that Mr. Roosevelt is building up to a
letdown—forehandedly providing an ex-
cuse for a failure of business to do what he
expects of it in the latter part of 1940, the
campaign season?

Actually he could have made a better
case for what happened in 1937 if he had
blamed the financial measures the govern-
ment was taking in 1936 and 1937 to “con-
trol the boom,” or whatever we were en-
joying at that time. Brakes were set, first
one and then another. There was the mar-
gin brake, the gold brake and the reserve
brake. But their action was delayed—an
unfortunate characteristic of much govern-
ment planning. It was not until September
that the wheels of the giant national ma-
chine suddenly locked. What followed was
the swiftest of all our business declines.
And there were other reasons for the de-
cline of 1937-1938—among them the effects
of the surplus-profits tax and the synthetic
shortage of business capital thus created.

What is happening this winter is clear
enough now. It may be less clear when the
campaign gets under way, considering the
methods used to explain history two and
three years back. Among the reasons for
the winter slide-off were the realization
that European orders for war materials
were not so large as many people ex-
pected they would be; the wearing off of
the overbuying of inventories in early fall;
and the pessimism aroused by the feeling
that Washington would do nothing soon to
lift the dampers upon enterprise. And by
no means the least, possibly the major fac-
tor is uncertainty over the third-term is-
sue. Whatever the reasons, they were in no
wise connected with the economy trend in
Washington. They cannot, by some his-
torical fiction in the future, be blamed up-
on the apparently reluctant economies pro-
posed in the budget message of January or
the work of the House on the 1940-41 ap-
propriations.

We must not let the passage of time and
the increase in political pressures blur our
memories of what was taking place at the
turn of the year, lest the enthusiasts for
spending use it to discredit the cause of
government economy once again. That
they will do so is almost certain if business
does not return to its November levels by
the time the nominations are made next
summer, and if, at the same time, the
greater part of the budgeted economy of
$600,000,000 is voted.

Let us remember that there has been no
reduction in spending as yet, that none has
been voted, that none can take place, in
any event, until after next July 1, and
that, therefore, what happens to business
this spring will have no relation to the
austere attributes of economy.

**Agony of Mr. Farley**

Jim Farley has rightly been pictured
as a kind of Prometheus, chained to the
rock of party loyalty while third-termers
devour his innards. As everyone knows, the
old story has it that Prometheus might
have brought his unmerited torment to an
end at any time if he had been willing to
submit his will to Jupiter. But that he dis-
dained to do, and he has therefore become
the symbol of heroic endurance, of proud
repulse, through the ages.

There can be no doubt about the suffer-
ing of the Prometheus of Grassy Point. Or
about his loyalty to the Democratic party.
Or about his personal dislike for a third
term. But the Promethean analogy begins
to fade with Mr. Farley’s announcement
of his own candidacy. This announcement
does not release him from the bonds which
may yet hold him to the support of Roose-
velt if and when Roosevelt becomes a can-
didate himself. But Mr. Farley has at least
twisted in his chains so that the birds can
no longer add to his torture. He does not
have to avoid questions about what can-
didate he is for. He can say he is for him-
self. And a leader in the conventions is
strong in proportion to the number of dele-
gates that he has. Whether Mr. Farley will
use his strength to form an alliance to de-
feat a third term in the convention is a
major question. And it may be that this
indeterminate question will not be an-
swered until the convention meets at an
indeterminate date.

Meanwhile, Mr. Farley has earned an
indeterminate amount of relief from his
suffering.
