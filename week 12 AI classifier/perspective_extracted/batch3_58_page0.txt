**Mr. K, Farm Expert**

by Raymond Moley

IT MUST not be forgotten that Khrushchev rose to power as a sort of agricultural genius. Not even the mystical Henry Wallace has had such wonderful farm plans as the Jolly Slav. But unlike our Henry, Mr. K had direct methods of demonstrating his talents. Henry had statistics at his command and some authority. But he was always hampered by his na√Øve ideas, which he designated as "democratic." Mr. K permitted no such impediments. Furthermore, he created his own statistical successes.

He originated in a Ukrainian village and has posed as an agrarian expert, a man close to the people who toil on collective farms.

It was Mr. K who, a few years ago, opened vast tracts east of the Urals for "progressive agriculture." It was a foolhardy venture and there was plenty of headshaking among the hardhanded, practical people who knew well the hostile, arid wastes of Kazakhstan. But a plan's a plan in the Soviet, regardless of the Lord, nature, and experience. And so men, tractors, and then women were shipped into the semi-desert.

While Henry Wallace was a deeply religious man with mystical overtones and Mr. K certainly is not, apparently the rain falls upon the just and unjust alike, this time heavily in favor of the latter. The rain came, a mild temperature prevailed, and the stuff grew. Mr. K was photographed smiling over a large potato.

**SOVIET JUGGLING ACT**

Statistics don't lie, they say, but it depends upon what you are counting and when. Facts can be manipulated to suit a purpose. In Mr. K's rise after Stalin's death, he made a sensational announcement: "Soviet Russia has fewer cattle than there were in czarist Russia." Specialists pondered this astonishing assertion. They found that Mr. K had classified cows as pigs and, statistically, transformed horned cattle into mares. Thus at the beginning of his enterprise he could point with alarm. After three years, statistical pigs were reincarnated as cows and the "mares" resumed their bovine classification. The Khrushchev propaganda duly capitalized upon this miracle. Wallace had a host of statisticians and knew in his off hours various haruspices. If he had succeeded, as he is doing now with chickens, in cross breeding the two species, his farm plans might have been the wonder of the ages. That miracle belongs to the atheist, Mr. K.

Americans are familiar with the Soviet boast, "Whatever you do we can do better." An American Army officer in Tokyo whose thumb was double jointed illustrated to a Russian officer how he could bend his thumb back to his forearm. The Russian did it and was immediately consigned to the Tokyo hospital. Readers of "War and Peace" will remember the officer who consumed a bottle of vodka while standing on a window ledge.

**BEHAVIOR PATTERN**

This Russian trait will be apparent in Mr. K's travels here. When Frol Kozlov, First Deputy Premier, visited the Middle West, NEWSWEEK'S Harry Homewood was present and relates the indifference of Kozlov and his retinue of Soviet photographers and newsmen. There was no evidence of surprise or admiration until they reached a dairy farm in Grundy County, Illinois. Up to then the standard comment was that "we have it too" and "more and bigger." But when they entered the farmer's milkhouse their interest rose to fever heat. The arrangement was normal for such an establishment-a three-stand automatic milker which transported the milk from cows to a stainless-steel collecting tank and thence to a truck. All was housed quite antiseptically. Every pipe and joint in the contraption was photographed amid great jostling and talking.

After collecting this evidence of an American achievement, they resumed their "We-can-do-it-better." One of them asked the meaning of "CO-OP" on the truck. A representative of the State Department explained. One of the Soviet reporters threw up his hands in a gesture of self-confidence, "Ah, Communism!" he exclaimed.

Whatever Mr. K says ad lib is not the important matter for observation. But what he and his group instinctively reveal in wonder and admiration certainly is. That is what they will carry away for future reflection.
