**The Baltic States Again**
*by RAYMOND MOLEY*

As Russian armies roll on, they are not only liberating peoples, but bringing the problems of what to do with those peoples sharply before us. The Russian-Polish border question is only the beginning. Later, there will be Finland, the Baltic states, Bessarabia and others. The controversy over their destiny will rage in Europe and, unfortunately, also among the nationals and former nationals of those countries in the United States. Some idea of the nature of that controversy can be conveyed by selecting one state—Lithuania—for further consideration. It is not typical, for all the states involved are different. But the complication of its problems provides a sample of the difficulty of applying to concrete cases the generous term “self-determination.”

Six weeks ago I pointed in this space to the difficulty of applying the principle of independence to the three Baltic states. They are unlike Poland, which, within certain boundaries to be determined, can be, as Russia has proclaimed, a strong and well-defined nation. They are unlike Finland, whose geographic position has preserved its distinctive nationality. Lithuania and her two neighbors, Latvia and Estonia, have been the beaches over which great waves have swept from east and west—waves of conquest, trade and migration. Whatever distinction the Baltic tribes which once inhabited that strip of seacoast originally had has been lost.

Three points must be made in the case of Lithuania. They concern first, the circumstances under which prewar Lithuania was created; second, the ethnic nature of the people in that state; third, the vicissitudes of Lithuania since it achieved independence after Versailles.

The Cordon sanitaire idea did not originate at Versailles. The Germans, in the peace of Brest Litovsk in 1918, enforced it upon a prostrate Russia. Lithuania, which had been part of Russia, declared its “independence” on Feb. 16, 1918, while the proceedings at Brest Litovsk were going on. Similar declarations by ten other parts of Russia were made at about the same time. Winston Churchill, in “The Aftermath,” describes this movement for “independence”: “They were to owe their liberty, if not their independence, to Germany, and the Russian Empire was to be stripped, by one saber cut drawn across the map of Europe from Helsingfors to Batum and Baku, of all the conquests of Peter and Catherine the Great.”

The ethnic nature of Lithuania is a subject of dispute. The Lithuanian language is no guide, for no scientist now will admit that a language is proof of nationality. The common sense of the matter is that, despite the persistence of language, the original non-Slavic tribes have long since been absorbed by the millions of Slavs which surround them, have swept over and mingled with them for centuries. The fact that Lithuanian governments, since our recognition of them in 1922, have not practiced the ethnic principles they preached is shown by what has happened. For years, they kept up a bitter quarrel with Poland over Vilna, although Vilna is 30 per cent Polish, 40 per cent Jewish and 25 per cent Russian. Lithuanians’ claim to Vilna was the fact that it was the capital of Lithuania five centuries ago. As Hitler’s power grew, there was a distinct tendency to create totalitarian-ism in Lithuania. In 1926, Antanas Smetona staged a putsch and became President. In 1933, when Hitler came to power in Germany, the Nationalist party made Smetona Tantos Vadas, which means National Leader. He later dissolved all opposition parties. (Smetona was recently killed in a fire in Cleveland, Ohio.)

Now, as my correspondence shows, there are two groups in this country engaged in denouncing each other and those, like me, who have written anything not to their liking. Perhaps, after Lithuania has been tailored to include a large number of Lithuanian-speaking people, a plebiscite might be conducted to determine whether it should remain as a Socialist Soviet Republic or as an independent nation. Those Lithuanians in this country who favor inclusion in Russia believe that a popular vote would be pro-Russian. This, however, is not a matter that can be forced upon our ally now or hereafter. But if, by tactful suggestion, Russia could be brought to this solution, it would please American opinion and, once and for all, silence Lithuanian anti-Soviet propagandists here, which is something devoutly to be desired.
