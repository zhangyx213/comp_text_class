**Perspective**

**The Neglected House**

*by Raymond Moley*

AN ABLE and conscientious member
of the House of Representatives,
who faces a grueling campaign in
which he is opposed by the powerful
machine of the AFL-CIO Committee
on Political Education (COPE), re-
cently made these salty remarks:
"Whenever the businessmen in my
district or their trade associations are
interested in some legislation before
one of our committees, they come with
their lawyers and public-relations peo-
ple and expect us to stand up and fight
for them. Within the limits of my hon-
est convictions I do just that. It is my
duty as a representative.
"But when the going is getting
harder with each election, and the
COPE is fighting me with money and
manpower, most of those people never
give me a thought. During the long
stretches between elections, when I
am in Washington doing my official
duty, opposition would-be candidates
are on the prowl among my constitu-
ents. There is no organized effort back
there to defend me. It is no wonder
that more and more of my fellow
members in the House are voting as
the AFL-CIO dictate. At least that
outfit backs up its friends when they
need it."
The facts bear out that observation.
In this year's "score" on Congressional
voting by COPE, 50 per cent of the
Democrats are rated perfect. Twelve
per cent deviated only once. An in-
creasing number of Republicans have
followed the COPE line. Thus, with
deliberate purpose and ruthless ef-
ficiency the political arms of the unions
are making over Congress to suit their
political objectives.

**TWO AGAINST ONE**

It is worthy of note that the
Eisenhower-Nixon speeches and the
activities of the Republican National
Committee give much more attention
to Congressional candidates than do
Stevenson-Kefauver and the official
Democratic organization. The Demo-
crats have virtually turned the cam-
paign for Congressional seats over
to COPE. Thus the President, a
strong and popular candidate, is really
fighting two parties.

According to reliable information
which has come to me, the United
Automobile Workers, with 1.5 million
members and 3,000 local unions, can
count on ten staff members in each
local for political activity. These ten
must mobilize many thousands of
shop stewards for work in the
elections. Each one is reimbursed for
time off the job, at an average rate of
$25 a day, plus $20 for the use of his
automobile. The United Steelwork-
ers have 1,200 full-time staff mem-
bers who will mobilize 12,000 shop
stewards for election activity. Many
other unions will be similarly organ-
ized. An estimated 100,000 COPE
cars will be working Election Day.
There is nothing like this on the
side of most GOP and conservative
Southern Democratic candidates.
Two-thirds of the House districts
that shifted in 1954 from Republican
to Democratic were carried because
of the activity of the political arms of
the unions. Now it looks as if most of
those districts will be held and a con-
siderable number of others added to
the Democratic side.
The neglect of the House by voters
is one of the disgraceful aspects of
American political life. In 1952 there
were 61,552,000 votes for Presidential
candidates. In 1954 there were
42,580,000 for candidates for the
House of Representatives.

**THE BIG JOB**

But this neglected House has been
the taxpayer's friend. Year after year
it has not only cut the President's es-
timates but has voted less spending
than the Senate.
Unless powerful auxiliary help is
developed in the years immediately
ahead, all that will change. COPE will
see to that.
There is little time this year to see
about registering more voters. COPE
has been at work on its own. There
has been appalling neglect on the
other side. In Pennsylvania alone Re-
publican registration fell off 600,000.
But a big job of getting registered
voters to the polls remains to be done.
In 1952, despite a record vote, the
parties in Pennsylvania failed to get
761,253 registered voters to the polls.
In California the number was
856,451. In Illinois it was 822,463.
This means hard work at the precinct
level if the next Congress is to repre-
sent the collective interests of all.
