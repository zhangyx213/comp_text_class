**PERSPECTIVE**

**The Colorado Lifeline**

by Raymond Moley


WHENEVER I have crossed the Colorado River near Blythe, Calif., I have entertained reflections on what that slim and calm stream means to so many Americans and some Mexicans. It is neither the largest nor the longest of our rivers. Its origin is in the Colorado Rockies 1,200 miles from Blythe; 200 miles downstream, what is left of it enters the Gulf of California.

There has been a cold war of controversy among the seven states which, with the river's tributaries, are in the Colorado Basin. A first step was taken in making an allocation of its waters through the Colorado River Compact, for which Herbert Hoover labored with diligence and diplomatic skill. This compact, approved by Congress in 1929, created the Upper Basin and the Lower Basin. The point of division and the measuring of the water was at Lee Ferry, near the Utah-Arizona border. On the basis of an annual volume flow, the Upper Basin was allocated 7.5 million acre-feet, and the Lower Basin 8.5 million. By treaty, 1.5 million were guaranteed to Mexico.

My own study of the problems involved began in 1951, when Arizona sought and failed to secure Federal authorization for an immense project to take water from the river and transport it to the area around Phoenix and Tucson. Then Arizona brought suit in the Supreme Court to determine the allocation of Lower Basin water among California, Arizona, and Nevada. The Court a few years later appointed a special master, former Judge Simon H. Rifkind, to review the case and to make recommendations. The special master held hearings over a period of nearly three years and submitted a report in 1960. In January 1961 the argument was heard by the Court, which now has the case under consideration.


**SHORTAGE OF WATER**

A most important phase of the case is that the estimated volume calculated in the 1920s seems to have been excessive because of the inclusion of six very wet years in the record. It now appears that the total volume of Colorado Basin water is 2 million acre-feet below the earlier estimate. California, relying on the earlier estimate of the state's quota of water, has spent vast sums on conduits and other facilities for its distribution to an immense and thirsty population. Arizona also has considerable anticipations. In all the states in the Colorado Basin there are huge Federal investments in storage, power, and irrigation projects built or building.

But this fails to deter the agitation of certain states and their representatives in Congress for still more exactions of water which may not be there. There are even two proposed transmountain diversion plans which would take water from west of the Continental Divide to the east.


**MORE DIVERSIONS**

One of these has been before Congress for several years. It is called the Fryingpan-Arkansas project, which would be built in the Colorado Rockies and take water from the small streams at the source of the river and carry it across and through the mountains to the Arkansas. The estimated cost would be $170 million.

Another is a combination of two plans. One is to take water from the San Juan River, a Colorado tributary, to provide irrigation on the Navajo reservation in northwestern New Mexico; the other, to build the first portion of a San Juan-Chima diversion to the Rio Grande Valley. The cost of these is estimated at more than $200 million. These would develop new land to produce agricultural commodities. The San Juan-Chima project would also provide water for municipal purposes.

During the years in which I have studied these river problems I have come to the conviction that in the case of all the states in the entire Colorado Basin, water is too precious a value to be used for irrigation. This is especially true because of the immense growth of the populations all over the Southwest, and also because we already have a heavy burden of agricultural surpluses. The famous Semitic code of Hammurabi, 40 centuries ago in Babylonia, provided that there should be a priority in the use of waterâ€”first, for man and beasts; second, for household use; and third, for the land. Congress might learn something from this precedent.
