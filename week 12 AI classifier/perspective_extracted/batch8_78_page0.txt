**An Industry on the Alert**

by RAYMOND MOLEY

LOS ANGELES—Within six days I have been able to see aircraft plants in operation around Buffalo and Los Angeles—two of the great centers of our American aircraft industry. Such a survey provides the material for a pretty general overhauling of a nonexpert’s conception of this war and of our part in it. To me it offered the buoyant food of a vast optimism.

It is not for the layman to discuss the details of the work going on in these plants, if for no other reason than that he would promptly bump up against the censor. Yet to talk with the experienced managers and look over the plants of these companies is to learn a profoundly important lesson—the lesson that the Japanese bombs over Pearl Harbor destroyed a lot of things not mentioned in the report of Secretary Knox. They destroyed a number of classic principles of war, particularly concepts generated on the European Continent. That was no loss to us. On the contrary, it was and is an ominous threat to Hitler.

It is only fair to say that this is precisely what the President has been trying to convey to us by his insistence that this is a new kind of war. Plainly it is not enough to say it is a world war or a war on many fronts. The way to measure the degree of its difference from preceding wars is to set up this war’s requirements against the traditions of American manufacture and transportation and match them against similar comparisons in the past. It is also the way to measure our chances of winning this war. For America, without realizing it, has built an industrial system sufficiently diversified and elastic to meet the challenge. The aircraft industry demonstrates that.

Nobody planned it that way. Innumerable observers have commented on the uniformity of American life. They were deceived by the surface. Underneath there was infinite variety. The plane plants I have seen look alike on the surface. Never, in fact, was there such diversity except, perhaps, in the automobile industry of twenty-five years ago. This war came when an intense spirit of experimentation and competition was still present in aircraft design and construction. Everything was being thought about. Nearly everything was being tried. Whether or not it was out of dire necessity, our government in 1940 and 1941 built upon what the industry was geared to produce. It combined a limited diversity with an attempt to achieve specialization within each plant, until now we have fighter planes for various purposes and bombers for various purposes, while something fairly close to the all-over ideal of a single model for each plant is being approached.

Göring could not dream of such diversity. Nor could he have achieved it with what he had to work with. Yet as we see the multitudinous facets of this war we realize that it is indispensable. We learned from Hitler’s inability to win the battle over England in October 1940 that something more than numbers is necessary. We can produce and are producing that something—diversity and specialization. We have learned, since, that diversity and specialization might scatter into impotence. Our salvation is that we can have both diversity and quantity. This is a combination that cannot lose. This is what we are getting. This is what our aircraft industry, in a way that thrills the most seasoned of observers, is turning out.

The subcommittee of the Truman committee of the Senate has pointed to the reason why our hope for immediate miracles must be tempered. Its report reflected what all aircraft executives say. The aircraft industry is turning out a lot of planes. They are, in general, the best in the world. But the aircraft industry is so largely an assembly job that it must, in the words of the subcommittee, depend upon “anywhere from 1,000 to 4,000 suppliers of parts and subassemblies to keep [its] main assembly lines going.” Plane production is not being delayed by workers or management. “Slowdown” is an expression foreign to the West Coast. Plane production is being hampered by slow deliveries from suppliers of parts and by the lack of raw materials. Remarkable substitutions, mainly of steel and wood, are under way. But speed cannot be greater until the greater and more regular flow of basic materials and parts promised by Donald Nelson becomes a reality.

**Left Column (Newsweek Article)**

had received notice on March 26 that their dispatches would be subject to increasingly close scrutiny and that whatever seemed “calculated to create ill feeling between the United Nations or between them and and a neutral country” would be deleted.
No one knew why the British had clamped down—though some laid the action to recent speculative stories on a movement to unseat Churchill and make Sir Stafford Cripps the Prime Minister.
To get things clarified, a delegation of American correspondents waited upon Minister of Information Brendan Bracken March 30. The new regulations, they learned, “will not have any effect on responsible correspondents wishing to send abroad an informed picture of Britain at work.” Furthermore, Bracken told them, “nothing will be done to interfere with the truth being told.” But the correspondents departed still uneasy over the future.

**Changed Backers**

In years, The New York Post is Manhattan’s oldest newspaper*; in enterprise, it is one of the city’s pace-setters. And this week The Post came out with two more innovations: a woman publisher and a tabloid format.

The new boss is the wife of George Backer, who bought the newspaper from J. David Stern three years ago but now has resigned as president and publisher because of ill health. Hence at 39 the attractive Dorothy S. Backer, hazel-eyed and dark-haired, steps into his shoes. Granddaughter of the banker-philanthropist Jacob H. Schiff and former welfare worker, she becomes one of the few feminine chiefs of big-town dailies heretofore typified by Cissy Patterson of The Washington Times Herald.

Mrs. Backer once wished to write a woman’s column. She has put that idea on the shelf and will concentrate on running The Post along the lines of its present pro-New Deal, pro-labor policy. Her editor and assistant publisher is Ted. O. Thackery, former executive editor.

As for size, the evening newspaper became a tabloid Monday after an experimental 5-cent tabloid Saturday edition proved to outsell the regular 3-cent daily edition. The Post in such form is not altogether new. In 1933, the paper tried a brief step as a conservative tabloid, but soon returned to standard size. The new Post, Mrs. Backer promises, will not go rowdy: “We are keeping all the regular features and services and the policy will be the same as under my husband.” But readers have already noticed a tendency toward the star feature of the regular tabloids—pictures of shapely girls showing more skin than clothes.
