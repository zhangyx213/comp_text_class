**INDISPENSABLE DISSENT**

BY RAYMOND MOLEY

The egghead word for it has been
"consensus." Before the San Fran-
cisco convention it was used to urge
Republicans to take the middle way
and present a candidate whose views
were relatively indistinguishable from
the presently established regime in
Washington. The two parties, they
said, should be so alike that transition
from one to the other might be with-
out effort or pain.

After this course was rejected by
the convention, the theme changed.
A Republican consensus had failed;
it was necessary to national harmony
to "bury" the GOP candidates.

Lyndon Johnson took up the refrain
from the consensual Republicans. He
expressed the same aversion to dis-
sent, but used the word "content-
ment" or its equivalent. In his vision
of an era of good feeling, his encom-
passing arms embrace the Fords and
the Reuthers, Harvard and Texas, all
races, creeds, sections, and national-
ities. The vision of Isaiah comes to
mind, with the wolf, the lamb, the
leopard, the kid, the cow, and the
bear, the lion, and the ox all peace-
fully resting in the Federal corral,
with good old Lyndon passing out
the corn pone. This syrupy sentiment
evoked a great amen in the press,
the pulpit, the pundits, labor, and a
sizable sector of business.

The President has said that "unless
there is progress, there will be dis-
content." The truth written in history
is that without discontent there can
be no progress. The milk from con-
tented cows may nourish the body.
But the miasma created by a con-
tented people corrupts the spirit.

**NO ERA OF HARMONY**

We have heard before of "an era
of good feeling." That is what the
second term of Monroe was called
after that President had been re-
elected by a vote which lacked
unanimity by one. But in the early
1820s the two parties were shattered
by factionalism. Crazy speculation
west of the Appalachians brought to
the inhabitants inflation, bankruptcy,
and distress. The Missouri Compro-
mise deferred but did not solve the
slavery question. In the East the
Bank of the United States brought
corruption into the Senate itself.
Latin America exploded in revolution

and great imperial powers of Europe
moved in for the kill. It was the end
of an era and the beginning of the
revolution which centered in Andrew
Jackson, who was called worse names
than were applied to Goldwater.

But the national growth which
followed until 1860 found vital
nourishment in dissent. Nonconform-
ity was the very spirit of those who
came from the Old World to this
new land. My old professor at
Columbia reminded his class that
America was populated by "kickers."
The 1964 equivalent of that word is
"kooks." The belief that dissent can
be purged by a debacle at the polls
is fatuous sophistry. The questions
about the past 30 years of liberalism
raised in this campaign will not die
in November. They go to the very
essence of our national character,
purpose, and destiny.

**THE DIFFERENCES REMAIN**

The revolution which swept the
Republican Party in San Francisco
may not yet provide the essential
talent for government. But so long as
the vigor of dissent remains-and it
will remain-it will shape the political
patterns of the future.

Goldwater rejected wholly the
concept that Americans can be satis-
fied with only those material means
which can be bestowed by a paternal
government. He pointed to a differ-
ent sort of war on poverty-the need
for a war against that poverty of
spirit that manifests itself in compla-
cent acceptance of bribes in the form
of indiscriminate subsidies. The polit-
ical trickery of passing on the burden
of costs to another generation is be-
coming quite obvious to those who
must shoulder that burden.

The need for dissent, I feel confi-
dent, will soon appear even to those
who have been frightened by what
is called Goldwaterism. It is not
merely the man Goldwater that was
involved in this decision. It may well
be the principles and policies for
which the President asked a mandate.
So long as dissent is abroad in the
land, the health of the nation is as-
sured. For the shaping of the future
is not within the power or province of
any one man or one temporary regime.
The right of dissent is an attribute
of freedom.
