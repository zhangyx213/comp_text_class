**Perspective**
**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

**Men in Harness**

In Mr. James A. Farley's article in
the September issue of the American Magazine, there is a comment which has an
interesting bearing upon the tests of party
loyalty in the current Congressional primaries. It refers to an official of the Administration who, without rancor and with
continuing friendship and support of the
general principles of the New Deal, chose,
of his own free will, the profession of an
independent commentator on public affairs and resigned his office.

Mr. Farley's words reveal a delightfully
frank approach to political philosophy. According to him a man in public life must
not find it "hard to work in harness with
other people," and he must learn to "trim
his views." One must compliment Mr. Farley's blunt honesty in using the unvarnished words "harness" and "trim." The
comment might reasonably be interpreted
to mean that a party must put a "harness"
on its members and that a major virtue in
a public man is his ability to "trim." But
Mr. Farley would probably prefer to consider the virtue of "party loyalty" in contrast to the virtue of independence.

Aristotle, whose experience in politics
was not insignificant, inasmuch as he was
the tutor of Alexander the Great, suggests
that virtues cannot be compared per se,
but that a virtue to be desired in a man
must relate to his calling, profession or
status. Thus, the virtue of loyalty is paramount in a soldier and in an employe of a
business corporation or of the executive
branch of the Federal government, while
in a journalist, for example, independence
is of first importance, particularly when
he writes under his own name.

Now which of these virtues, loyalty
or independence, is appropriate in a member of Congress, differing, as he does, from
an executive appointee, on the one hand,
and a journalist on the other? Mr. Farley,
thinking of a Congressman primarily as a
party member, would probably stress loyalty to the party. Others, including many
members of Congress, would prefer independence, or at least loyalty to their constituents. But even if, for purposes of
argument, we reject independence as the
quality most becoming a member of Congress and accept the test of party loyalty,
let us see whether the thing Mr. Roosevelt
demands is in truth party loyalty.

Since Mr. Roosevelt has deliberately selected Senator George as his prize example
of political disloyalty, let us examine the
charge and the evidence. Mr. George, since
the first Roosevelt inaugural, has support-

ed 34 proposals sponsored by the President.
He has opposed ten, including only four
major reform measures—the Supreme
Court packing plan, the death-sentence
Holding Company Act, the Reorganization
Bill and the Wage-Hour Act. Two of these
were beaten by Democratic votes; two
were passed. He supported a whole galaxy
of measures sponsored by the President,
including financial, agricultural, industrial,
tax and social-security reforms.

The party platform of 1932 did not
even imply the death-sentence feature of
the Holding Company Act. The 1936 platform indicated a different road to its objective than Court Packing. These two
were born of pure executive caprice. Mr.
Roosevelt's reorganization plan pushed
aside that of a Democratic-controlled
committee of Congress. The Wage-Hour
Act was pure sectionalism opposed almost
solidly by Southern Democrats.

I venture that no party in any democratic country ever expelled a member for
this small degree of nonconformity. If a
party did so, it would destroy itself, because honest-minded men would tell such
a party to go to blazes. No party platform, nor conclave, nor committee has
condemned Mr. George. It comes down,
in Mr. Roosevelt's own words, to a matter of personal fealty. The test is whether
a man "in his heart" believes in the objectives. But who is to know what is in
Mr. George's heart if, as Mr. Roosevelt
suggests, the record is to be ignored? Presumably Mr. Roosevelt alone is to be the
psychoanalyst.

Mr. Roosevelt then shifts his ground. He
says he and Mr. George "do not speak the
same language" and charges, by inference,
that Mr. George gives only "lip service"
and has not raised his little finger to attain the objectives. To say this in the face
of the Senator's 34 votes for Roosevelt
measures is to invite in the mind of every
reasonable man amazement and incredulity. All of this must mean that a Senator must place in Mr. Roosevelt's hands,
figuratively of course, a blank draft for his
vote, to be registered when, where and for
whatever purpose executive judgment or
caprice may suggest.

But a man cannot be loyal to caprice,
and so this does not bring us back to the
question of party loyalty, but rather to the
words Mr. Farley uses in referring to his
former colleague—"work in harness." For
the purpose of a harness is to concentrate
control in the hands of one person—the
driver. This is not party government as
it is understood in a democracy. It is ab-

NEWSWEEK
solutism of party over the nation and of
the leader over the party.

The President is familiar with party history and methods, and it may not be an
impertinence to suggest that a party does
not live on any such principle. It lives in
the integrity of its members—of the rank
and file as well as of the officers. It lives
in the courage of men who would willingly suffer defeat for public office rather than
compromise their obligation to their conscience and who would rather see their
party tossed out of power than see it tarnished. It lives in the confidence which the
man in the street has for the party's candidates for President, for Congress and for
the local justice of the peace. That allegiance cannot be held by the sort of men
who can be harnessed. No small part of
the public confidence the President enjoys
—a confidence which drew to his side in
1932 uncompromising men of ideals—rested upon a reputation which he made as
a member of the New York Legislature by
defying his party leaders. Add to that his
vote in 1904 against his party candidate
for President. The nonconformist curate
now wears the mitre!

Such is the party issue this momentous summer and autumn, which raises, in
its wake, a larger—a constitutional—issue.
The Congress of the United States is, under the Constitution and within its sphere,
a supreme authority. It was purposely
made so by wise men. One of those men,
later holding office as President, scrupulously withheld his influence from Congressional elections. George Washington said
in a letter under date of September 26,
1792, to John Francis Mercer:

"I come now to another part of your
letter, and in touching upon it, do not
scruple to declare to you that I was not a
little displeased to find by a letter from
Capt. Campbell to a gentleman in this
neighborhood, that my name had been
freely used by you or your friends for
electioneering purposes, when I had never
associated your name and the election together; and when there had been the most
scrupulous and pointed caution observed
on my part, not to express a sentiment respecting the fitness or unfitness of any candidate for representative that could be
construed, by the most violent torture of
the words, into an interference in favor
of one, or to the prejudice of another.

"Conceiving that the exercise of an influence (if I really possess any) however
remote would be improper; as the people
ought to be entirely at liberty to choose
whom they pleased to represent them in
Congress...

"I instantly declared to the person who
showed me the letter...That such a
measure would have been incompatible
with the rule I had prescribed to myself,
and which I had invariably observed, of
not interfering directly or indirectly, with
the suffrages of the people, in the choice
of their representatives..."
