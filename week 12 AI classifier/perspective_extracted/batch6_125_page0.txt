would elect two electors in addition likewise pledged to one of the candidates. This would strengthen our system of representative government because it would underline the importance of the Congressional district while preserving the interest that small states have in their relative strength in the Senate. It should be very popular in the South for it would preserve the integrity of their states. Its superiority to the present system can be most vividly shown by considering the case of New York. A handful of voters can throw those 45 electoral votes one way or the other. That is more than 17 per cent of the minimum number which is necessary under the present system to elect a President.

ONLY three times in 70 years has a candidate been elected without the vote of New York. And New York has no real majority party. The present governor owes his office to the splinter Liberal Party. That party is likely to decide nine out of ten statewide elections. Consider what might happen with branches of such a splinter party in a number of other large states. All two-party responsibility would be lost. The foundations of republican government would be swept away by something miscalled democracy. The Coudert-Mundt amendment would be safe insurance against such a peril.
