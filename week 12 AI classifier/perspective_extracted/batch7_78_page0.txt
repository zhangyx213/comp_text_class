The Incredible Alger Hiss
by RAYMOND MOLEY

MONTHS have added up to years
since the name of Alger Hiss was
first associated with Communist espio-
nage. Vast expanses of newsprint have
carried the details of the investigation
and of the inexorable grind of the ju-
dicial mill. Only those whose business
it was to follow and record the events
could comprehend the connected
story, and upon that select few there
was imposed not only by
law but by journalism's code
of ethics the duty not to
draw the fatal inferences.

Now, with the case de-
cided by a jury verdict, the
inferences can be drawn
and the lessons stated. But
even before these are pos-
sible, the story itself must
be restated, summarized,
and clarified. That first task
-no simple one-has been done by
two indefatigable reporters, Ralph de
Toledano of NEWSWEEK and Victor
Lasky of The New York World Tele-
gram and The Sun, in a NEWSWEEK
Bookshelf book, "Seeds of Treason,"
subtitled "The True Story of the Hiss-
Chambers Tragedy."*

This volume is no mere reprint of
the day-to-day accounts. It is a care-
fully articulated story, the selectivity
of which has provided in sequence
the high spots and highlights of evi-
dence, so woven and interpreted as
to provide not only vital history but
moving drama.

This was accomplished only be-
cause the two authors, long before
the Hiss case broke into print, spent
years in the essential preparation of
delving into the twisted byways of
Communist intrigue and espionage.
They have well served their country
and their profession.

This book has brought some clear
conclusions in my own wondering
about the case. Many times, when
asked for an opinion on Hiss, I have
had to answer that it was hard to be-
lieve in his guilt. I could have under-
stood a cynical lack of morality in a
young man who grew up in an atmos-
phere where ancient homilies were a
subject of ridicule and where tradition
bore a heavy burden of proof. For I
had seen many such vainglorious skep-
tics in vital governmental spots in the
early New Deal days. But here, it
seemed, was a man of proved intelli-
gence, too realistic to lend himself to
a shabby conspiracy to destroy the
indestructible and too keenly intent
on success to take so great a risk.
But the verdict is that he liquidated
his morality, whatever it was, in a
wash of muddy half truths about soci-
ety, politics, and economics.
He and those who pro-
moted his career mistook a
superficial capacity to par-
rot learning for fundamental
wisdom and judgment. For
Hiss was not only dishonest
but-perhaps in his mind a
greater fault-he was dumb.
The authors of this book
properly give great credit
to three or four actors in the
case. Rep. Richard M. Nixon emerges
as the man who snatched the investi-
gation from apparent frustration and
defeat. There were also the two Toms
-Donegan, a trained investigator and
lawyer who carried a heavy burden
in the grand - jury hearings, and
Murphy, who brilliantly conducted
the prosecution in the trials.

It is impossible to close the book on
the Hiss case without comparing his
status and conduct with that of Judith
Coplon. An instructor at Barnard Col-
lege who knew Miss Coplon says that
the young woman as a student con-
stantly complained that people did
not like her. Common sense will sug-
gest Miss Coplon might have con-
sidered how much she was loved and
cared for by the country she so badly
served. Both Hiss and Miss Coplon
were raised in the lap of special priv-
ilege. They were educated in insti-
tutions provided by the profits of the
very economic system that Commu-
nism is determined to destroy.

Let us be slow in condemning our
educational system for these failures.
These people were exceptional. But
it may well be considered by those
who direct higher education in Amer-
ica whether there is not a need to re-
examine their responsibilities and the
way they are carried out. The danger
is not that there is too much taught
about what is right in Communism,
but that there is too little taught
about what is right in America.
