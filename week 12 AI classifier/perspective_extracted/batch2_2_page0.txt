**THE ILL-KEPT CITY**

**BY RAYMOND MOLEY**

In November 1964, Barry Goldwater received 800,000 votes in New York City. I believe that a large majority of those voters favored him because they shared his principles or were traditional Republicans who believed they should vote for the choice of their party even if they disagreed with some of the candidate's ideas. A smaller number voted for Goldwater for various reasons which need not concern us here.

In this fall's election in New York City a considerable number of Goldwater voters will vote for John V. Lindsay for mayor. He is and has been at least a nominal Republican. Those who voted for Goldwater not only because he was the Republican candidate but because they were dedicated to his views are the concern of this article. Their problem in facing a choice is complex. They do not like Lindsay's liberal views and his affiliation with the Liberal Party. Should they vote—as a protest against both the Democrat Abraham Beame and the liberal Lindsay—for William F. Buckley Jr.? Or should they vote for Lindsay because he offers a better chance to improve the government of New York City?

**BUCKLEY ATTRACTIVE**

Voters more often vote against something than for something. Is it wise for a conservative to vote a protest against both Lindsay and Beame and thus chastise Lindsay for his liberalism?

This course has certain attractions. Buckley is an eloquent, interesting and provocative young man. One need not subscribe to his extreme oversimplification of national issues to realize that he is reminding us of tested and tried American values which have been too generally obscured in recent years. Buckley is also an inspiration to thousands of young people who must grapple with the bitter harvest of this generation's indiscretions and errors. For that reason I am glad he is preaching his gospel in a city that has need of such a reminder. I say this despite my conviction, often publicly expressed, that a splinter Conservative Party in New York is undesirable.

Politically, New York State is sui generis among American states, largely because of the vast and variegated population of New York City and its special and peculiar interests. The conservative who lives here is compelled to accept the liberal tinge in its Republican office-holders and in its laws and customs. The Conservative Party cannot cure that, but merely contributes to the success of Democratic candidates, since Buckley cannot be elected.

**DEMOCRATIC MESS**

The election of Beame would assure a continuation of the incredibly incompetent government New Yorkers have had for twenty years. We have had about all of it that we can stand. Consider the bungling that has created a water shortage when there flows close by one of the great rivers of the world, which could have been tapped years ago somewhere to the north. Consider also the lawlessness that makes our streets and parks unsafe for decent citizens and their children, the mess in school administration, the traffic impasse, the rickety mass-transport system, the defective tax laws which yield the richest city in the world less revenue than is needed for self-support, and also the growing tendency to depend upon Federal handouts. No. The Beame prospect is intolerable.

The election of Beame would, after the elimination of Robert Wagner, deliver New York over as a fief to our carpet-bag senator, Robert F. Kennedy.

We can expect no miracles if Lindsay is elected. He is no La Guardia. His campaign promises are lamentable and would shackle him to minority interests if elected mayor. But, if elected, he could at the very least have access to individuals of administrative talent who normally would shun office. We should have better commissioners, better boards and a shake-up all along the line—for a couple of years at least.

Conservatives need not worry about Lindsay's going to a higher office if elected. For no mayor of New York has gone up there for more than a century. The office has been the end, not the beginning, of political careers. And we might get a better Republican congressman in his vacated seat.
