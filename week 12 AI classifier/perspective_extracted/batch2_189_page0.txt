**PERSPECTIVE**

**Parties and Principles I**

**by Raymond Moley**

THERE lingers in the minds of many Americans an assumption, born long ago, that there is no essential difference between the two political parties. They say: "How can a party stand for any principle when it has members of such divergent views as Goldwater and Javits? Or Thurmond and Morse?" But the exceptions do not prove the assumption.

The essential cohesion within both parties is proved by a thoroughly documented study by a highly reliable private research agency, which I am privileged to summarize here. Seven years ago I commented on a study of the votes in the 83rd Congress by the same agency. The present one deals with the 1961 session of the 87th Congress. This study of voting records on roll calls is much more comprehensive than those made by the COPE, the ADA, or the ACA which consider less than twenty roll calls. It covers 115 roll calls in the Senate and 40 in the House.

It shows how members voted on issues involving the centralization and enlargement of the power of the Federal government, fiscal responsibility and spending, and the intervention of government in labor relations and the private economy. Thus it shows the relative standing of members in a broad spectrum from liberalism to conservatism in the sense in which those words are currently used. It does not include votes on foreign affairs except where the foregoing domestic matters are involved, nor civil rights nor procedural matters. Unlike the studies mentioned above, it realizes that votes on vital amendments are more significant than on the final passage of bills.

**IDEOLOGICAL SPECTRUM**

I have divided the members of the two houses as they rank in the spectrum into three groups. In the Senate there are 32 members in the more conservative group. Of these, 24 are Republicans and eight are Democrats. In the middle group there are nine Republicans and seven Democrats. In the more liberal group there are two Republicans—Javits, and Case of New Jersey—and 48 Democrats.

In the House there are 176 members in the more conservative group—155 of whom are Republicans, and 21 Democrats. In the middle group there are 31 members, of whom thirteen are Republicans and eighteen are Democrats. In the more liberal group there are four Republicans and 217 Democrats. Missing from the compilation are members who served only during a part of the session.

Thus, on those issues of substantial ideological significance there is a concentration of Republicans in the conservative and of Democrats in the liberal sectors. It is very marked in this Congress, far more than in any period in modern times. And so there is a specific choice in principle between the two parties.

**LIVING WITH ECCENTRICS**

The lesson in this is clear to conservatives and liberals who choose to shun party allegiance. There is a lesson also for those who call themselves "independent" because of their claim that "there is no difference" or because they have no political principles or are just plain timid. There is a party which they can join and work and vote for. There is no valid argument for such abstentions. Those who do abstain are gravely injuring the vitality and health and success of a two-party system.

So far as deviationist members of the two parties are concerned, the foregoing figures show how truly exceptional they are and how little they affect the party of which they are only nominal members. But a big party can live with its eccentrics just as do religious bodies, nationalities, races, college faculties, and clubs.

Because of the traditional conditions in the South, there are more deviators in the Democratic Party than among the Republicans. This is shown in the study, although issues involving racial relations are not included.

These figures should show all reasonable conservatives that they can and should find a party home in the Republican Party. Those who remain irreconcilable cannot be charged against the Republican Party. They must remain hopeless but impotent.

Next week I shall name the leading conservative and liberal members of both parties and state certain further conclusions to be derived from this most important study.
