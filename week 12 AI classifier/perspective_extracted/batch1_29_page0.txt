**PERSPECTIVE**

**THOSE 25 GOP GOVERNORS**

**BY RAYMOND MOLEY**

This piece and the one which will
follow next week are designed
to establish a number of propositions
which bear upon the conference of
25 Republican governors and governors-elect at Colorado Springs on
Dec. 9-10.

1. The aggregate influence of the
states represented by those governors may well be sufficiently large to
win the Presidency for a Republican
candidate in 1968.

2. There is in sight of attainment a
genuine two-party system, fairly
evenly balanced, which is good for
the country and for the people of
the country.

3. There is a real issue upon which
the Republican Party can depend
which conforms with the constitutional framework of the republic.

4. The recent election should be
interpreted as terminating the divisive forces which shattered the GOP
in 1964. For there were elected in
November a good representation of
all those ideological groups in the
party which confused the electorate
in that unhappy year and gave an excessive and unwholesome monopoly
of power to the President, his Congressional majority and his party.

5. The peril which those 25 governors must avoid and resist is the effort of Democratic leaders and the traditional practices of the daily press
and television and radio networks to
create the image of a divided and internally irreconcilable GOP.

The last of those propositions is illustrated by three successive headlines in The New York Times. On
Nov. 20: ROCKEFELLER CALLS GOP
GOVERNORS PARTY'S '68 HOPE. And
in the story that followed, the New
York governor stated that he favored
a "consensus" of Republicans. The
next day the headline was ROMNEY
ATTACKS ROCKEFELLER PLAN ON 1968
STRATEGY. That day Rockefeller and
Romney met, and the next Times
headline said ROMNEY ENDORSES GOP
CONSENSUS AS A PRINCIPLE. The two
governors thus pricked that bubble
of dissent. The difference was purely
semantic and irrelevant.

But the effort to divide will not
end with this agreement. The practice of some elements of the press
and of the networks can be summarized as "Let's you and him have a
fight and I'll hold the microphone."
In my Yankee grandmother's phrase,
it might be called "puddin' stick"
reporting.

Rockefeller in his interview reported on Nov. 20 said that while he
did not care for the LBJ word "consensus" he used it to describe a state
of harmony among Republicans as
they looked toward 1968. He used
the word "pragmatic" to describe
this. And he added that speculation
now about 1968 candidates would be
"premature."

In short, Republicans during the
next nineteen months should not be
preoccupied with who will be the
1968 nominee, but with how a Republican nominee can be elected.

**NO IDEOLOGICAL TREND**

After six years in the wilderness of
defeat and frustration, the Republican opportunity is very bright indeed.
The states in which Republicans will
have governors next year encompass
more than 100 million people. The
electoral votes of their states will be
more than 300, or about 50 more than
is necessary to elect a President. If
we assume that half of the ten states
with holdover Democratic governors
would have been carried by Republicans, the GOP electoral vote would
be in excess of 100 more than necessary to elect a President. In Illinois,
the largest of those states, Republicans won control of both houses of
the legislature.

The results of this 1966 election
show neither a so-called "liberal" nor
"conservative" trend. The range runs
from Rockefeller and Chafee in the
East to Reagan and Williams of Arizona in the West, with Percy, Rhodes
and Romney in between.

Republican prospects can be darkened by two circumstances: first, the
reopening of the old 1964 wounds;
second, the failure of the 25 GOP
governors, in cooperation with the
GOP in Congress, to provide good
government at all levels.

By good government I mean stemming the tide of Federal invasion of
the states and the great urban areas
by sound methods in the states for
meeting the needs of their people.
This is a question of money and fiscal
policy which I shall consider in another article.
