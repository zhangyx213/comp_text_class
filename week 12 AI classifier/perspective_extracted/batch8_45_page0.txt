**Collective Bargainingâ€”A War Casualty**

by RAYMOND MOLEY

The edifice of collective bargaining was long in the building. Countless workers laid the stones. Many architects, some of them government architects in the past nine or ten years, worked on the plans. But now as we gather to dedicate the structure of collective bargaining, it has vanished. Perhaps Father Malachy has been around with another miracle. Or maybe, like the legendary city on the coast of Cornwall, it has sunk beneath the waves, though its bell can still be heard on a quiet evening.

Something else is on the site, however. In the place of the edifice of collective bargaining, there stands the administration of wages.

It is still possible for unions to draw up wage demands and present them to their employers. It is still legal for employers to discuss them. The law, in fact, requires employers to consider them where they are submitted by the duly authorized representatives of their employees. But as for granting wage demands or reaching an agreement giving workers a wage increase, the old essence of bargaining has been transferred to the National War Labor Board. And the board doesn't bargain. It decides.

The discovery of the fact that most of the substance of collective bargaining has gone takes time. The short duration of strikes these days is evidence that it requires a day or two for unions or "unauthorized" or "wildcat" strikers to find that collective bargaining, as they understood it, has disappeared. One of the latest examples is the strike of employees of the National Malleable & Steel Castings Co. in Cleveland. They had been engaged in "bargaining" for some months. An arbitrator decided that a clause in the union contract providing for negotiation of wage increases after rises in the cost of living did not, of itself, require the company to grant them. Prof. William W. Dawson then investigated for the National War Labor Board. He decided that the men were not entitled to their demands because they had had increases amounting to 21 per cent in the last two years. Professor Dawson has been a sincere advocate of collective bargaining, is regarded in Cleveland as a liberal and has long had the confidence of people on the numerous Washington boards which look after labor. Dissatisfied, the Malleable employees struck. But in less than 24 hours they had the usual notice from the NWLB that their case would get no consideration until they went back to work. Whereupon they voted to return.

Yes, bargaining is gone. What is left is neither bargaining nor truly collective. Where unions present arguments for a wage increase to the WLB, they merely act as reporters or surveyors. The requests are checked by the WLB's own investigators. In that sense, all that is left of collective bargaining is the machinery by which requests for higher wages are transmitted to the people who make the decisions. Beyond this, faint traces of the old style collective bargaining do remain in the settlement of grievances, but most of these cases are individual.

Meanwhile, NLRB is sinking into innocuous desuetude.

And the union leader must scratch hard to justify his salary. Perhaps some of that scratching is found in the "maintenance-of-membership" idea. But as union members discover the vanishing importance of their officers, they may become more and more intolerant of the burden of supporting them in the style to which they have become accustomed. Some of these officials will seek government jobs. Others will try to provide themselves with a new source of employment in the so-called labor-representation-in-management. But no one will waste sympathy on them. They invited the government to sup at their table, and if the giant now consumes all the food, they will have to forage somewhere else.

Will the institution of collective bargaining reappear after the war? In some form or other doubtless it will. But any reasonable answer underlines the fact that millions of returning soldiers will be sure to put pressure upon the government; to relax a condition in which government, by encouraging maintenance-of-membership, has guaranteed union leaders a hold on their members.

Whether returning able-bodied men can be bought off by government subsidies when their real need will be jobs is something to worry both politicians and union leaders these days.
