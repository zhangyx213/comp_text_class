**Perspective**

**A Sleeping Dog**

That New Dealers have no intention of giving up their belief that life-insurance companies should invest in common stocks was demonstrated last week when, in hearings held by a New York State legislative committee, SEC Commissioner Sumner T. Pike aired his views once more. New York's able Superintendent of Insurance, Lewis H. Pink, raised impressive objections. Executives of three big companies were dubious or opposed. Further inquiry was put over until next year. So, for the moment, this dog sleeps again.

Behind the scheme, in the first instance, is the concern some New Dealers have had over the failure of venture capital to flow into business. They have long been worried about the fact that individual investors do not wish to put their savings into common stocks. Apparently, therefore, they want to correct the difficulty by "channeling" savings entrusted to insurance companies into common stocks. They will not acknowledge the real reason why individual investors have shown so little interest in common stocks during recent years. They will not recognize that governmental policies have impaired confidence in the future of this kind of investment.

The solution must be the restoration of confidence. It is not the palliative of using insurance funds to make good the failure of venture capital to flow. But to admit that this vital failure has been caused by lack of confidence is to admit that government itself is responsible for the drying up of venture capital. And such an admission will call for a drastic revision of the policies that are at the root of the trouble.

**Pig Iron Is Pig Iron**

Three weeks ago this page pointed out that the planners of the much-heralded 10,000,000-ton expansion of steel-ingot capacity had made an error in their calculations so serious that of itself it promised to bar the way to steel expansion. They had neglected to contract for the scores of new lake ships that will be required to transport the ore needed to create and supply the proposed new facilities. Now it appears that they have overlooked another small matter in their expansion plans. They have neglected to plan for enough blast-furnace capacity to produce the pig iron that the new facilities will require if they are to make steel.

It is true that on July 23, months before the steel-ingot expansion was approved, a program providing for an increase of 6,500,000 tons in blast-furnace or pig-iron capacity was announced. Many people, including some pretty close to the steel industry, think of this blast-furnace expansion and the subsequently announced steel-ingot expansion as being complementary. They are not. The blast-furnace expansion was principally intended to make up for the shortage of scrap that was apparent as the existing steel mills continued their high rate of operations. So the 6,500,000-ton blast-furnace-expansion plans would plainly produce almost no pig iron for making steel in any new steel mills.

Now, under normal conditions, if you were planning a 10,000,000-ton expansion of steel-ingot capacity, you would count on needing 5,000,000 additional tons of scrap supply yearly and 5,000,000 additional tons of pig-iron capacity. You would figure that way because roughly an equal amount of pig iron and scrap usually goes into ingots. So, along with the plans for a 10,000,000-ton expansion of steel-ingot capacity, a 5,000,000-ton expansion of pig-iron capacity was automatically planned. Or, to talk in terms that have some relation to facts and not to fantasy, the 2,500,000-ton steel-ingot expansion for which financing has actually been arranged to date, according to Jesse Jones, presumably provides for a 1,250,000-ton expansion of pig-iron capacity. But even if it has so provided, that 1,250,000-ton pig-iron expansion will not provide enough pig iron to enable the new 2,500,000-ton-capacity steel-ingot plants to turn out steel.

How do we know that? We know it because we know that there is a painful shortage of scrap. To the extent that scrap is not available, a greater proportion of pig iron must be used in turning out steel ingots. It was largely to make up for the deficit in scrap consumed by existing steel mills that the 6,500,000 tons of new pig-iron capacity was planned. It is evident, then, that the proportions traditionally allotted to pig-iron capacity and steel-ingot capacity in the past were thrown out of kilter when the scrap shortage showed up. If they had not been, it would have been unnecessary to provide more pig-iron capacity. Yet so far as is known, the new plans provide for pig-iron capacity and steel-ingot capacity in the same proportions as those which existed in the steel industry before the scrap shortage appeared. Which means that current plans will produce an insufficient pig-iron capacity.

Well, then, can the 1,250,000-ton expansion of pig-iron capacity presumably designed to provide pig iron for the new 2,500,000-ton steel-ingot expansion be supplemented out of the 6,500,000-ton expansion of pig-iron capacity announced last July? It cannot. To repeat, that 6,500,000-ton expansion was planned largely so that existing steel-plant capacity could continue at its present level of operations. The OPM recognized at the time that expansion was announced that, if steel-ingot capacity was to be expanded, a "still larger increase in pig-iron capacity would be necessary". Moreover, there is the stubborn fact that the demand for pig iron for uses other than steelmaking has been expanding under wartime requirements. When, therefore, the need for pig iron that does not go into steel increases, and the need for pig iron that is consumed by existing steel plants also increases, it does not seem probable that there will be any left-overs from the 6,500,000-ton pig-iron capacity expansion to meet the requirements created by new steel-ingot plant.

One last fact remains to complete the picture of muddling. There isn't going to be a 6,500,000-ton expansion of pig-iron capacity after all. On October 22, Jesse Jones announced that the total of new pig-iron capacity to be financed by the government was only 5,400,000 tons. He declared that expansion of this particular type was pretty close to completion. At one time, he explained, the OPM had talked about 6,500,000 tons. But it had "never been specific."

Pig iron is scarcely a subject for vague musings. When a pig-iron shortage appears it is going to be one of the most uncomfortably specific facts that the Administration has ever faced.

**Not A Defense Measure**

John Love of The Cleveland Press keeps a more than watchful eye on business doings on our northern border. He has recently made two keen observations about the still kicking St. Lawrence project. Why, he asks, does the Administration still favor building a great power project there when the War Department has announced that it will put no ordnance plants east and north of Euclid and Ravenna, Ohio, because they would be in a vulnerable area?

And why does the Administration favor canalizing the St. Lawrence for big ships when canal traffic dwindles during wars? In the last war traffic on existing St. Lawrence canals declined. It is going down now. Traffic through the Panama Canal is also dropping. That is because canal traffic is too slow for war necessities. Ships can't afford to spend the time that canals require. Other and faster means of transportation must be used whenever possible. Add these new ones to the long list of reasons why the St. Lawrence project is not a real defense measure.
