**After Wisconsin**

by RAYMOND MOLEY

CHICAGO—As this is written, after
the Wisconsin primary and on the
eve of the Nebraska and Illinois primaries, between 325 and 350 delegates
have been selected for the Republican
national convention. These are from
New Hampshire, North Carolina,
Minnesota, Louisiana, Kansas, Maine,
Iowa, Arizona, Michigan, New York,
Wisconsin, South Carolina, Virginia and
Arkansas. A great majority
of these delegates are not
instructed. In cases where
they are, the commitments
are of every degree of moral,
legal and political obligation.
Hence, it would be impossible
to make a nice tabulation
of each candidate. The managers
of the various candidates
will make claims, of
course, which deserve some discounting. But after a review of the available
facts, a few wholly detached and impartial estimates can be ventured.

At this time, I believe 135 delegates,
from New Hampshire, North Carolina,
Louisiana, Kansas and New York,
intend to vote for Dewey. Forty-seven,
from Wisconsin, Minnesota and New
Hampshire, intend to vote for Stassen.
Nineteen, from South Carolina, North
Carolina and Louisiana, intend to vote
for Taft. Eight from Wisconsin intend
to vote for MacArthur, and 41 from
Michigan intend to vote for Vandenberg, if he does not object too positively.
There is much dispute about the delegates selected in Maine, Iowa, Arizona,
Virginia and Arkansas. Claims greatly
overlap, but it is fair to say that Dewey
seems to have the edge in Iowa; Taft,
in Arkansas; with Stassen assured of
some in Iowa, Arizona and Maine.

UNTIL and including April 28, and in
this order, 287 delegates will be
chosen in Illinois, Nebraska, Idaho, Kentucky, New Jersey, New York (where
seven delegates-at-large remain to be
selected), Hawaii, Oklahoma, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Delaware.
If it is not easy to fathom the intentions
of delegates already chosen, it would be
foolish to guess at the intentions of
people who are not yet chosen. Some of
these states will have favorite sons who
will be convenient screens to hide real
intentions. The prospects for Dewey to
get a majority of delegates from Idaho,

Kentucky, Oklahoma and Delaware are
promising. Taft's prospects in the next
two weeks at the moment seem better
than those of Stassen.
That is about all the speculation I
can afford this week.
Perhaps my caution is enforced by
what happened in Wisconsin. Once
again, the voters zestfully beat down
the commentators, including this red-
faced scribe. It was that
way in 1944.
In any future speculation
on what may be the final
result, a few considerations
should be kept in mind.
Stassen's campaigning
over the past year was a
performance without parallel
in our political history. His
movements from state to
state were so fast that the
ordinary newspaper reader grasped no
idea of their magnitude. He has made
friends—thousands of them—and he
has made very few mistakes in conduct
or in speech. The record will show him
to have strength in many places where
it is not now expected.

ON the other hand, Taft has an advantage gained by the apparent
collapse of Democratic hopes. He is
known to be a good party man. He is
also known to senators and congress-
men as a commanding intellectual
leader, and they will be at the convention and will be powerful, especially in
a deadlocked convention.
Dewey's assets are his strength in
the polls, his administrative ability
and, most important and least recognized, the experience he and his
managers have gained in two previous
campaigns for the nomination. Every
one of our states and territories has its
known Republican leaders, its organizations and factions. To master the
Who's Who in all those places is a
stupendous task. The relations among
those leaders and factions, their personal interests and commitments must
be known. One must also know their
reliability and the value of their promises. The Dewey people have much of
that knowledge.
Wisconsin can and has injured the
Dewey prestige and has made many a
politician waver. But Dewey can stand
some setbacks and still be a formidable contender.
