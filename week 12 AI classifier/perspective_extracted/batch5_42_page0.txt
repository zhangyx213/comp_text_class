**Is T-H a Dead Letter?**

**by Raymond Moley**

ON Nov. 6 a jury in Judge Frank A.
Picard's Federal district court in
Detroit acquitted the UAW on an in-
dictment charging the union with a
violation of the Taft-Hartley legisla-
tion, which forbids a "labor organiza-
tion" to make a "contribution" or
"expenditure" in connection with a
Federal election, primary, or conven-
tion. The specific charge was the
financing of a series of television pro-
grams in 1954 on which various Dem-
ocratic candidates and also Walter
Reuther appeared.

This indictment was thrown out by
Judge Picard in 1955 but was rein-
stated by the Supreme Court earlier
this year.

After the acquittal, the U.S. Attor-
ney in charge of the case stated that,
in view of trial Judge Picard's instruc-
tions to the jury, no prosecution could
succeed under the statute in a like
set of facts. The U.S. Attorney might
have added that under any judge
who would give such instructions, an
acquittal would be inevitable. He
might also have said that any jury
which could harbor such fantastic
ideas of what the law meant as were
given to the press by members of this
jury would acquit in any like case.

**RIVERS OF MONEY**

If this statute is a dead letter, we
shall see chaos and corruption of the
electoral process in this country which
may impair not only our two-party
system but our basic political system.
For under this interpretation of the
law, the 1907 prohibition upon corpo-
rations is also a dead letter. Thus we
might have money flowing like water
not only from the huge union treas-
uries, but from corporations as well.
Anyone in practical politics will tell
you that getting money and workers
under the old voluntary system is be-
coming more and more difficult. Individuals have less and less after
taxes, and those who would be able
and disposed to give will fear a
smearing by partisan investigating
committees. Hence, individuals able
to give would welcome the more
anonymous device of corporation donations and expenditures.

Mr. Justice Frankfurter said in his
opinion reinstating the UAW indict-
ment last March: "What is involved
here is the integrity of our electoral
process, and, not less, the responsibil-
ity of the individual citizen for the
successful functioning of that proc-
ess." Indeed, the individual citizen
might be submerged completely in
the clash of great collective aggrega-
tions of wealth. There are several reasons why Congressional action for any
amendment of the law on the narrow
ground of prohibiting union and corporation political expenditures cannot
hopefully be anticipated.

**RIGHT-TO-WORK REMEDY**

In the first place, three and perhaps more Justices of the Supreme
Court would throw out such prohibitions because of the free-speech provisions of the First Amendment. Also,
the union leaders have cleverly
blurred the distinction between propaganda concerning legislation on matters directly affecting labor's interests
and advocacy of a general political
program. Third, the unions, by the
adoption of the "contracting out" rigmarole now employed by the UAW,
may lend sufficient "voluntary" color
to expenditures that gullible jurors
will fail to convict. "Contracting out,"
a British term, means that unless a
union member specifically says his
dues should not be used in politics,
the leaders may use all or part of it
in that way.

Finally, Federal legislation cannot
control what is done in state and local
elections. A perfectly easy way for
the unions to achieve control of the
House of Representatives is to win
enough State Legislatures so that
after the reapportionment in 1960 the
Democratic Party can pick up a permanent majority in that body.

The only permanent answer is to
limit the privileges and immunities of
the unions under present law. For the
political power of unions inevitably
depends upon the union shop, under
which the leaders are able to use the
general funds and manpower of the
unions to capture state Democratic
organizations and then to capture the
governments thereof, such as has already happened in Michigan.

The establishment of the worker-
citizen's right to work is the way to
free the citizen-worker as a factor in
the political process.
