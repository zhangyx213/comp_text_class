**PERSPECTIVE**

**Unfair U.S. Competition**

*by Raymond Moley*

The devastating competition to which the United States parcel-post system is subjecting package and small-shipment carriers suggests the old story of the well-mauled boxer. Between rounds his manager told him: "Get in there and fight. That bum can't hit you!" The boxer said feebly: "Then watch that referee. Somebody's knocking my brains out." Fourth-class parcel post originated amid sweet pastoral pipings and rural scenes, just after rural free delivery, under William H. Taft. It was to supplement Railway Express Agency, now REA Express, and other private carriers by providing a means of getting Farmer Jones' eggs to town and bringing back small items in the mail. It was to be self-supporting. Further, it was not to hurt the railway carriers of heavier stuff. A weight of 11 pounds and a package of 72 inches (length and girth) were the limits. Thereafter the bureaucrats and politicians in the top Post Office positions took over. Inevitably, expansion, mismanagement, and deficits followed. From 1913 to 1931 the weight limit rose to 70 pounds and the size to 100 inches. The vanishing farmer still sends and receives his little bundles. But parcel-post shipments have become largely commercial and in the main move between the nation's cities. Immense mail-order houses grew up, the happy beneficiaries of continuing subsidies in the form of Post Office deficits. The beguiled citizen, happy with his new gadget fresh from the mail-order house, failed to realize that he was paying in taxes part of its cost.

**DEADLY SUBSIDIES**

Over the years from 1926 to 1960 the total deficits in fourth-class mail have been $1.5 billion. But there are other hidden costs to the taxpayer. There are government-owned buildings, motor vehicles borrowed from other agencies, contributions to such civil-service payments as pensions, and other items. In one year these amounted to a third of the deficit. Therefore, the total cost of this subsidized operation in 35 years was probably close to $2 billion. In 1951 the railroads and REA Express proved to Congress that they could not endure this competition in heavy and large items, and Public Law 199 was passed. In this law Congress sought to check the bureaucracy and fixed the maximum of parcel post at 20 pounds and 70 inches. In the Congressional testimony before this bill was passed, Postmaster General Donaldson, the most efficient occupant of that office in half a century, pointed out that to permit heavy freight to be carried by mail would involve prohibitive costs. "The stuff," he said, should be "channeled back to the express."

For a while the railroads and REA rallied. But the old trend continued, and hundreds of millions in parcel-post deficits piled up. The Hoover commission recommended that the proper way to erase deficits was to raise the rates. This would relieve the taxpayers and permit fairer competition by the carriers.

**A BUREAUCRAT'S DEFIANCE**

In a few short months the New Frontier's Postmaster General Day caught the infection of his bureaucracy. He turned to the disproved and discredited proposition that if the parcel-post volume were increased, the deficit would decrease. His resulting proposal, now before the ICC, would put freight back up to 50 pounds and 100 inches between first-class post offices-cities adequately linked by private carriers. Perhaps, since the bureaucracy in this department has defied the orders of Congress before, this proposal could take effect. But the Interstate Commerce Commission must be considered. Members of that body have indicated that they have read Public Law 199 with care and are not disposed to permit the Postmaster General to do what Congress has plainly prohibited. There is also the critical situation of the railroads, surrounded as they are by subsidized competition of other kinds. The way to remedy the situation is to eliminate the deficit-subsidy by raising the rates. That is what a private business must do to keep alive. But a business conducted by government enjoys an immortality conferred by access to the Treasury and the pockets of all taxpayers.
