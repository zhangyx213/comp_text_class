**'Giveaway'—to Whom?**
by Raymond Moley

A thin, shrill complaining theme runs through most of the political discourse opposed to the Eisenhower Administration. It is the accusation that this Administration is "giving away" the great natural resources—minerals, timber, waterpower—the heritage of "the people"—to certain people who because they are in business are therefore rascals. The assets involved are thus "lost" to "the people" forever. A conservative Administration, it is asserted, does not conserve. It dissipates and destroys. This political routine is an effort to raise the ghosts of long ago, when there were real rascals and when our resources were truly wasted and given away. Government then was not only wayward but wayless.

**CONSERVE, NOT HOARD**

Back there, at the turn of the century, the "conservation" movement was born, and T.R. became its major exponent. The preservation of the public domain became a major concern of the Federal government. Over the years hundreds of laws were made to regulate the use of our resources by private persons and agencies who sought legitimately to develop them. The conservation movement was not designed to keep these resources in sterile hoarding, with an expensive bureaucracy to guard them. Nor did anyone then propose that the government itself go into the mining, electric-power, timber, or grazing businesses.

The rewards for government through regulated private use are very considerable. There are the prices paid in the form of royalties or other forms of compensation. There are the vacant spots in the vast domain to be occupied by farmers, workers, industries, towns, and cities. There is the property created and the people drawn to the region on which the various governments, local, state, and Federal, levy taxes.

However, for two decades after the great depression politicians made business and businessmen the objects of derision and attack. Many members of the Roosevelt-Truman Administrations and their supporters in Congress leaned toward Federal collectivism. Notable among these were men such as Harold Ickes and Henry Wallace, who occupied key positions in the administration of natural resources. Under them there grew up a bureaucracy impregnated with the Ickes-Wallace philosophy. Despite the change of party control in 1953 and the declaration in the new, Eisenhower philosophy that the cold war between business and government should end, the old bureaucracy held over. Many members of that bureaucracy have found common cause with collectivist, public-ownership politicians in Congress, and a number of "giveaway" charges have emerged which are being actively exploited by the various aspirants for the Democratic nomination and by former President Truman.

In a number of previous articles in this space I have indicated in some detail the frivolous nature of these charges. In the Hells Canyon case Congress had repeatedly refused to build a Federal dam, and after a year and a half of hearings the Federal Power Commission granted a license to the Idaho Power Co. to build three dams, the cost to go to private investors. The Al Sarena case has apparently blown up on the face of the Senate subcommittee which investigated it. In the case of the tidelands, the Federal government never had title to give away. Congress, under the initiative and strong support of Democrats, merely clarified the title of the states, which the Supreme Court had temporarily clouded.

**AN INDEFENSIBLE CHARGE**

"The indefensible character of the 'giveaway' charge is easy to see. It does not openly assert, but it is intended to convey the absurd idea that there should be no private development of natural resources, even with legally prescribed regulation. It also insinuates, without proof from any source, that there has been some lack of integrity on the part of the policymaking officials responsible for the administration of those resources. In short, that the Eisenhower Administration, because it has sought and obtained the services of successful men of business, is a false trustee and a crooked guardian of property belonging to the American people.
