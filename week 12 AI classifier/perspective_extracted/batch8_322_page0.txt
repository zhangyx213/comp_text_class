**Perspective**

**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

**Stopping the Panic**

No wise man would attempt to
foretell how far the business pessimism of
these days will go and what depths of
business demoralization will be reached be-
fore the upswing comes again. But in the
past few weeks there have appeared a
number of dire prophets who seem to
want to hasten the melancholy end they
prophesy. Thus one of them predicts an
international collapse that will carry us
into the most profound of all depressions.
When this comes—and it will be precipi-
tate, he says—political forms as we have
known them will vanish: there will be no
Democratic and Republican parties by
1940. Beyond the collapse, his vision grows
dim. Maybe it is fascism, maybe some-
thing else that lies in store.

Such men are probably sincere. Perhaps
they should speak their doubts freely. Cer-
tainly no one should try to deny them
that privilege. But those who do not agree
with them have a public obligation, at a
time like this, to express their disagree-
ment vehemently and persistently. That
disagreement, I, for one, feel.

It is true that a minor panic is in the
making. But there is no reason for assum-
ing that we cannot avoid a 1932 decline,
much less a complete economic collapse.
The proof of that is simple. The fear of
manufacturers that they can no longer
count on lower prices to produce a larger
volume of sales and, hence, greater profits
—which is the heart of our present dis-
contents—could be dissipated within a few
hours’ time. The President, who so proud-
ly said that we were prosperous because
his Administration had planned it that
way, could stop the panic.

I believe Mr. Roosevelt was right when
he said that the government was largely
responsible for recovery and, in so be-
lieving, I disassociate myself from those
who resisted the measures he sponsored in
1933 and 1934. Those who said then that
recovery would come without government
help are simply discrediting themselves in
the public mind when they now blame the
President for not acting. Most people be-
lieve that Mr. Roosevelt diagnosed the
situation correctly in 1933 when he said
that it was fear we had to fear, and I
believe that most people would applaud
him now if he took steps once more to
end the wave of fear that is rapidly
blanketing recovery.

What can be done? Congress and the
President can sweep away those obstacles
which are now paralyzing the flow of

private money into investment channels.
Those factors are: (1) the capital-gains
and undivided-profits taxes; (2) the un-
certain fate of the public utilities; (3) the
ICC’s failure to give the railroads a decent
living; (4) the high wages, high interest
rates and high material costs which have
blighted the movement for low-cost housing.

I do not believe the President will make
a move toward removing these obstacles
to recovery for some time. He is more apt
to permit the present wave of fear to con-
tinue, using it to force Congress to act on
crop control and wages and hours legis-
lation. After that, he may possibly take
action on these items. But there is no
reason for business to lose hope and yield
to the prophets of doom merely because
no cheering word will come from the
White House for a while. Congress may
really come to the rescue. There is an ex-
cellent chance that regardless of Presi-
dential strategy Congressional leaders will
make this a “Keep Up the Recovery”
session.


**The Meaning of the Elections**

How do last week’s elections fit
into the great crossword puzzle of national
politics? Out of a great many somewhat
contradictory facts, not one, but several
tentative conclusions emerge.

Only incidentally has the New York
City election national connotations. The
President was neutral, but it was no secret
that he admired and respected La Guardia.
On the other hand, Farley, Wagner and
Lehman supported Mahoney, the Demo-
cratic candidate. The President was thus
in a position to gain prestige and in-
fluence whichever way the election went.

The new American Labor party vote for
La Guardia points to an active future for
the party in New York. Ironically, the
Democrats will need its endorsement in
order to win next year’s gubernatorial
election.

The fact that the New York Assembly
went Republican is not particularly sig-
nificant. But it is significant that the Re-
publicans seized control of the forthcom-
ing Constitutional Convention by a sizable
majority and that most of the Democrats
who were elected are anti-New Deal
Democrats. Here was a matter involving a
straight party choice. The result suggests,
at any rate, a drift back toward the nor-

mal Republican vote in New York State.
The New Jersey omens are less am-
biguous. Senator Moore is an old favorite,
and his opponent was a relative new-
comer in politics. Moore was comfortably
elected by the enormous majority which
the Hague machine piled up in Jersey
City. But a Republican carried 14 of the
21 counties of the state whereas, in 1936,
Roosevelt carried 16. Note that in 1936
New Jersey was one of the three states in
which, despite its immense popular ma-
jority, the Democratic party did not lose
some of the total number of counties car-
ried in the 1932 election.

Taking New Jersey and New York to-
gether, therefore, it is a fair inference that
the return of a normal Republican vote
outside of the great cities has been ac-
celerating in the past year. Analysis of the
returns in Pennsylvania indicates that the
same tendency is shown there outside of
Pittsburgh. In Ohio, too, the return of
many small cities temporarily swept by
the Democrats to the Republican column
is noteworthy. In fact, what seems to be
the normal drift in New York, New Jersey
and Pennsylvania was accentuated in Ohio
by the resentment of the public against
the excesses of the C.I.O. there and by the
resentment against the reputed friendship
between the C.I.O. and the Administra-
tion. The election in Cleveland was not
particularly significant, although a reform
Republican was decisively reelected.

The Detroit election is interesting, not
so much because a C.I.O. candidate was
defeated, as because most private polls of
workers there taken before the election
indicated that the C.I.O. was stronger
than it actually proved to be. Apparently
many workers supported the C.I.O. in all
tests of sentiment which would publicize
their preferences, but rejected it in the
privacy of the voting booth.

All these straws point, I believe, to a
small though noticeable recession in New
Deal strength; the beginnings of a res-
toration of normal Republican majorities,
particularly in the rural districts; and
strong popular resentment against radical
action by the C.I.O. The vote in the large
cities indicates an ever-growing attach-
ment between the New Deal and the
urban masses and, at the same time, an
increasing dependence by the New Deal
upon the control of such great city ma-
chines as those of Hague, Guffey and
Kelly. This cannot be interpreted as a
good omen by those who hope to see the
budget balanced, for city majorities are
notoriously fickle and must be held by
tangible bounties. Nor can it be looked
upon with indifference by the Demo-
cratic high command, since increasing
Democratic dependence upon these fickle
city majorities seems to promise a re-
turning equilibrium between the two
parties.
