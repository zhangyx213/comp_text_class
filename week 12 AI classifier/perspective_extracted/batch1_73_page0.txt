**FREEDOM OF THE SEAS**

**BY RAYMOND MOLEY**

The title of this piece is one of those
nice expressions which idealistic
Americans, notably Woodrow Wilson
in World War I, used to refute the
claims of those who were interfering
with what we called our rights. But
for generations, especially since the
Battle of Trafalgar, such freedom existed
because Britain dominated the
sea lanes of the world, keeping them
free to commerce in peace but restricting
them in war. Now the United
States, with massive naval power, carries
that burden.

Yet we, the United States, are permitting
the ships of our friends in Europe
and Asia as well as the Soviet and
Red China to supply, through the
North Vietnamese port of Haiphong,
the goods of war to Hanoi and the
Viet Cong guerrillas. Our enemies are
enjoying the benefits of a license
which we have created. We are impaled
upon a legal "principle" of our
own choosing.

It would be pleasant in this Christmas
season to divert this article to a
consideration of whether all freedoms
are not exercised only because a
dominant force has decreed them.
Kooks in our academic institutions
and elsewhere among us are able to
demonstrate against the government
of the United States only because
that government is strong enough to
keep at bay the Communist power
which would deny all freedoms.

**PACIFIC BLOCKADE**

The tragic plight of our forces in
Vietnam is mainly due to the free access
to North Vietnam by sea which
we have permitted. We have been
woefully wrong in mistaking freedom
of the seas for freedom of international
shipping to supply the Communist
aggression in South Vietnam.

When the Soviet, in and before
1962, used the sea lanes (which we
had the means of controlling) to
build a mortal threat to the United
States in Cuba, there were many, including
this writer, who said we
should impose a blockade. This was
met—until the President acted, after
missiles were installed there—by the
legalistic argument that a blockade is
an act of war; that since we were not
at war with Cuba, we could not deny
access to its ports. When it was
pointed out that there was something

called a "pacific blockade," it was
said that a pacific blockade was obsolete
and that the United States had
never recognized its legality.

Accordingly, Kennedy called his
defensive measures a "quarantine"
and limited the expression "contraband"
to "aggressive weapons."

But the legalists were wrong about
a pacific blockade. It was not obsolete,
and there is grave doubt
whether we ever denied its usefulness
or validity. The concept originated
in the nineteenth century and
was repeatedly used by Britain and
France against troublesome nations to
enforce their rights or to preserve the
peace of Europe—in 1824, 1837,
1884 and 1886. It was used in 1902
and 1903, by Germany and Britain at
first, and then by Germany alone to
bring to negotiation a Venezuelan
dictator whose name, incidentally,
was Castro. Later, during the European
war, Theodore Roosevelt told a
fantastic and quite inaccurate story
about the episode. We did not refuse
to recognize the right of Germany's
blockade.

**UNUSED NAVAL POWER**

A pacific blockade is a measure enforced
by a naval power against the
use of the ports of a nation with
which it is not legally at war. It could
be used now to prevent contraband
from entering Haiphong and thus cut
off military supplies which are being
used against our forces and those of
the South Vietnamese.

Perhaps the reason why naval
power is not being used is because
we hesitate to offend our friends in
Europe and Asia and to provoke the
Soviet and the Red Chinese. But if
the United States Navy no longer has
a mission to control the sea lanes, we
have been wasting billions of dollars
on an anachronism.

There have been no precedents
for pacific blockade in recent years.
We did not use this power in the Korean
War, despite considerable military
sentiment for it. But precedents
are created to meet emergencies.

To repeat: United States naval
power makes freedom of the seas
possible. During periods of belligerence,
that freedom is subject to control.
The bloody Ho Chi Minh trail
is long and winding. It begins at sea.
