**PERSPECTIVE**

**The Trend in Louisiana**

**by Raymond Moley**

SHREVEPORT—The recent contest for the governorship of this state revealed trends which are proof of the emergence of a two-party system:

1—It was the first statewide election in the United States since the accession of Lyndon B. Johnson to the Presidency. The surprisingly large Republican vote—more than 300,000, or 40 per cent of the total—may well indicate that the resentment of the South toward the liberal policies of the Democratic Administration in Washington has not greatly lessened with the change of Presidents. This result in Louisiana is especially notable since the state’s interests are closely tied with those of the President’s state of Texas.

2—The Republican candidate, Charlton H. Lyons, is a highly respected, dedicated businessman from Shreveport. His home area and most urban areas in the state gave him considerable majorities. His candidacy offered to a long-suffering state an alternative to miserable government at Baton Rouge. His opponent, John J. McKeithen, is a ranting demagogue—a pale carbon copy of the two Longs, Huey and Earl. With tiresome regularity since the days of the Civil War, contests for the governorship have been decided between rival Democrats in the primaries. The result has been a long succession of governors who have been either Longs, stooges of the Longs, other demagogues, or clowns like the present incumbent, Jimmie (“You Are My Sunshine”) Davis.

3—As the contest went on, McKeithen’s appeal to race prejudice became more and more shrill. Lyons supported segregation but beyond that he did not bring racial matters into his campaign speeches and literature.

4—In Caddo Parish (Shreveport) two Republican members of the legislature were elected. They defeated two long-entrenched Democratic representatives. These two new members assured me that they will be very vocal when proceedings begin in May. This means that plenty of light will be thrown upon state affairs—a light that has been sadly missing in the past. Lyons is establishing a Republican office in Baton Rouge to assist in the drive for better government and for the building of party strength for future elections.

5—Lyons has been a leader in the movement for Goldwater. The evidence shows that Senator Goldwater is still a favorite in the South.

6—The vote in the election and the polls beforehand showed a strong trend toward Republicanism among young people. A poll of students in Louisiana State University gave Lyons 1,600 and McKeithen 200. Similar results were shown in other academic institutions.

7—The strong Republican vote in some of the state’s Congressional districts indicates that before many elections have passed Louisiana will be sending Republicans to the House of Representatives in Washington. Lyons gained three wards in Hale Boggs’ district in New Orleans.

8—The voting pattern as well as other pieces of evidence reveals New Orleans to be, as one citizen told me, “an island in the sun” so far as race relations are concerned. There is no Negro voting problem in New Orleans. Lyons got a fair share of the votes of those Negroes who went to the polls this time. Measurable school integration in New Orleans is a fact. There is also some access to public accommodations. And there have been few, if any, demonstrations in the state in recent months.

In general, these conclusions are confirmed by a longtime friend of mine, Scott Wilson, a skillful and experienced political manager and observer. Wilson managed three of deLesseps Morrison’s campaigns for mayor of New Orleans and was close to the scene during the recent primaries and election.

Better state governments in the South can come only with the emergence of a vital two-party system. Economic growth and the demands of a younger generation assure this. Lyons and the two candidates for the legislature told me that the most popular appeal in their campaigns was their demand that voters must no longer be “taken for granted” by Democrats. It will take most skillful image-making this year to reveal LBJ in the North as the harbinger of a Brave New World while in the South he upholds the old, obsolete shell of Democratic absolutism.
