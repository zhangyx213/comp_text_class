**Who Helps Ike?**

**by Raymond Moley**

IN THE past two weeks I offered in this space an analysis of Senate and House votes on what I called "divided issues" during the 83rd Congress and the first session of the 84th. It shows fairly solid support of Republican leadership on major issues in which Republican leadership was arrayed against Democratic leadership. Since the President has asserted that he regards support of Republican leadership essential to the success of his policies, the undeniable inference is that the President needs a Republican Congress. The further undeniable inference is that, since Democratic membership was heavily arrayed against him on the "divided issues," he has little obligation to Democratic members.

This is a truly healthy manifestation of party government. But there are those who would have you believe that the President's party support is unreliable and that without Democrats he would be in a bad way.

Plenty of ammunition for this deceptive contention can be found in what is known as the Congressional Quarterly, a private commercial information service widely used by newspapers and magazines.

**VICTORIES?**

On Aug. 26, 1955, the C.Q. published a record of roll-call votes which it used to measure the support given the President in 1955. It showed 44 Eisenhower "victories" in the Senate, and in those "victories" Democrats supplied the margin of victory no less than 39 times. The method used to convey this highly debatable conclusion, however, was a curious selection of issues. For example, on eight of the issues there was actually no opposition whatever. On nineteen of the remaining issues there were less than twenty votes in opposition to the President's program. Moreover, the C.Q. used the amazing method of attributing to a marginal majority credit for the passage of measures which lacked a party majority. As the C.Q. put it:

"The President . . . owes his victories to Democratic support . . . even if 90 per cent of the Democrats voted against him; the other 10 per cent made his victory possible."

This is like saying that Ireland ruled England for a century or more, since the Irish generally had the marginal votes in the House of Commons.  The C.Q.'s analysis of House votes followed the same general pattern as its analysis of the Senate.

Very important issues were omitted on which the parties were squarely opposed to each other: For example, in the Senate analysis vital amendments to the farm bill, defense appropriations, the Mutual Security program, the extension of the Defense Production Act, the highway bill, the extension of the Trade Agreements Act, and the disposal of the government's rubber plants. In the House, omitted issues included important amendments to the farm and appropriation bills, Alaskan and Hawaiian statehood, tax reduction, disposal of rubber plants, and important economic investigations.

**FATAL BIAS**

The exclusion of such important matters of policy and the inclusion of meaningless votes on which there was little or no opposition created a fatal bias in the C.Q.'s analysis.

To show the effect of this, let us note an article based on the C.Q. analysis, published in *The Detroit News* shortly after the analysis was issued. Senator McNamara was shown as supporting the President 56 per cent of the time, and Senator Potter only 67 per cent. Seven Michigan Democratic congressmen, according to the article, supported the President an average of 55 per cent.

I wish at this point to repeat that the method which I used in the two analyses of roll-call votes to which I refer above is an accurate and irrefutable way of measuring support of the President and his party's leadership in Congressâ€”i.e., considering only those roll calls on which the leaderships were in opposition one to the other. On that basis Senator McNamara supported the President's party only 8.3 per cent, one Democratic congressman 4.2 per cent, and the other six Democratic congressmen zero per cent.

If Mr. Eisenhower is elected, it will be important to give him a cooperative Republican Congress.
