**Clark Equipment moves mountains**

...of building materials

Working as a team, these two Clark machines move mountains of materials from this New Hampshire building supply yard. The lift-truck (on the right) removes unit loads of lumber from the high stacks and sets them on the ground. Then the Ross Carrier® picks up the load and speeds it direct to the building site. No waste of time or manpower when Clark moves materials!


...or cuts construction costs

More Clark teamwork—this time in Michigan on the construction of a new factory. The versatile MICHIGAN® Tractor Shovel transports 2-ton trusses from a nearby rail siding to the erection site. In the background a MICHIGAN crane is swinging around to receive the truss and set it in place. Singly or in teams, Clark machines move materials at the lowest possible cost to their users.
