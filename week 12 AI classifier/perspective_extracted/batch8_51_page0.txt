**Perspective**

**Three Governorships**

by RAYMOND MOLEY

As we come to mid-October, two
political conclusions are clear. One is a
drift toward Republican candidates;
the other is a prospective small vote.
These two signs may or may not have
something in common. My impression
is that they are not related. The small
vote will come from many contributing
causes. First, a lot of people are in the
Army and Navy. Second, a lot more
are too busy to think about politics.
An election is a sort of little war, and
many vote merely to participate in a
contest. Now a real war captures the
spirit of contention in people.

A great many people have moved
because of their employment, and while
a lot of these still have the technical
qualifications for voting, they are in
strange surroundings and the normal
political pressures on them are gone.
Many thousands have moved from
rural districts to cities and know little
of urban registration rules.

These perfectly clear causes, with a
number of additional ones, will account
for a light vote. It is unnecessary to
characterize it as apathy.

The Republican drift is unmistakable
(see Periscope Preview). Vast numbers
of people are dissatisfied with the con-
duct of the war at home and abroad.
The rubber debacle alone will lose the
Administration countless votes. The
President's scolding of farmers has
made no new city and labor votes
but has lost him thousands in agri-
cultural regions. The New Deal has
led people to expect so much that they
tend to blame it for every discomfort.

In this off year, gubernatorial cam-
paigns are indicative of the trend.
Within the month I have made some
firsthand study in three widely sepa-
rated states—New York, Kansas and
California. In New York, a curious
mix-up in party 'behavior is evident
already. Bennett, who is a pretty un-
inspiring candidate despite the popu-
larity of his manager Farley, is stronger
in upstate Republican New York than
any candidate in years but weaker
in the big city. As things look now,
Dewey may come close to the un-
precedented feat of carrying the city
as a Republican. This creates an em-
barrassment of sorts for both Dewey
and Bennett. Dewey cannot attack the
Roosevelt Administration vigorously for
fear of losing the city. Bennett cannot

talk much about the President for fear
of losing support upstate. But Dewey
can afford to coast because, if the polls
are correct, nothing short of the com-
mission of homicide or arson could lose
him the election.

Kansas is interesting this year. The
Republicans had a spirited primary
contest. Senator Reed tried for the
Republican nomination for governor on
a crack-down-on-labor platform. He ran
third. Andrew Schoeppel, a clean-cut
and respected lawyer from a small city
in Western Kansas, won. He is opposed
by William Burke, who has held various
appointive offices from Washington and
who ran and lost in 1940. It looks like
an easy victory for Schoeppel.

There is real color in the California
fight. Olson was elected in 1938 by a
most indiscriminate collection of forces
—ham-and-eggers, labor, New Dealers,
Sinclairites, single taxers and socialists.
No one could satisfy such a motley
following, and Olson has had a riotous
time for four years. His opponent, Earl
Warren, now Attorney General, im-
presses those who know him as a man
of unique integrity and steadiness. He
was unopposed in the Republican pri-
mary, and in the Democratic primary
he ran Olson a rather close race.

The sole appeal of Olson is his
devotion to the President. He made hay
when the President visited California.
According to the announcement of the
Democratic Committee of Los Angeles,
Olson stuck to the distinguished visitor
like a burr in the mane of a lion. He
was in the automobile with the Presi-
dent as they toured the plants in Los
Angeles and San Diego and visited
naval and marine establishments. They
also visited an old mission. One cannot
help speculating upon the meditations
of the two as they contemplated the
venerable beauty of San Juan Capis-
trano. Surely their thoughts were far
from the political campaign. Perhaps
the President's visit has saved Olson,
but late reports still favor Warren.

The election of Warren and Dewey
in the two big states on opposite sides
of the country would be a considerable
return toward a political balance in
this country, especially since there
stretches between them an almost un-
broken string of states with Republican
governors now in office.
