**California Politics**

by Raymond Moley

LOS ANGELES—Since I commented in this space nearly two months ago on the political prospect in California, some things have been clarified. Others, however, are still in the realm of conjecture and may remain so for some time.

Both William F. Knowland and Goodwin J. Knight have announced their intention to enter the June primary as Republican candidate for governor. This in itself assures an exciting contest. Also, they are arrayed on opposite sides of one of the most critical and controversial issues before the American people. Knowland favors a state right-to-work measure. Knight is opposed. And in his opposition the governor is revealing his decision to cast his fate on the friends he has made among union leaders.

**STRONG LANGUAGE**

His language opposing the enactment of any such measure might have been phrased by those leaders themselves. In a very carefully calculated speech in September, Knight paid his respects to Knowland and to the right-to-work issue in strong language indeed. Knowland’s introduction of the issue was “unhappy and untoward.” Then Knight added: “...I had high hopes that the belligerence of those who selected labor as their political target would soften when they counted the cost of this divisive issue in terms of the state’s welfare, as opposed to their own ambition…The intelligent, fair-minded men and women of the Republican Party in California are not going to abdicate and permit the Grand Old Party to become an antilabor party. They are not going to permit any candidate, no matter how high his ambition, to read labor out of their party, and they are not going to lend themselves or the party machinery to a reckless campaign to destroy the union shop in California…No man with a reputation for belligerence, either in international affairs or domestic affairs…is a safe man for executive office in the Federal government today and he is equally unsafe to be entrusted with the governorship of California.”

Thus Knight describes the right-to-work issue as an effort to wreck labor and to destroy industrial peace, while he portrays Knowland as Brutus portrayed Caesar—the creation of ambition. The hint is that Knowland is seeking the Presidency over the recumbent body of Knight.

Friends of Knowland make it clear that when Knight talks of industrial peace he really means peace at the price fixed by certain labor leaders. Knowland has proposed a plan for what he describes as “union democracy.” The main provisions of his bill of particulars are that members of unions should be able to elect their officers, determine whether to strike or not, and call their leaders to account by secret and untrammeled voting. Also, that full protection and regulation should be required in the administration of welfare funds and other valuable rights of members. Knowland favors the legal protection of the right to work. He says that the right to work is next to the right to vote among the possessions of free men.

It is certain that a right-to-work measure will be on the ballot next November and that it will be phrased to meet the specifications of Knowland. The Democratic candidate will probably be Attorney General Edmund G. (Pat) Brown. He would be a formidable opponent for either Knight or Knowland, especially if the tide runs against Republicans in 1958.

**PLEASANT ALTERNATIVE**

The great handicap of Knight is that during his four years in office he has been busy winning friends among Democrats and members of unions. With the exception of about a third of the union members of the state who are Republicans, these friends cannot help Knight in a Republican primary. This obvious trap in which he has imprisoned himself makes chances of winning the primary decidedly dim. Friends of Knight are busy working on him to abandon the effort to seek the governorship and to run for the U.S. Senate. He would be a likely winner, and it would give him and Mrs. Knight six pleasant years in Washington. The Knights would enjoy that prospect. There is nothing of the crusader in Knight, and hence there would be no joy left for him as an ex-governor who fought and fell for the union shop.
