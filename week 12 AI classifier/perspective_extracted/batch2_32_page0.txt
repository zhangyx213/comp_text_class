**FEDERAL SCHOOL AID—II**

**BY RAYMOND MOLEY**

President Johnson's pursuit of what people are beginning to call a consensus in Federal aid to education faces very hard going. The complicated provisions in his plan to permit private and parochial schools to get some of the benefits—small though they seem to be when the fine print is examined—have already stirred serious opposition. Claims of unconstitutionality abound. Then there is opposition from the strict separationists among Protestants, Jews, and those of no faith at all. The Anti-Defamation League urges that "specific standards and safeguards" be written into the bill to make sure that no public-school child shall be exposed to "sectarian influence." Catholics, whose hopes were raised when Mr. Johnson proposed his omnibus program, now see their chance for aid vanishing.

It is clear that if the bill is passed in its present form it will be a divisive force throughout the land. Its provisions will be thrown open to endless litigation and possibly devastating judgments by the Supreme Court.

The President and Congress might well consider alternative means of aid to education. One such alternative approach is to provide the means by which the states, the school districts, and taxpayers may more easily pay for their own schools. This would be a means of allowing communities to raise some of the money which is now paid in Federal income taxes. Various versions of this have been proposed in the past.

**TAX CREDITS**

President Eisenhower proposed that the states should be permitted to collect a portion of excise taxes monopolized by the Federal government. Nothing came of this proposal. Rep. Frank Bow of Ohio suggested that 1 per cent of all individual and corporation income taxes be retained in the states for educational purposes. The Bow bill passed the House in 1961 by a voice vote but was later killed in a roll call.

Walter Heller, former Presidential adviser, proposed returning some Federal taxes to the states unconditionally. LBJ shelved this idea, but is said to be holding it for use when the economy needs a stimulant.

The concept of a tax credit to parents of college students has been around for a long time. Senator and former Secretary Ribicoff proposed this form of college aid, and his bill almost passed the Senate last year. He has introduced it again with 31 co-sponsors.

Rep. Thomas B. Curtis is drafting a bill which would provide such credits for elementary and secondary education as well as for college. Under the Curtis plan, a taxpayer would be allowed against his Federal income-tax payment a credit of a stated percentage, based on the taxes he pays to state and local governments for educational purposes. This would not exceed $100. The taxpayer would be allowed the credit whether or not he has children in school—public, private, or parochial. Or he could take a credit of $50 for each child he has in public or private school or college, the total not to exceed $200.

**BYPASS RELIGIOUS ISSUE**

Presumably, this would permit the state or school district to increase taxes for educational purposes and also permit religious institutions to increase their demands upon parents of children in their schools. The allocation of this taxpayers' windfall between public and private education would be left to the states, the districts, and the religious institutions. In short, the Federal government would wash its hands of the issue between public and private education.

Mr. Curtis says his bill, if passed, would "return a measure of taxing power to the local governing bodies which traditionally pay for and control education in this country." He says also that "it seems obvious to me that, if we pass this bill, we will have resolved the two otherwise insurmountable barriers to Federal aid to education: the fear of Federal control and the church-state issue."

There are certain advantages in this plan which make it preferable to a grant-in-aid program. It would provide the taxpayer with some additional capacity to pay for education. The question which would emerge, however, would be whether the states and school districts would or would not fully absorb the taxpayers' windfall.
