**The Critics of Congress**

by Raymond Moley

IN THE past months we have witnessed a great deal of criticism of Congress as an institution because of its failure to act upon the multitude of Presidential recommendations and requests which have been made this year and also in 1961 and 1962. Newspaper editorials, columns, books by professors, and a book by senators have echoed the theme. Congress must be reorganized, “streamlined,” so that it will promptly act when the President gives an order.

It is interesting to note that most of these people who would relegate Congress to a merely nominal role in our government also loudly denounce military or executive take-overs from representative governments abroad. Hence, while they denounce authoritarian governments abroad, they call for one here.

Much of the criticism of Congress centers upon the House, because that body has been less responsive to Presidents over the past few decades. In a scholarly and deeply penetrating book, “The Forge of Democracy” (496 pages. David McKay. $6.75), Neil MacNeil has pointed out that with a minimum of windy debate and a maximum of laborious committee work the House, at least in recent years, has more truly reflected the collective wisdom of the nation than has the Senate.

**PRESIDENT’S LOW SCORE**

MacNeil says that the Senate “has tended to be more sympathetic to the President… the House… has tended to be more parsimonious than the Senate with taxpayers’ money, more insistent on reducing the President’s requests for higher taxes and larger spending… less responsive to ‘bullet-vote’ activist pressure groups… That has made the House reflect, less than the Senate, labor unions, ethnic and urban minorities, and the liberal causes these groups have normally espoused.”

In the present Congress, however, the Senate as well as the House has been reluctant to subordinate itself to the President’s wishes. According to a compilation by the Congressional Quarterly covering the seven months prior to July 31, the President had sent 403 requests to Congress. Of these, only nineteen went in that period to the White House for the President’s signature. Thirty-eight had passed one house or the other. Five had passed both houses but awaited final Congressional action. Nothing at all had been done about 154. Fifteen had been rejected either by committee action or on the floor. Nineteen had been reported or approved by a committee but had not come up for a vote. One hundred and fifty-three had received committee attention but no approval. Thus the Presidential score was 5 per cent. To consider and act upon the 1963 Kennedy requests would take five years. But there are other reasons for the President’s low score.

**NO POPULAR DEMAND**

This is a Congress with overwhelming majorities of the President’s party. Republicans plus Southern Democrats could not alone have stopped this legislation. The failure to act has been because of the reluctance of members who expect to run in 1964 on a ticket headed by the President. They don’t want to go on record against him.

Early in 1961 the President and Speaker Rayburn “packed” the House Rules Committee after some of the most rugged and unscrupulous uses of pressure ever seen in Congress. But even after the enlargement of the committee, the gate was not opened. Members realized that without the restraint of the Rules Committee there would be chaos.

Why have all these requests withered on the vine? Because members realize that there is no popular demand for them. Not only are members closer to the American people —except on television—than the President, but a large number of them are better equipped to judge the wisdom and need of such legislation than is the Chief Executive. Moreover, a large number doubt the President’s sincerity in most of his proposals. They believe he is merely piling up a record to satisfy minorities upon which he must depend for re-election in 1964.

The worth of Congress cannot be judged only by what it passes. Equally important is what it rejects.
