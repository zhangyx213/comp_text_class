**PERSPECTIVE**

**U.S. Power Monopoly?**

by Raymond Moley

SECRETARY UDALL found in the
bureaucracy over which he presides a sizable number of holdovers from the regime of Secretary Ickes, indoctrinated with the idea that the Federal government should control if not own the means of production and transmission of electric power. New recruits in his department have been in sympathy with his public-power philosophy. The ultimate objective is a countrywide monopoly in that industry.

The Federal share in the production of electric power has grown from 1933—first, through the construction of large Federal dams and other generating facilities, and then through regional grids connecting these units. There was the Tennessee Valley Authority, then the Bonneville Power Administration, and a considerable series of installations in California, in the Missouri Valley, and in the Southwest. Then came the St. Lawrence project, jointly constructed by New York, the United States, and Canada; and later, the Upper Colorado project in the Mountain States.

The next step seems to be the joining of all these by Federal transmission lines. A plan of private companies in the Rocky Mountain area was forbidden, even before Udall came into office, by Secretary Seaton who comes from public-power Nebraska. Udall immediately proposed that the U.S. build those connecting lines. Recently Udall proposed that the U.S. build lines connecting the Northwest with the rich market in southern California.


**A NATIONAL GRID**

There are also many rural electric cooperatives all over the nation, subsidized by Federal loans at 2 per cent interest—money for which the Treasury must pay almost twice as much. Those cooperatives, originally designed to bring electricity to remote farms and towns, now seek to penetrate cities and their suburbs.

Ultimately, New Frontier plans contemplate joining all these sources of production, transmission, and distribution in one mighty nationwide grid. This monopolistic system could be used by private companies at a price and subject to Federal rules.


Over the years I have consistently refrained from calling the later New Deal, the Fair Deal, and the New Frontier species of socialism. This has been because socialism involves consistent planning absent from these programs of indiscriminate additions to Federal authority. But in these present plans of the Interior Department, a long-held basic objective of American socialism is plainly visible.

When Marxists attained power in Russia, Lenin noted that the Prophet had never given his disciples any plans to use in such an instance. Sidney Webb, the patron saint of British socialism, records in "Soviet Communism: A New Civilization?" that Lenin wrote in 1920 to Krzhizhanovsky:


**SOCIALIST FAILURE**

"Couldn't you produce a plan (not a technical but a political scheme) which would be understood by the proletariat? For instance, in ten years (or five?) we shall build twenty (or 30 or 50?) power stations covering the country with a network of such stations, each with a radius of operation of say 400 versts (or 200 if we are unable to achieve more)... We need such a plan at once to give the masses a shining, unimpeded prospect to work for: And in ten (or twenty?) years we shall electrify Russia, the whole of it, both industrial and agricultural. We shall work up to God knows how many kilowatts or units of horsepower."

I would not have introduced this note of comparison except that New Frontiersmen, including candidate Kennedy in 1960, have been telling us that Russia is going to overtake us in the production and distribution of electric power.

But in forty years since Lenin wrote, American individual enterprise not only has outstripped Russia but will be far ahead for at least twenty years to come. In 1960 the Soviet had only 62,000 miles of transmission lines. We have 304,000. Our production is 7,500 kilowatts per capita; the Soviet, 3,000. The average annual use per customer here is 3,927 kilowatt-hours; in Russia, 500. This advantage can be maintained if we avoid the temptation to nationalize a great industry owned by millions of American investors.
