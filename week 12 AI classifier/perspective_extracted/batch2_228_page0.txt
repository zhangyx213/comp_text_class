Perspective
Evangelist or Manager?
by Raymond Moley

IN A short time the Republican Na-
tional Committee will probably se-
lect a new chairman. Its decision
should reflect the capacity of the GOP
to cast aside a threadbare tradition.
For in the coming years it must
face two powerfully organized forces
loosely allied in the Democratic Party.
One of these is a Kennedy machine
directed by two and possibly three
brothers of that name, with many lo-
cal allies and enormous Federal pa-
tronage. The Kennedys and their
allies are resourceful, dedicated, po-
litical professionals who believe that
elections are won not by issues and
candidates alone, but mostly by or-
ganized power. The other force is
labor's Committee on Political Educa-
tion (COPE), also managed by full-
time professionals who have already
shown a formidable capacity to get
out their vote.
With a single exception, the Re-
publican Party in our time has been
chairmanned by part-time, unpaid in-
dividuals generally inexperienced in
grass-roots politics. They have con-
tributed what time they could spare
from their official or private duties to
evangelism, making stirring speeches
at party dinners and issuing state-
ments viewing with alarm or pointing
with pride. State and local chairmen
and committees, given these national
homilies on policy, were left to work
out their own problems.

MILLER AND BLISS
One man suggested for the chair-
manship is Congressman William E.
Miller of New York. Another, not an
active candidate, is Ray C. Bliss,
Ohio chairman.
Miller is an excellent individual, a
successful lawyer with a good record
in the House. He has stated that he
believes in an unpaid, part-time
chairmanship. He has apparently had
little or no experience in managing a
large political organization.
Bliss is an experienced, dedicated,
successful organization manager. He
carried Ohio in 1960 with the largest
majority cast in any state for the Re-
publican national ticket. The respect
with which he is regarded is shown by
his selection as head of the seventeen-
state Midwestern and Rocky Moun-
tain association of state chairmen. His
108

concept of the office of national chair-
man is that of a general manager, who
directs the headquarters staff and
gives instruction and assistance to
state and local organizations. He
would leave the evangelism to the
many willing party orators-senators,
congressmen, governors, and others.
He would favor no candidate for the
Presidential nomination, believing, as
did Will. Hays, that the job of the
chairman is "to elect, not select."
It is quite evident that in Washing-
ton there are several centers of ac-
tivity which claim to speak for the
party. Also, a small group of national
committeemen has been very influen-
tial in party affairs in Washington.
Miller is their man.

THE PARAMOUNT NEED
However, under the leadership of
state chairman Charles Thone of
Nebraska, there are being mobilized a
considerable number of Midwestern
and Rocky Mountain leaders who
want Bliss. And it is not without im-
portance to note that most of those
states went Republican in 1960.
There is where the major Republican
strength resides.
The old tradition of part-time, un-
paid national chairmen limits the
choice to those with another public
job or those with independent wealth.
But the conditions now prevailing and
the opposition that must be faced call
for a man who would be a real man-
ager, who can strengthen the head-
quarters staff, and whose help and
direction will be accepted by state
and local organizations. Such an indi-
vidual should speak the language of
those organizations and have suc-
cesses to his credit. The job of direct-
ing the activities of the Republican
Party is much greater now than it ever
was, because Republicanism is grow-
ing in the Southern States, and there
are Hawaii and Alaska to consider.
Better organization is the para-
mount need of the GOP. Poor organi-
zation lost the decisive states in 1960.
There is a vast Republican poten-
tial in the 34 million who voted for
Nixon-Lodge in 1960 and in the tens
of thousands of volunteers who helped
get out the vote. All this will fade
away unless the party is mobilized
for the long pull ahead.

the
calm beauty
of Japan
at almost
the speed of
sound

The calm beauty of Japan is all
around you on the DC-8C Jet Cour-
iers of Japan Air Lines. In the pattern
of a fabric, the texture of a carpet,
the cool symmetry of a shoji screen,
you get glimpses of the beauty of
Japan, an understanding of her vis-
ual discipline.
But the beauty of Japan is more
than visual. The Japanese idea of
service is a thing of beauty, too. And
while its perfection is the result of
intense discipline, you, as a traveler
on the Jet Couriers of Japan Air
Lines, will feel only its warmth and
graciousness. On no other airline
will you be looked after so well, by
kimono-clad hostesses whose real
desire is to serve... to make you
feel so relaxed and comfortable that
they can take just pride in your
happiness.
Enjoy this wonderful sense of well-
being as you fly high over the Pacific
on the DC-8C Jet Couriers of Japan
Air Lines. See your travel agent for
reservations from San Francisco, Los
Angeles and Seattle to Japan and
the Orient-and, soon, on from Tokyo
over the Pole to Europe. Fly amid
the calm beauty of Japan at almost
the speed of sound.
