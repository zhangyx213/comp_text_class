**PERSPECTIVE**

**The Image of Richard III**

**by Raymond Moley**

The long-subdued literary interests of Washington correspondents now find release in current copy. For the New Frontier has added patronage of the arts to the bulging wallet of Federal concerns. Hence, more than one commentator noted the President's mention of "the winter of our discontent." These words Shakespeare put into the mouth of Richard, Duke of Gloucester, later Richard III. So we skip taxes and Cuba and discourse on the tragedy of that hapless king.

There is vital information in that story for an Administration determined to hold authority for an indefinite period. There is the method by which Richard's successor enriched his revenues. There is also the value of having historians in official circles. For the scribblers who had the favor of Henry VII were immensely proficient in the art of image-making.

After his warriors, aided by deserters from Richard, finished the job of hacking away at the corpus of the king at Bosworth Field, Henry was duly crowned and rapidly earned the distinction of being the most acquisitive, not to say the most avaricious, of English kings. The extortions of his men Empson and Dudley were unpopular but productive. There was also one Thomas Morton, inventor of "Morton's Fork." Those who were living in what John K. Galbraith calls "affluence" were levied upon because, forsooth, they had it. Those who lived austerely were mulcted because they were presumed to have saved it. In terms of New Frontier economists, the first of these is called "channeling money into the public sector." The latter, a raid on savings, is inflation.

**SYMBOL OF EVIL**

Then there was the creation of what Paul M. Kendall, Richard's recent biographer, calls the "Tudor myth." This was: "Richard, the symbol of evil and discord, is eradicated by Henry Tudor, God's final agent of retribution and England's savior."

Henry employed John Rous, Robert Fabyan, and Bernard André. The last was Henry VII's poet laureate, historiographer royal, and tutor to Prince Arthur. Their writings were full of a sensational mythology concerning Richard as well as Henry. After Henry's death and 30 years after Bosworth Field, Sir Thomas More wrote his "History of King Richard III." More had little to guide him but what he was told by John Morton, Bishop of Ely, an infamous liar. There was also Polydore Vergil, a humanist and fabricator of history.

Thus the Tudor myth emerged. Richard was ill-featured, crook-backed, evil-eyed. He murdered freely. Also, Richard was carried by his mother two years and was born with a full set of teeth and long stringy locks.

**THE GATHERING DOUBTS**

Later still, in the second half of the sixteenth century, Edward Hall and Raphael Holinshed wrote their chronicles. They repeated the legend, and from them Shakespeare created his monstrous perversion of fact, "Richard III."

Later there were denials of the Tudor version. And a most important challenge was written still later by Horace Walpole, son of England's famous Prime Minister, Robert. This was published under the title, "Historic Doubts," in 1768.

Since then, it has been established that Richard was not appreciably deformed. He was a loyal supporter of his brother, Edward IV. He was an enlightened ruler. Richard's tragedy came because he sought to accelerate the breakup of the feudal system by enacting laws to safeguard the people against exploitation. Thus he earned the hatred of powerful nobles who repaid him by treacherously joining Henry.

Historical judgment has wavered concerning Richard's alleged responsibility for the disappearance of the two princes. Twice, certain bones have been exhumed and examined. The latest opinion is that even this evidence is inconclusive and that a more probable explanation is that the princes were taken to France. All this has been debated in letters to the London Times within the month. But the Tudor myth is still alive. And Richard has had a bad press for nearly five centuries.
