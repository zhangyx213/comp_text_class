**Just One Dam After Another—II**

by RAYMOND MOLEY


THE Central Arizona Project, described in this space last week, touches the vital interests of every taxpayer in the United States. Three questions are at issue:

1—Is Arizona entitled to the Colorado River water required for the project?

A bitter dispute over this point has been going on for years between Arizona on one side and California and Nevada on the other. Everyone now admits that the question should be decided by the Supreme Court. Arizona claims that it can be so decided only if Congress authorizes the project. California says the issue can be brought to the court without committing Congress to the project.

The House committee held against Arizona on this contention and has bottled up the measure. Some senators voted for the project merely to get a Supreme Court decision, despite their doubts about other aspects of the enterprise.

2—If Arizona is entitled to the water, are the benefits to that state commensurate with the cost to the nation?

This calls for a judgment of what a given number of beneficiaries should receive from the taxpayers of all states. The estimated total cost of the project, including interest over a 75-year period of partial repayment, will be about $2,100,000,000. This, however, does not include the costs of other dams which will be required up the river to prevent the original dam from filling up with silt. Also, senators claim that the term of repayment will run to 90 years or more, and the total cost would be nearer $3,000,000,000. The direct beneficiaries of the water would be 6,000 farms in three counties. An Arizona senator says that 30,000 farmers would be indirectly benefited. A division of these figures into the smaller $2,100,000,000 estimate yields $350,000 and $70,000 respectively. Arizona people point out, however, that all the people of the state would benefit from the power generated and from the prosperity of the benefited farmers. I leave that point to the reader, who realizes the vast tax burden which he is already bearing. The reader can also make some calculations of the cost per acre. Directly benefited would be 226,000 acres; indirectly benefited, 725,000.

Opponents of the plan question the wisdom of developing new agricultural production at such a great cost while the government is also spending large sums to support the prices of agricultural products raised elsewhere. This project, as described by Arizona senators, is a “rescue” enterprise—the rescue of farmers who are dependent on water which is rapidly vanishing. Time was, say opponents, when farmers thus confronted with diminishing returns moved to greener fields.

3—Is the financing of this project a safe precedent for future great public improvements?

Senator Knowland seriously challenges the financing plans of the Bureau of Reclamation as they are applied to this project. The general law governing reclamation projects requires that beneficiaries of irrigation repay the costs within 50 years. Under the terms of this project, the costs will not be paid within a period between 75 and 100 years. The general law requires that power projects repay the Treasury their construction cost plus 3 per cent. In this project, it is provided that the interest component of power revenues be applied to irrigation capital cost. This was described by Senator Knowland as an effort “to use a single dollar to pay a dollar’s worth of interest and at the same time to pay a dollar’s worth of capital.” He called it “double-dealing financial sleight-of-hand.”

THESE financial aspects have been subject to grave doubt by agents of the government itself, including the Secretary of Agriculture. The danger in the plan of repayment is that in vast enterprises in other states, where people are also eager to get special benefits, such a precedent will become the custom. Since members of Congress will respond to pressures, the march will go on. Logrolling will prevail, as it probably has in this case, and spending will reach unbearable sums. This project needs reexamination before one dam leads to many others.
