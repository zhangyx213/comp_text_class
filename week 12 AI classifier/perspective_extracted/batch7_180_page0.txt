**Time For Statesmanship**

**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

THE crisis in the Southâ€”created by the
President's civil-rights message calls
for more than mutual recrimination and
retaliation. The President could hardly
have been more inept in the manner
and timing of raising this issue. But
there is a constructive way out, if cool
heads on both sides can prevail.

The acute phase of the trouble started
with the appointment in late 1946 of
the President's Committee on
Civil Rights. The crisis ap-
peared with the publication
of the committee's report in
late 1947. The President's
message last month sub-
stantially adopted the com-
mittee's recommendations.

No one can quarrel with
the humane objectives in-
volved. No decent person,
North or South, condones
lynching or favors injustice, brutality or
bigotry. Almost everyone wants more
qualified people to vote. And few will
deny the desirability of fair employ-
ment, better housing and sound medi-
cal care for all.

The committee was ex parte and the
report was ex parte. The committee was
largely composed of Northerners who
will be regarded in the South as un-
familiar with Southern problems. The
preconceptions of its members are ap-
parent on every one of the 178 pages
of the report.

The report shoots the works. Prac-
tically every controversial racial issue
which has rocked Congress in
twenty years is included. In
tone it is an unmitigated in-
dictment of the South. In ar-
rangement it is an affront,
because the very first of its
recommendations is for the
imposition of a Federal police
system penetrating into
every corner of the South. It
speaks again and again of our
sister states in insufferably
condescending terms. "It is a sound
policy to use the idealism and prestige
of our whole people to check the way-
ward tendencies of a part of them."
The report recommends the withholding
of Federal grants in aid to force sov-
ereign and taxpaying states to obey.

It only grudgingly admits gains, al-
though gains have been significant.
Lynching has, in fact, almost disap-
peared. The figures are 64 in 1921;
three in 1939, and less than six annu-
ally since then. The poll tax and the
white primary have been disappearing
rapidly.

The committee and the President
seem to have forgotten that the
South's problem is not a pure question
of logic and law. It involves a sense of
bitter history and of personal and sec-
tional pride. A good illustration of the
ineptitude of the committee is its ap-
parent approval of the civil-rights legis-
lation passed between 1866 and 1875.
This program, as every reader of his-
tory knows, was the creation of a radical
Republican Congress inflamed by post-
bellum passion. It was designed to
humiliate and degrade a defeated en-
emy. It was a measure of Carthaginian
peace. No broad-minded Northerners
should want to recall that program or
the sordid atmosphere of those dreadful
years.

The constructive approach to this
problem is to invoke the principle of
regionalism. The President should have
used this principle a year ago, but it is
still not too late. He should call a con-
ference of all Southern governors, sena-
tors, congressmen and possibly college
presidents and other leaders. He should
then say that in the interest of na-
tional unity and of the demand of inter-
national efforts for equal rights, the
progress toward legal, political and eco-
nomic equality should be accelerated by
joint action. He should say, further,
that the Federal government will help,
not force, this effort. In short, the Pres-
ident would be well advised to lay this
problem in the hands of the enlightened
leaders of the South.

The timing of the report and message
could hardly have been worse. The
President is left open to the suspicion
that he has yielded to those who advise
him that at all costs he must win the
political support of Northern cities and
that the South has no option except to
vote for him. Thus, a blinding political
fog is thrown over a grave issue of
broad national welfare. The whole af-
fair cannot but handicap the enlight-
ened leaders in the South and add
power to demagogues and clowns.

THE most persistent of traditions can
be unmade. But traditions cannot
be changed by threats or outside
pressure.
