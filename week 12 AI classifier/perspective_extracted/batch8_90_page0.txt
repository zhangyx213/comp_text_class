**Perspective**

**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

**Churchill**

With nations at war it has for centuries been the rule that a great voice is worth many legions in the field. It is no news to Americans that in Winston Churchill the British have such a voice. But the climax of the Prime Minister's visit here—his address to the Congress of the United States—was a matchless expression of the resolution, the hopes and the singleness of purpose of many nations. The words were worthy of the occasion and its necessities.

Great as was the utterance, the silent fact behind it was even more important. That fact was the fiber of the man who spoke. Back through many years to the public career of a father who quit high office and party for his convictions, Winston Churchill's marks of distinction have been his courage and independence. In the ups and downs of public life he has tasted the bitter with the sweet. And it was no surprise to those who knew the stuff of which he was made that in the black summer of 1940 his "Olympian fortitude" sustained and quickened those among whom hope was all but lost.

Last week Churchill gave us the kind of warning that Americans will always take from a man who has himself triumphantly survived disaster. We shall have plenty of reverses, he told us, before our real superiority shows itself. For this stiff dose of realism the people of America will bless Winston Churchill, now and always.


**The Psychology of Attack**

Those who wondered what the spirit of our civilian population would be at the first impact of war's reality might well consider California's state of mind after three weeks of war. Consider, for instance, the small city of Santa Barbara, in which these observations are being written.

Santa Barbara, with the mountains at its back, looks out over the Pacific. A little over a week ago, its morning paper, *The News Press*, carried two front-page stories side by side. The first told of a submarine attack on the tanker *Storey* within sight of the shore and less than 50 miles from the city. The second announced a drive to make Santa Barbara "No. 1 Thumbs Up City in the United States." All articulate civic organizations, it said, urged that those directing the military strategy of the nation be told that the war need not be fought on the principle of defense so far


as the nerves and property and lives of the Coast cities are concerned. The Coast cities can take it. They can take it just as Santa Barbara fifteen years ago took an earthquake, relatively more devastating than the bombings London took from Hitler, and still rose from the ruins.

The cities of California are pretty impatient with Mr. La Guardia's administration of the Office of Civilian Defense, of course. Pointedly *The San Francisco Chronicle* comments on the need for efficient organization rather than "spread eagle speeches." Up and down the Coast the remark is made that Mr. La Guardia should concentrate on his big job in New York and let "some practical man" head the OCD. The excellent home defense developing everywhere in California is almost solely the result of home efforts.

Meanwhile, the people of the state are resentful of friends and relatives elsewhere who write offering them shelter and refuge. "Refuge?" they ask indignantly. "Why, the people of this state want the country to know that California is maintaining the normal course of its life and determined to maintain it, with such regard to wartime necessities as is required the country over. Now, as always, California is a great place to live, do business, educate children and spend a holiday. Heaven knows, we don't need any odds." And this observer certainly confirms it.

Here, if anywhere, it is clear that the country seconds James Conant's statement that it will be better for American cities to take token bombings in their stride than for the nation to withhold planes, guns and ammunition needed at Singapore and other outposts. Here, if anywhere, it is clear that Mr. Roosevelt, Mr. Churchill and all those who make decisions for us can be assured of one momentous fact: the American people are fully prepared to sacrifice small securities to achieve the greater security of winning the war wherever it must be fought. They want competence and intelligence in organization. But they will not flinch at discomfort or danger in their own daily living.


**Living With Censorship**

Living with censorship isn't going to be pleasant. But there are lots of things we would like even less. A reign of rumor, for example. It is bad enough to stand up

against the hot gusts of irresponsible talk that pass from person to person. But to permit wide and apparently authoritative dissemination of even a fraction of this gabbling would be ruinous to our military effectiveness and our morale as well. Intelligent censorship is not only a way of protecting us from a foreign enemy and preventing him from obtaining information of military value. It is a way of saving us from ourselves.

All of us bear witness to our own terrific appetite for news. We consume hours of radio news. We read vast quantities of printed material. This is inevitable, since we are fully aware of our stake in the world conflict. It is also desirable—desirable because an informed, alert and intelligent public opinion is one of the most potent advantages that we have in the balance against the Axis. For years the peoples under Axis domination have been groping in the dark. Their faculties for seeing, understanding, believing, are in large part atrophied. Informed opinion is our ultimate security. It is the guarantor of the full exercise of our striking power.

So far as the practical aspects of censorship are concerned, we in the United States have great advantages. We can profit by the mistakes of Great Britain, where many faltering steps finally resulted in a workable system. We start at the point Britain reached after two years of experiment. And we start auspiciously—with a governmental organization that appears to conform with sound principles of wartime censorship; with a real newspaperman, Byron Price, as its director; with a general disposition on the part of press and public to bear with the censor. There will be squabblings, mistakes and complaints. On their side, the newspapermen will be working in most difficult circumstances, compelled to go without or hold back news that all their instincts and professional training impel them to get and publish. But barring strong evidence to the contrary, there is no reason to assume that the censor will be unfair or unreasonable or that he will permit the antagonism against the press characteristic of a few officials to influence the flow of news.

It has been made clear that, as in England, editorial opinion will not be a subject of censorship. Under such a policy there will occasionally be unmerited criticism. But the maintenance of criticism in Congress and in the press is insurance that those responsible for the war effort not only want to do their best, but want to be told when they do not seem to be doing their best. The public can be trusted to reject captious critics, and those who write criticism can be trusted to keep this fact in mind. For writers of opinion in the last analysis depend upon the good will of the public. They can have no influence without it.
