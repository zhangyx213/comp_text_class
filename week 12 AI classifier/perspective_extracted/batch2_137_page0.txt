**The Faith of the FBI**

by Raymond Moley

A J. Edgar Hoover is completing
four decades of service as chief
of the Federal Bureau of Investiga-
tion, it might be suggested that the
letters FBI could stand for fidelity,
bravery, and intelligence. For scores
of FBI men in fierce and sometimes
bloody encounters have shown rare
courage. And on other occasions the
fine intelligence of Hoover's men has
outwitted and frustrated the sharpest
crooks in the underworld and the
elite among alien subversives.

But what most distinguishes the
career of J. Edgar Hoover is his
fidelity to the limited function of his
organization and to constitutional re-
strictions. Americans should remind
themselves from time to time that
the FBI is largely an investigative
agency. It does not prosecute. It does
not judge. It finds the facts and sub-
mits them to agencies responsible for
doing something about them. The
FBI lets facts speak for themselves.

This concentration of function has
marked J. Edgar Hoover as more
than a super detective, more than an
uncommonly capable executive, more
than a protector of American security
against alien enemies. He has the
essential qualities of a statesman. For
true statesmanship is found in an in-
dividual who when in power under-
stands the limitations within which
that power should be prudently
used. He can live with power with-
out succumbing to its narcotic effect.

**NO POLITICS**

In a government where the expan-
sion of authority and the growth of
the establishment are the rule, the
FBI has provided a luminous ex-
ception. Its size has grown to 16,000
employees, but every addition has
been made in response to Congres-
sional action on urgent problems.

On many occasions Hoover has
been asked to step beyond the limits
of his assigned duties and literally
take over functions of a state or
county prosecutor or police force.
Often this demand has been accom-
panied by great political pressure.
Unusual integrity and discretion have
resisted such pressure.

Serving under his sixth President,
Hoover has survived twelve Attorneys
General. In 1933, when party con-
trol in the executive department
changed, the political nabobs around
Roosevelt demanded his job for this
or that ambitious police chief of their
ilk. Attorney General Cummings
asked for time, and after a month
demanded and received Presidential
authorization to keep Hoover where
he had been and where he is now.

**LIBERTY PROTECTED**

After the sad days of the Depart-
ment of Justice under Harry Daugh-
erty, Harlan F. Stone was appointed
Attorney General in 1924. The bu-
reau in which Hoover was a young
subordinate was ridden with politics
and encumbered with bureaucratic
hacks. Stone offered Hoover the job
of rehabilitation. Hoover made a con-
dition of his acceptance that the bu-
reau should be completely divorced
from politics, that he should be
responsible only to the Attorney
General, that appointments should re-
quire high standards of merit, and
that promotions should be deter-
mined only on proven ability.

Stone, never a demonstrative man,
said coldly that he would have made
the offer only with that in mind.
"That's all. Good day."

Hoover transformed the bureau
into a "tight ship." He emphasized
quality rather than quantity in em-
ploying operatives. New procedures
were introduced. Fresh methods of
operation were determined. Scientific
methods built up over the years have
had incredible usefulness.

As long as Hoover or the Hoover
tradition is on guard, Americans need
not fear the perils of a police state.
He has said: "The secret of crime
eradication lies not in a national po-
lice force but in solidarity and the
linking of all law-enforcement agen-
cies." He has gained that solidar-
ity, better called cooperation, by
never usurping but in helping local,
state, and other Federal authorities
through mutual respect and trust.

Finally, he and his extraordinary
staff have indefatigably guarded the
liberties of Americans against the hot
blood of overzealous pursuers of al-
leged wrongdoing. He has kept in
mind the old rule that not only must
there be guardians, but that some-
one must guard the guardians.
