**The Coming Battle of Ohio**

by RAYMOND MOLEY


IN recent visits to Cincinnati and
Cleveland I have found that voters
of Ohio are once more anticipating
their return to the high firmament of
national politics. The year will be
1950; and the issue, the reelection of
Sen. Robert A. Taft. Discussion out
there is centering on the identity of
Taft’s opponent, the nature of the
campaign, and the question of out-
side help for both sides.

For a time it was be-
lieved that Taft’s opponent
would be the Democratic
governor, Frank Lausche.
In sheer popularity Lausche
ranks exceedingly high. He
would be hard to beat for
any office. I learned, how-
ever, from people who
know Lausche and have
seen him recently that the
governor is likely to by-pass the sen-
atorship and run again for his pres-
ent office.

Lausche likes his job. He enjoys
executive work and is well aware of
the exacting study that would be re-
quired to prepare himself for a ter-
rific campaign on national issues
against a man like Taft. Moreover, it
is not at all unlikely that Lausche, if
reelected governor, will be a natural
choice for a place on the national
ticket in 1952. He is a Catholic and
would have some difficulty in getting
the nomination for President. But
there would be strong political ad-
vantages in his running as a candi-
date for Vice President.


More important in this speculation
is the fact that Lausche is prob-
ably no more pro-labor than is Taft.
He has a refreshing independence of
mind. Certainly, he would never want
to appear as a stooge either for the
high command of labor or for the
Truman Administration. If he spoke
his mind on labor legislation, the
whole issue of opposition to Taft
might evaporate.

If Lausche decides to run for gov-
ernor, the hunt for a Taft opponent
will be difficult. The selection would
be made in a primary among several
candidates much less known than Taft
or Lausche. There would probably be
a congressman or two, the mayor of
Cleveland, and others. There would
emerge no Democratic candidate who
would be suitable as the champion of
national labor leaders. Thus the op-
position to Taft starts with a serious
handicap.

The form of the Ohio ballot pre-
sents a disadvantage for Taft. The
ballot is headed by the candidates for
governor; the names of Senatorial
candidates appear below those for all
state offices. With Lausche up there
at the head of the Demo-
cratic column, a great many
votes would go to any
Democratic opponent of
Taft. It has been suggested
that Bricker, always a sure
winner in Ohio, run once
more for governor. Some
color is lent to this idea be-
cause Bricker seems not
especially happy as senator.
Like Lausche, he is a nat-
ural executive. Bricker, however, is
likely to spurn the suggestion that he
run for governor again.

Whoever Taft’s opponent may be,
he will be the favorite of national
labor leadership. Messrs. Green and
Murray have made a pretentious chal-
lenge. The letter written by Green to
Majority Leader Lucas in his disap-
pointment after Taft’s victory on the
injunction issue surely justified Taft’s
characterization as “the most pre-
sumptuous statement that any indi-
vidual has ever made to the Senate
of the United States.”

Consider what would be said if the
president of the NAM had practically
demanded a specific Senate vote on a
specific measure at a specific time!
The Green letter may be an effective
piece of Republican propaganda in
next year’s showdown in Ohio.


Taft is emerging in this labor fight
as the authentic leader of the Re-
publican Party. Whether he should
or will be the candidate for President
in 1952 is irrelevant. The point is that
Taft has made an issue which the
great majority of his Republican col-
leagues have supported. It is the best
issue the Republicans have had in
years. It is whether labor leadership
is to deny the President the power, in a
case in which he considers the national
health and safety to be imperiled, to
appoint a board to make a report and,
if the dispute continues, to get a 60-
day injunction from the courts.
