To Mr. Sit-by-the-Fire

by Raymond Moley

IF THE Republican Party wins this
one, it will be in spite of what some
Republicans have done. The alleged
issues of the opposition presented by
orators from Truman and Stevenson
down are frivolous, shopworn, and
irrelevant. But there is every evi-
dence that over the country millions of
real and potential Republicans are
going to sit this one out. These I
would classify as the dis-
contented and the apa-
thetic. There is a difference.

Nothing can be gained by
failing to specify the reasons
why so many regular Re-
publicans are unhappy. I
have heard about it in
every state I have visited,
especially in California, Illi-
nois, Ohio, and New York.
Reliable reports from other
states show the same symptoms.
Republican regulars believe that
White House official advisers and
such unofficial busybodies-without-
portfolio as Paul Hoffman and Brother
Milton have used their influence to
keep in office holdovers from the New
and Fair Deals, and as a consequence
have perpetuated policies repudiated
in 1952 and have cut off the faithful
from rewards in the form of jobs. They
believe, moreover, that the aforemen-
tioned advisers are responsible for the
adoption of a soft policy toward the
sins and sinners of the past Democratic
regime and the suppression of further
attacks such as that made by the At-
torney General on the Administration
that harbored Harry Dexter White
and others. They have also noted the
tendency of people around the Presi-
dent to regard politics as a dirty game
and to exalt the President as a being
above and detached from the party
that elected him. At the moment they
are wondering why the President has
been so inactive in this campaign. In
Illinois, regulars believe that the "Pal-
ace Guard" wants Meek to be de-
feated. In New York and New Jersey
they resent the presence of Javits and
Case on Republican tickets.

There are a very great many people
who are intensely resentful because
they believe that the "Palace Guard"
is responsible for the attacks which
have immobilized McCarthy in this
campaign. I heard one person say:
"They haven't got to Lattimore yet,
but they have tried McCarthy three
times." In certain parts of Massachu-
setts, New York City, and the Middle
West, this feeling is strong enough
to be decisive.

These discontented people believe,
after all, that the President is not a.
very good Republican, and so their
inclination is to stay home.
There is apathy as well as discon-
tent-apathy inspired not
because those afflicted are
unhappy about President
Eisenhower, but because
they are too happy. These
are the self-anointed "inde-
pendents" who voted for
him but will not vote for
his party. They believe that,
having elected him, all will
be well, that he will do
quite well with any sort of
Congress, that the Republican Party is
a pretty messy affair, and that a de-
feat for Republican members of Con-
gress will be wholesome. Perhaps,
they rationalize, the party should be
purged of all its conservatives.

Both of these groups, the discon-
tented and the apathetic, should real-
ize that by refusing to vote they are
helping the very people whom they
opposed in 1952. The discontented,
by such a course, will accomplish
nothing but the defeat of a lot of con-
gressmen and senators who are, se-
cretly at least, just as resentful of the
influence of the "Palace Guard" as
they are. They are helping to elect a
Congress which may permit the ulti-
mate return of the very conditions
which they opposed over the many
years before 1952. And the apathetic
"independents" are leaving the Presi-
dent in a position where a hostile Con-
gress will do everything it can to
discredit his Administration. For Dem-
ocrats are in business not to help the
President but to destroy him.

TO BOTH groups I would suggest that
in a system of free elections and
free government it is mean, selfish,
and reprehensible for a person to take
the position that if he cannot have ex-
actly what he wants he will not vote at
all. I wish it were possible perma-
nently to disfranchise those who fol-
low that course. They are worse than
useless. They are disloyal to the very
essentials of free institutions.
