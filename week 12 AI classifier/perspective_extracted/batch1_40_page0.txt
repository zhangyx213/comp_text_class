**THE COLD WET WAR**

**BY RAYMOND MOLEY**

The rising challenge of Soviet sea power is now perhaps the central point in a revision of cold-war strategy. After the death of Stalin it seems to have become evident to Khrushchev and other shrewd leaders of the Kremlin that to overrun Europe with the immense Red Army —or even to paralyze Western Europe through the promotion of Communist parties there—would be self-defeating. This would be true even if it could be conceived that the United States were kept out of the conflict and nuclear war avoided. For in either case, by invasion or by subversion in Western Europe, the Soviet Union would be economically isolated and its own development frustrated for years to come.

In any event, Russian economic development would be slow because of the great distances between raw materials and Soviet industrial centers. Transportation within the great land mass would be difficult. The need for food became more and more imperative as agricultural plans lagged. It was also necessary to buy machinery and equipment. Consequently, the Soviet Union began to encourage commerce with the highly industrialized nations of Western Europe and more recently with Japan. The ironical part of this is that these countries have recovered very largely because of American help.

**THE NEW SOVIET NAVY**

In this move toward more mutually advantageous trade relations, the old dream of ideological conquest was not forgotten, nor was the calculated plan to embarrass the United States and drain its resources. This is carried on in part by subversion coupled with incitement of disturbances, mostly in the new and developing nations, and also by pressure near or at the great narrow channels of sea transportation. On a world scale the Soviet moved to break out of its land isolation, and this could only be accomplished by exploitation of the high seas.

The Soviet Navy had its origin in 1928 as a part of Stalin’s various plans. It is now second to that of the United States. According to the 1965-66 edition of "Jane's Fighting Ships," the Soviet has 22 cruisers, 150 destroyers, 35 nuclear-powered submarines, 390 conventionally powered submarines, 100 frigates, 700 mine sweepers, 250 escort and patrol vessels, 350 motor torpedo boats, 550 motor gunboats, 130 landing craft, 300 auxiliaries and 200 service craft. It does not now have any aircraft carriers. This navy is relatively small in comparison with that of the United States, but it is very modern.

**MERCHANT MARINE PRIORITY**

Much more important than the Soviet Navy is the great expansion of the Russian merchant marine. A five-year plan was launched in 1956 to build 5 million tons of shipping by 1960. And in 1960 a twenty-year plan was inaugurated. This tremendous building program was carried on in the shipyards of no less than ten nations. According to Jane’s, the Soviet had 1,000 merchant ships ten years ago. It now has in service 1,700, aggregating 7 million gross tons. In May 1966 the Soviet had under construction or on order 581 ships totaling just under 6 million d.w. tons. When sea power is calculated, this Soviet merchant fleet must be reckoned as a naval auxiliary. Most of their ships are designed to be readily convertible for war purposes.

In the United States the current budget for shipyard subsidy allows for the construction of only thirteen dry-cargo ships, although 70 per cent of American shipping is obsolete. The war in Vietnam has already called for a large proportion of the usable remainders in the reserve fleet. Without firm Executive action, we are heading for a national disaster.

We have only to recall the Cuban missile episode to realize that Soviet merchant ships are well designed, well built and extremely efficient in operation. Moreover, in addition to shipyards Russia has built excellent port facilities. There is expert management, and seagoing personnel are highly trained. In this immense adventure the Russians seem to have unlimited money, plus the advantage of determined effort to which they have given highest priority.

With manifold commitments around the globe, we are faced with the most formidable rival in all our history. It has been building vital strength where we are vulnerable.
