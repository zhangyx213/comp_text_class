**PERSPECTIVE**

**ROCKEFELLER-REAGAN?**

**BY RAYMOND MOLEY**

A leading member of the Reagan-for-President hopefuls has explained his preference in terms of "maturity." Ronald Reagan, he said, is more mature and sophisticated than was Barry Goldwater in 1964. But he quickly added that his people would find both Nelson Rockefeller and George Romney "totally unacceptable."

The relative maturities of the various Republican Presidential possibilities is not the subject of this piece. But the maturity and sophistication of those who are promoting a Reagan boom are quite pertinent to any appraisal of current calculations in the GOP. Those conservatives who would plunge Reagan into the contest for the nomination are doing exactly what many veteran Rockefeller supporters hope for. Since that hope includes the defeat of Richard Nixon, it is believed that the outcome would be a Rockefeller-Reagan ticket. This, it is anticipated, would provide for them the best of two GOP worlds.

Five weeks ago, a highly sagacious Republican politician told me that as the cause of Romney fades out, Rockefeller strategists, in order to eliminate Nixon, will promote the fortunes of Reagan. Their purpose would be not the nomination of Reagan, but to give Rockefeller a chance to emerge as the Presidential candidate. And by adding Reagan to a Rockefeller ticket, to win support of enough conservative strength to win the election. In these calculations it is assumed that, regardless of what may happen in early primaries, the Republican convention will not nominate Romney.

**STRANGE BEDFELLOWS**

This seemed to be highly speculative, even improbable. But since then, certain bits of the complex puzzle have begun to fall into place. More than one of the people identifiably close to the Rockefeller organization has spoken openly of the attractiveness of a Rockefeller-Reagan ticket. The refrain has been echoed in various powerful media of communication in the East. And a poll showing Rockefeller-Reagan running even with Johnson-Humphrey has appeared.

A Vice Presidential nomination used to be regarded as a necessary but politically useless addition to a ticket. The Presidential candidate was for real. The Vice Presidential candidate was to lure the unwary. But John F. Kennedy's selection of Lyndon B. Johnson for second place is still believed to have assured the margin of victory. That is why liberal strategists believe Reagan to be indispensable to a Rockefeller candidacy.

Nothing much can be done about the young conservatives who are pasting Reagan-for-President stickers on their car bumpers. Boys will be boys. Their "movement," however, is not altogether innocent, for among them are certain elders who have always been hostile toward Nixon. Nor are the Easterners who are talking about a Rockefeller-Reagan ticket disingenuous. Both groups, worlds apart in their philosophies, are intent upon eliminating Nixon.

**THE DECISIVE KEYS**

There are two factors which are the keys to the ultimate decision. One is the mood of the prospective delegates who will answer to the roll call in 1968. For there will be a large majority of delegates from the Midwest, the West and the South. These made up the preponderant vote that nominated Goldwater in 1964. There is good evidence that they will absolutely refuse to nominate Rockefeller or Romney, regardless of what happens in the early primaries.

The other factor is Reagan himself. On the one hand, there are a few people close to him who are urging him to seek the Presidential nomination. He is ambitious. Who isn't? The aforementioned young conservatives look to him as the redeemer of the 1964 lost cause. His platform appearances ignite great enthusiasm. And audiences are a heady narcotic.

On the other hand, a great many of his 1966 supporters in California want him to continue in his job as governor. His equipment to campaign against LBJ, he must realize, is limited. To enter the New Hampshire primary would hurt Nixon and antagonize Nixon supporters. A contest with Nixon might well split the GOP once more. Reagan's own current disposition is to reject any movement for him in the New Hampshire primary and perhaps in Wisconsin. He has given assurance that he will positively refuse to take second place on a Rockefeller or Romney ticket. He says that oil and water don't mix. But if all others fail by convention time, who can refuse a party demand?

That is how it looks at this time, in September 1967.
