**Hoover—the Great Quaker**
by RAYMOND MOLEY

THE public's estimate of a notable
man rises and falls like a mariner's
barometer. But if the subject of this
changing judgment is a solid man, he
remains the same through the storms
of public opinion. Nothing has ever
shown this so well as the way of the
nation with Herbert Hoover.
Almost alone among the men
around Wilson, he emerged im-
mensely popular from the
first world war. The remark-
able fact was that his
achievement was not mili-
tary, but humanitarian and
economic. We know how
that popularity vanished in
the great depression, to a
point where he had to bear
alone the scorn and ridicule
of half a nation. Finally, in
the late afternoon of his life,
the mist and clouds have passed, and
he is seen again in warm public favor
as our foremost elder statesman.
Despite this fickle way of the public
with him, Hoover has remained fun-
damentally the same in his faith,
philosophy, methods, and purposes.
Those who know him well realize that
his moods have not been so stable. He
suffered and could not hide his suffer-
ing under attack. But he has been
happier of late. That is the reward
of a man who can endure, wait,
and believe.

MANY religious faiths have condi-
tioned men to the cruel vicissi-
tudes of public life. In the case of
Hoover it has been Quakerism. For
that reason, an interpretation of
Hoover on that background is not
only an explanation of the inward in-
tegrity of the man, but a revelation of
what a small but sturdy sect has
meant to the country in which it found
a full life. David Hinshaw, a Quaker
himself, has offered this in "Herbert
Hoover, American Quaker."* Hinshaw
is one of the best-known of the little-
known public men in America. He has
been a friend of Hoover for 35 years.
Forty years ago, he was a worker in
T.R.'s Progressivism. Since then, he
has lent his enthusiasms and intelli-
gence to sound political action as well
as to progressive business.
In this book he has found the indis-
pensable factor in distinguished biog-
raphy—a central theme or principle
around which the facts of history can
be aligned and which makes those
facts vital and intelligible.
The greatness as well as the inci-
dental shortcomings of Hoover the
public figure are delineated by
Hinshaw with Quaker bluntness and
sincerity. "It is undeniably true," he
writes, "that Quaker caution or pru-
dence frequently disturbs,
irritates, exasperates, or
causes 'some amusement
and gentle cynicism' on the
part of non-Quakers who
are in a hurry to make over
the world ... These influ-
ences do make Quakers dif-
ferent, and in some ways
not always to their credit,
from their fellow human
beings."
This demeanor often obscures from
us the fact that the Quaker is pro-
foundly a pioneer and an innovator.
The Quaker faith gave this country a
proportion of its great heritage far
beyond the relative number of its ad-
herents. It has taught, as Hoover has
himself expressed it, that in govern-
ment as in private life, morals include
"money and honesty ... telling the
whole truth ... keeping one's word
... fidelity to public trust."
It was this faith that probably led
Hoover in the desperate campaign of
1932 to tell the farmers of the country
to beware of the promise of economic
stability and salvation through govern-
ment. This declaration lost him hun-
dreds of thousands of votes—perhaps
the election. But its truth may yet be
vindicated. Hoover's faith had also
induced him to tell hard truths to
business. He failed to turn language to
those uses which evoke belief and
support from irreconcilable extremes.

HINSHAW'S most potent comment on
Hoover deserves quotation:
what motivated him was his un-
changed and unchangeable purpose
in preserving the middle-class Ameri-
can social, political, and economic
institutions... In all his essential char-
acteristics, Hoover was a middle-class
President who strove to perpetuate
middle-class ideals."
The country may yet find that
ultimate safety, as well as greatness,
may lie in those ideals.
