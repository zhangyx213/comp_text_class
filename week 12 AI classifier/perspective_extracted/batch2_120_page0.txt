**PERSPECTIVE**

**Irreparable Loss**

**by Raymond Moley**

THESE days, as officers of our armed
forces serve their routine duties—in
lonely bastions at the periphery of
the free world, or far above the
earth on reconnaissance flights, in a
submarine suspended beneath the
sea, on the bridge of a surface ship,
or behind a desk in Washington—
many are asking themselves whether
the career they chose in the flush of
young manhood will be worth a life’s
dedication. This is a grim factor in
what Washington jargon calls our
“defense posture.”

This unhappy climate which has
enveloped the military services during
the past 30 months is only partially
reflected in what high officers have
said of their frustrations at the hands
of Defense Secretary Robert S.
McNamara and his civilian subordinates.
Ties of sympathy run from top to
bottom in a military service. Those
who are young have served their
apprenticeship under those older men.
And they measure their own future in
terms of what happens in the final
years of the careers of those who have
gone before them. If blocks appear far
ahead in the path of opportunity,
younger officers will look for careers in
some other occupation. To be rebuked
for a failure is a matter which military
officers take in line of duty. To be
subjected to firm, even harsh, discipline
is a soldier’s or a sailor’s lot. But to be
ignored in decisions for which years of
training have prepared them is demoralizing.
In these men dedication is their virtue and
pride their reward.

**CLOUDY PROSPECT**

Those high officers who are in retirement
and are now free to speak have made it
very clear indeed that they regard the
McNamara regime as a grave threat to the
fine competence and spirit of the services to
which they have given their lives. They
hear promising officers questioning in
private the wisdom of continuing in the
Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps. A
growing number of officers of great promise
are “asking-for-out” before reaching the age
of compulsory retirement with its attendant
benefits. Unlike military men in older
civilizations, these men were born in the
American competitive society. They are
examining the promise of higher rank with its
responsibilities and prestige. They have found
those hitherto priceless values now hollow
and wanting.

In the past, the brilliant, hard-working,
ambitious officer might look to high rank and
commensurate authority and esteem. But now,
through a series of “reorganization” acts of
Congress, our foremost military figures are
smothered under an amorphous civilian
authority. Their advice is not sought, except
as a matter of meaningless formality. Their
counsel and their warnings are ignored. And
their customary functions are usurped by what
Gen. Thomas D. White has called a
“tree-full-of-owls type” of so-called “defense
intellectual.” The term “defense intellectual”
conveys a nice, cozy, unwarlike, and
non-military feeling, as though modern war
could be settled on a chessboard in an
ivy-covered hall.

**EFFECT ON MORALE**

But by law the Joint Chiefs are the military
advisers to the President. The Secretary of
Defense is charged by Congress to
“coordinate.” But he now “directs” and
“controls.”

What are the subordinates of these rejected
chiefs to think? While an indeterminate
number of officers in service are seeking
another career, the discontent goes deeper. At
the academies and colleges, cadets and
midshipmen are wondering whether it is not
better to forgo the long road to the top. “Why
not change to MIT and then to a research
corporation and at 27 find myself overruling the
generals and admirals?”

Corporations and universities are receiving
more and more applications from officers who
want to get out. Figures will soon be available
which will measure this loss by resignations and
early retirements. But the supreme factor of
morale cannot be measured. We may dissipate
our material substance in a silly race for
prestige at home and abroad. Perhaps the
economy can recover from that dissipation. But
when the spirit and dedication of those who must
be our defenders in the bloody test for survival
are impaired, the loss is total, irreparable,
absolute.
