**Reparations in Manpower**

*by RAYMOND MOLEY*

A small item of news recently published may well provide the opening strains of a discussion which will truly reveal Russia's major demands in the peace-making. Professor Eugene Varga of Moscow, in a lecture in that city, said that since Germany has inflicted damages upon Russia vastly greater than those suffered by any other country, Russia should claim reparations commensurate with her losses and should have priority in such reparations. Professor Varga suggested that Russia might settle for ten years of work by 10,000,000 skilled workers. Also that this labor should be supplemented by repayment in money, livestock, machines and other deliveries.

That this is not mere academic vapor ing is indicated by the position of Varga in Soviet affairs. He has been close to Lenin, Krassin and Stalin since the revolution. As a Soviet economist, he enjoys the rare distinction of having his books officially distributed in various languages by Soviet embassies. As head of the "Russian Institute of World Economics," he is a person of importance in Moscow. It may be assumed that his statement is an authentic indication of official views.

The Varga figures of 100,000,000 labor-years, translated into money at the European 1939 average of $500 a year, amount to some $50,000,000,000. This, in purchasing power, would be about 70 per cent more than was claimed after the last war, and six to seven times as much as was actually paid. It would, if imposed, take from Germany more than one-fourth of her national income.

The reasoning behind the Varga proposal takes into account the economic value of Russians killed, of Russians used by Germans in forced labor and the destruction of inanimate wealth. There is stark logic in the idea, as well as a sort of Draconian justice.

In appraising it, it is important to remember at all times that Russia has a communistic economy in which wealth is measured in labor. Premier Stalin, as a peace negotiator, will be thinking in economic terms quite unlike those of his capitalistic partners. He would point out, no doubt, that with reference to reparations Versailles was a "capitalist" peace. In economic terms, that means that the Allies roughly calculated damages, translated that into labor-years and then into money values, and told Germany to work at home, produce wealth, translate it into money, and pay the money to the Allies. This will not satisfy Stalin, partly because he does not reckon in those terms and partly because "capital" reparations did not work out. The Germans simply did not pay.

The reasons they did not pay need not be elaborated. They claimed that they could not pay because, after the war, the Allies and the United States would not buy the products of their labor and, hence, that they had no money to pay with. It is significant also that French labor would not hear of German labor's being brought in to pay reparations in work. In a communist economy, the wealth is labor, and Russian labor has no means or reason for objecting to the bringing in of German and satellite labor.

There is no doubt that the Varga figures are pretty high. That is because they represent a position taken for the purposes of bargaining. But the idea illustrates the unique problem which will confront the peace-makers, since they represent different economic systems and speak different economic languages.

This proposal, however, presents two very bright spots in the present cloud of uncertainty which veils Russian relations. In the first place, it casts doubt upon the rumors that Germany and Russia might make a separate peace because Russia might offer better terms. These terms are much more severe than anything that Germany might expect from the Western Powers, even after unconditional surrender. For they take from Germany the very life blood of industrial as well as military power.

In the second place, they represent a demand that Russia cannot enforce alone. Unless all of Germany is under control, no workers can be exacted. Therefore Russia, to get even part of what she expects, will need the continued cooperation of the United States and Great Britain.

The Varga proposal reveals the real objectives of Russia in peace-making. Boundaries, spheres of influence, oil, gold, money, air or naval bases, even the Dardanelles, are secondary considerations with a communist nation. Labor is the supremely important thing.
