What Does Congress Represent?

by RAYMOND MOLEY

The trouble with the House of
Representatives is that it is not repre-
sentative. The fault is not in the
method of election or in its person-
nel. But its organization and methods
of operation do not correspond to the
vital interests of the nation. To a lesser
degree, the same criticism can be
applied to the Senate.

A legislative body should be or-
ganized so that basic eco-
nomic and political inter-
ests can find appropriate
and helpful contacts. In
such fields as agriculture
and interstate transporta-
tion, both the House and
Senate provide such specific
contacts. Powerful commit-
tees are geared to these
problems. And they are ex-
pertly served. But many
other segments of nation-
al life can find no such channels.

For this reason, it is good news
that Chairman Clarence F. Lea of the
House Committee on Interstate and
Foreign Commerce has recently set
up a standing subcommittee on Com-
merce and Trade, of which Percy
Priest of Tennessee is chairman.

A considerable amount of credit for
the creation of this subcommittee be-
longs to W. G. Herron of Washington.
Mr. Herron conducted a detailed sur-
vey of those Congressional agencies
whose concern is with some phase of
foreign and domestic trade. He made
the point that, while the Senate has
a committee on commerce which has
jurisdiction over broad economic ques-
tions, there has been no correspond-
ing committee in the House.

Even in matters affecting the De-
partment of Commerce, there has been
no specific House committee with
over-all authority. It was not until
the creation of the new subcommittee
that the House was able to find a
place for hearings on Secretary Wal-
lace's plan for a critically necessary
reorganization of his department.

This, of course, raises a funda-
mental question about Congress. De-
partments, bureaus and commissions
have been added to the Executive
branch of the government from time
to time, as some specific phase of
national life has become sufficiently
important to justify representation in
the government. But there has been
no functional growth in the commit-
tees of Congress. Neither in the choice
of members nor in the activities of
the various committees are the pri-
mary needs of the country repre-
sented.

The Ways and Means Committee
still deals with the tariff, although for
generations the tariff has not been a
matter of revenue, but of economic
policy. Because of the inadequacy of
the existing committee system, vast
power has been dumped
into the Committee on
Rules. Geographical consid-
erations are overlooked in
appointments. Great areas
of the country in which
lie the heart of our in-
dustrial system have al-
most no representation
among committee chairmen.

A tremendous national asset
is centered in the iron-ore
region around Lake Supe-
rior. And yet, of the 22 members of
the House Committee on Mines and
Mining, only one comes from the
states in that region.

There are committees which are
pure anachronisms. They have long
outlived their usefulness. There are
other committees whose duties are so
heterogeneous that their names no
longer have meaning. And the sen-
iority system has placed utter misfits
in many chairmanships. There are, in
fact, too many committees in both
houses. Many of the present commit-
tees should be abolished or reduced
to subcommittees, and some subcom-
mittees should be raised to the rank
of committees. It would seem that a
maximum of fifteen committees should
be enough for each house.

Beyond the streamlining of the sys-
tem should be new provision for
equipping committees and members
for effective work. Some academic
surveys of Congress have overstressed
the need for vast Congressional re-
search. But there is only a limited
need for original research by commit-
tees. A few competent lawyers, econ-
omists and clerks would be adequate,
for a committee can draw upon the
vast Executive establishment and
upon the almost unlimited resources
of private agencies. A committee does
not discover facts; it coordinates them.
Its members and employes must be
able to judge and evaluate.

We cannot expect Congress to
regain its lost influence until it mod-
ernizes itself.
