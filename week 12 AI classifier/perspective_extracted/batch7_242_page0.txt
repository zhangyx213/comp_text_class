**Who Makes Policy?**

*by RAYMOND MOLEY*

The assurance with which John L. Lewis has defied the Executive power of the government arises from a fact which Lewis knows and which the rest of us only dimly realize. That fact is that high policy is now being made neither by Congress, which should make it, nor by the Executive, which has made it for several years. In the present impasse, policy is made by the courts. And Lewis believes that whatever may happen lower down, he will find sanctuary in the Supreme Court. Judging by the record of the present majority, he has ample basis for his faith.

Unless the new Congress develops the statesmanship to take the making of policy into its own hands, we shall find ourselves governed for some time by New Deal ideas of the era 1935-39. The decisions of this Supreme Court provide ample basis for this danger. It has repeatedly extended the meaning of statutes in the general direction of New Deal objectives. It has restricted court reviews of the decisions of some administrative agencies, while permitting reviews of the decisions of other agencies. And in these cases, the favored agencies were those created in New Deal days. In a recent decision, the Court materially enlarged pay envelopes by writing into the law the Lewis portal-to-portal principle.  These are casual examples of what may be expected, a situation may recur which caused violent New Deal anger in the early Roosevelt years and which precipitated the court-packing battle in 1937. A dead hand may still play a major role in policymaking.

The scope of the Court in seizing the right to make policy is made wider by the peculiar nature of most of the New Deal laws. Most of them were hastily written. Whenever it became difficult to define powers, the habit was to throw wide discretion to the Executive. This gave the President wide power to determine policy. Now these gaps may be filled in by the Supreme Court, in line with its own prejudices and predilections.

Let us view the Lewis case as an immediate result of this condition. There are good lawyers, who certainly do not approve of John L. Lewis, who believe that Messrs. Truman, Clark and Krug are in a weak legal position, despite anything that may be decided in the District Court. The Supreme Court may ultimately decide that the Krug-Lewis contract in May carried over from the old contract of April the right claimed by Lewis to terminate the contract. If this turns out to be the case, it will be clear that, when the government took over the mines, it crippled itself with a clause which defeated its basic duty to protect the public health, safety and order.

The same lawyers say that the Norris-LaGuardia Act is not at all clear about the powers of the courts to issue restraining orders or injunctions in cases in which the government is a party. That, too, must be finally adjudicated by the Supreme Court. The Smith-Connally Act is not only unclear on the question of what constitutes a criminal conspiracy, but in the mind of John L. Lewis the act in its entirety is unconstitutional. Here again, his views may be sustained by the Supreme Court.

These instances illustrate a whole range of labor issues which will arise under the Wagner and other acts, in which the Supreme Court will be at liberty to create the final basis on which management and the public will have to live for a long time. The only way out of this situation will be a revision of the statute laws, so clear and so carefully drawn that the Executive will have ample weapons to protect the public interest and the courts will have no power to defeat the intent of Congress.

The situation would not be so ominous if the Executive could be counted on to lend a strong hand in the efforts of Congress to establish a lawful regime in industry. But the prestige and resourcefulness of the Executive have sadly deteriorated over the past year. It is clearly the responsibility of Congress to make high policy for the long future. But it will be the President's responsibility to meet immediate crises in industrial relations. Congress cannot mediate a strike or enforce the performance of essential services. Those are Executive functions. But Congress can implement the Executive with better definitions of authority and can prevent negative actions of the Supreme Court by clearer expressions of intent.
