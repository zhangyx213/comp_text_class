**THE ORDEAL OF DJILAS**

BY RAYMOND MOLEY

The panic with which a single individual can infect a seemingly well-established political regime is well shown by the ordeal that Tito's government has imposed upon Milovan Djilas. For Djilas has no hereditary claim to govern, no partisan following and only a few friends abroad. He has only the knowledge born of long experience in Communism and a capacity to write that borders on genius. His persecutors, despite their great authority, have failed to silence him. The torture of solitary confinement has failed. They dare not kill or exile him because of opinion in the two worlds between which Tito hovers so uneasily. All they can do now is to imprison him and deny him the materials to write.

Two items of news in April brought Djilas's name once more to the world outside Yugoslavia. A dispatch from Vienna to The Times of London says that a Swedish correspondent was arrested and expelled from Yugoslavia because he had an interview with Djilas's wife. Also, Harcourt, Brace & World has announced the publication of a biography by Djilas of Petrovic Njegos (Peter II) who was a prince, poet and bishop in Montenegro a century ago.

**IMPRISONMENT FOR VIEWS**

Prior to 1954 Djilas was one of the four leaders in the Communist government in Yugoslavia. His "crime" then was that he had aired in the press at home his views about the government and of Communism generally. He was expelled from the party and the government. In 1957 he was tried and imprisoned because of his expressed views about the suppression of the Hungarian revolt. But before that he had sent to the United States two books, "Land Without Justice" and "The New Class." The appearance of these led to further sentencing. During the early years of his imprisonment he was not only denied facilities for writing but was kept in an unheated cell.

Upon his release in 1961 he was visited by William Jovanovich, president of Harcourt and himself the son of a Montenegrin father, who brought back three manuscripts, one of them the Njegos biography. Later Djilas sent by mail the manuscript of "Conversations With Stalin," which was published at his request. The publication of that book resulted in the rearrest and the imprisonment of Djilas which continues today.

**DEDICATED MEN**

No doubt, the biography of Njegos will stand as his greatest work. My son Raymond Jr., whose special interest is in Slavic literature and Communist history, says this of the new publication:

"Djilas's account of Njegos is strange, exciting, reflective and revealing. From his own identification with the passions for liberty which made nineteenth-century Montenegro a symbol of independence in the Turkish-dominated Balkans, and his devotion to a revolutionary faith, Djilas is able to give a depth of understanding to a patriot who lived in another age. He writes of the land of his birth and of the poet and prince who became a bishop in 1830 in the Russian Orthodox Church.

"For centuries a tiny, bitter, rock-strewn, blood-splashed, brawling Montenegro had held out against the Turks. Free men retreated into the mountains and lived a tribal life. Only a Montenegrin bishop could hope to gain the allegiance which led to a unified state. And it was Njegos who achieved a semblance of order among the tribes by extending Orthodox authority to secular matters. Thus he prepared the way for a secular ruler and the recognition of Montenegro as a state in 1879.

"It is not surprising that Djilas found it so significant to write of a man whose dedication was like his own. In Njegos's fine works of poetry there is the conviction that man must fight for light and truth, against evil and tyranny, always in the name of freedom. Djilas ends his book with the line, 'One must not give in to evil.' Written into the book is Djilas's own disenchantment and, more relevantly, his rejection of contemporary Communism as an intolerable system- without justice, without liberty and without the inclination or capacity to tolerate dissent. Clearly shown are the insurmountable obstacles which confront world Communism, which denies the universal longings of men everywhere."
