**Perspective**

**Business and War**

One thing to remember in the trying days ahead is that history can never repeat itself exactly, so long as we all know a little history. We saw that rule operating in the stock and commodity markets at the outset of this war and, in the past week, we’ve seen it working again through the business leaders of the country.

The first casualty of the war in the United States is the old, vicious falsehood that businessmen want war and hope to see us enter it for the sake of unholy profits or "fool’s gold." Whatever may be the theory or the fact about business and our entry into the last war, this time the libel that war is caused by munition makers or steel makers or money lenders lies swimming in its own blood. Business leaders in America, so often inept at getting their case to the public, have scored a triumph in public relations and business statesmanship.

"American industry hates war," says the National Association of Manufacturers. "We can and must stay out of war." More, "industry opposes the utilization of war emergency to boost prices for the purpose of making excessive profits."

On three successive nights, Howard Coonley, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, Colby Chester and William B. Warner, past presidents, have amplified and explained these positions. "Industrialists of this country fear the dodges of war psychology," said Mr. Warner; "they prefer to face the task of solving difficult economic problems by the slow, and at times, cumbersome, but always sure democratic processes. Industry has no stomach for war. Let those whose standards permit choose that course; but the manufacturer will not capitalize catastrophe. His memory of the debacle of the last conflict is too fresh in mind."

"War is the greatest menace to industry. War destroys what industry builds," said Mr. Chester. "Even if a few should profit from war materials—in the end they too must succumb to the torrent of postwar debt. Only the gambler dares take a chance on war. And the management of business dares not gamble! They feel they have too much responsibility . . . to risk even a single spin of the roulette wheel."

"No sensible person believes that profit can come out of the wreckage of human life and economic dislocations," said Mr. Coonley.


Acceptances of these pledges have been pouring in from all over the country. "We pledge ourselves to be governed by these policies and principles," announces Lammot du Pont. "Endorse without reservation," says Alfred P. Sloan of General Motors Corporation. "We pledge ourselves to equitable price relationship and believe peace is imperative," wires H. W. Prentis Jr. of Armstrong Cork Company. "Your statement has our complete endorsement," affirms W. S. S. Rodgers of the Texas Company.

The Wall Street Journal, reflecting opinion of the financial center of the country, has made similar assertions. Likewise the Chamber of Commerce of the United States. Likewise Charles Belknap, executive vice president of the Monsanto Chemical Co. of St. Louis, who cogently points out that the chemical industry opposes participation in war because "wars are invariably followed by business depressions . . . War disrupts peacetime progress, substitutes temporary profits and long-term taxes for the long-term real profits of planned research and development." There have been few occasions when business opinion in this country has so promptly and with such unanimity taken a position on a public question.

Despite the rantings of some critics of business, the last war taught the American people many things. One is that higher prices do not necessarily mean greater profits to business; that hoarding by consumers always raises prices and that hoarding is not controllable by manufacturers; that public speculation in commodity and stock markets is not chargeable to industrial leaders, and that prices of many world commodities in manufacturing are actually beyond domestic control, private or governmental. Another is that war isn’t the answer to a single one of our domestic problems.

**Peace Without Victory**

Almost blanketed by war news is the story of the maneuvers and pressures that are preceding the annual meetings of the two wings of organized labor—a significant story both in political and industrial terms.

For some time after the peace negotiations under White House auspices broke off last spring, no competent observer could foresee any new compelling reason for a resumption of peace efforts. Now, both internal and external forces have changed the situation.

The rank and file in both A.F.L. and C.I.O. are getting sick and tired of jurisdictional struggles. It has become obvious to thousands of dues-paying union members in both camps that if they are going to have to go on paying dues and assessments to finance intra-labor squabbles, like those in the automobile industry, there is no limit to the amount of money they may have to put up. They know that they are pouring out their substance to fight with each other.

Many of the rank and file are getting full employment for the first time in many years. They realize that business management on the whole is prepared to grant wage increases where orders are heavy and prices rising. They don’t propose to be separated from jobs under such circumstances because of the feud between C.I.O. and A.F.L. leadership.

Moreover, they are impatient with both the bitterness of the Green-Lewis brawl and the personal displeasure of both leaders with Roosevelt. Tobin, Hillman and others in both the C.I.O. and A.F.L. have indicated clearly their disgust that the course of the labor movement should be deflected because of personal piques. A feeling seems to be growing that the Lewis-Green vendetta is a pretty expensive form of personal indulgence.

One important external force is the Administration’s desire for a united labor movement before 1940. There is likelihood of a strong appeal for peace by President Roosevelt. And in the background of such a plea there is always the unspoken threat of more "controls" of labor by government if the war emergency continues.

Beyond all these is the force of the public feeling that, in an emergency, strikes—especially jurisdictional strikes—are a luxury the nation cannot afford.

All this does not necessarily mean that labor unity is in the offing. The fact that no one proposes an affiliation of such independent unions as the Railroad Brotherhoods with the A.F.L. or C.I.O. makes it obvious that it is not unity that is needed but an end of the wasteful jurisdictional struggle. And that we are likely to see, if not by official action of the Green and Lewis high command, then certainly by the growing force of rank-and-file sentiment.
