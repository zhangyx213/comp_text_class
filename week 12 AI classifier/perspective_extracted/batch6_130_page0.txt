**Schools for War Babies**

by Raymond Moley

THERE is grumbling among school
people about the pallor of the gravy
in the President's school-building program. There are loud cries from politicians like Senator Hill about the lack of pork under the gravy. For these reasons the President's suggestions seem modest by comparison with what might have been. Nevertheless, there is an apologetic tone in the President's explanation of the reasons why he has bypassed the constitutional principle of local responsibility to which he has so often paid fervent tribute. There is something fearsome in the multitude of war babies grown to school age which overwhelms even the strictest constitutionalists. The late Senator Taft was once induced to sponsor a bill for Federal aid to education. His defense of the bill in the Senate was not in the best Taft tradition. When he was asked by a colleague how the Federal octopus was to be kept out of local school affairs if Federal money were given, he answered that the bill contained all the words which he could muster to prevent such an invasion. He knew quite well that words are not enough. For lurking in the shadow of every Federal dollar, wherever it may go, is a Federal bureaucrat. If it is Federal money the Federal government is responsible for its use. On this constitutional background the President's program must be evaluated. Since it represents a distinct advance of Federal authority over the already depleted powers of the states and local communities, there should be a clear answer to two questions: What and where are the needy communities? Is there any other way consistent with traditional state responsibility to get the money for the building that may be necessary? The plan itself hardly matches the ballyhoo about a "Seven Billion Dollar School Plan." Maybe it will be $7 billion, maybe not. It will be sure to cost Uncle Sam more than a billion over three years and maybe two. Whether $7 billion will be spent by everyone concerned nobody can know. The financial plan is fourfold.

1-The Federal government would buy $750 million over three years of the bonds of districts which have not reached their borrowing limit.

2-The Federal government would match state money to pay interest on bonds issued by school-building authorities (which would be public corporations) organized for the purpose. These authorities would rent the buildings to school districts too poor to build their own schools.

3-For districts too poor to participate in either of the foregoing plans the Federal government would provide $200 million in grants over three years.

4-The Federal government would provide $20 million over three years toward administrative expenses for the foregoing.

The plan would give a great deal of discretion to the U.S. Commissioner of Education and if he were an economical person devoted to the principle of state responsibility he could keep Federal spending to a minimum. A provision in the bill would lift his financial transactions above "review by any other government official." This is mischievous nonsense. There is no evidence in the President's message, nor in the other documents and statements issued by the Administration in support of this plan, that a truly careful appraisal of the real needs and the financial resources of the local districts has been made. To a large degree the Administration seems to accept ex parte estimates of beneficiary states and districts. We are asked to accept a figure more or less pulled out of the air with the assurance that after it is authorized by the Congress, the Administration will in its discretion spend it wisely. Nor has the Administration faced the fact that by returning to the states and local government such a tax as is now levied upon amusements, school needs could be met by the states and districts without Federal help.

ALSO the President might have waited to hear from his own Commission on Intergovernmental Relations which has a very competent task force under the chairmanship of Dr. Adam Bennion of Utah. It has prepared a good report on this subject.
