**PERSPECTIVE**

**Two Indispensable Men**

*by Raymond Moley*

THE Republican National Committee, like its counterpart on the Democratic side, has limited authority but great importance. That is now underlined because there is no Republican President and also because a Presidential campaign is coming for which preparations must be made.  Because of tradition, as well as the nature of our government, authority in a national party is widely scattered. The Republican minorities in Congress have their own tasks and their own leaders. There are two campaign committees, one in the Senate and one in the House, whose functions are to help elect Republican candidates for Congress. Every state and local unit has its own organization and chairman who operate in their areas. There are also Republican auxiliary organizations.

The National Committee directly or through its committees selects the site and makes the arrangements for the quadrennial convention of the party. Once organized, the convention runs itself, and a new National Committee and usually a new chairman are chosen.

But despite these limitations, the National Committee and its chairman have a vast potentiality for influence. The national chairman, in the absence of a Republican President, can or should be a voice, perhaps the most important voice, of the party. He makes innumerable addresses expounding party principles, inspires and advises local party groups and supervises money-raising. At the present time he has under his direction a committee staff of more than a hundred members in Washington.

**MILLER AS SPOKESMAN**

Thus, the job of the national chairman is twofold. He is a spokesman for the party, and he is the manager of an important administrative staff.  Upon William E. Miller, the national chairman, there fall these tasks, as well as his job of representing the interests of the 40th New York District in Congress. Chairman Miller is a brilliant spokesman for his party. As a debater for the opposition he is, in my judgment, without an equal among those Republicans who are now active. Congressional leaders are very busy with their parliamentary duties. Republican state governors are busy with state affairs. Miller, in fact, is so resourceful, knowledgeable, and forceful that it is strange that no one has suggested him as a capable opponent against President Kennedy in 1964. His choice, however, is to remain where he is.

But the incessant demands upon his time and the very nature of the national chairman's office leave him little time for the management of the National Committee's staff and for the advice and assistance which party units over the nation so desperately need. In short, the National Committee needs two men—one with the exceptional talents of Miller; the other, a master of organization.

**BLISS AS MANAGER**

There is little disagreement among Republicans as to the identity of an individual who is magnificently qualified for the job of management. That is Ray C. Bliss, chairman of the Ohio State Central Committee since 1949. His first statewide success came with the re-election of Senator Taft in 1950. His organization carried the state for Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956. In 1956 his candidate for governor was elected. But in 1958 advocates of right-to-work put the issue on the ballot against Bliss's advice, and disaster ensued. But immediately after the defeat he began building up the Ohio Republican Party, and in 1960 Nixon-Lodge carried the state by the largest Republican majority in the nation. In 1962 his achievement was amazing. Republicans swept the state, electing a governor, a legislative majority, and eighteen of the state's 24 members of the House. Bliss's esteem among state chairmen is shown by the fact that since 1953 he has been chairman of the Midwest and Rocky Mountain Republican State Chairmen's Association.

Bliss does not care to do much public speaking. He is essentially a manager. The Republican National Committee needs the talents of both Miller and Bliss. They are sufficiently friendly so that they could work together. To acquire two such talents as a team is a wonderful opportunity for the Republican Party.
