**They Grow and Grow**
by Raymond Moley

WHAT the President and Congress
need most of all is a course of
serious instruction in planned parenthood. For the major argument made
for this enormous budget is that many
programs have already been started
which need financial nourishment
from year to year and that they have
a first claim.

In the beginning, a proposed project comes from the bureaucracy. This
is "sold" to the Cabinet and the President with all sorts of assurance of
repayment from charges, tolls, or what
not. Meanwhile, interested states and
communities bombard their representatives with frantic appeals. Then
Congress passes an authorization embellished with fraudulent figures of
cost and trick bookkeeping concerning repayment. Once the project is
born, it grows and grows.

Spending for these programs begets
inflation, and inflation increases their
annual cost, thus completing the vicious circle. Presidents and Congress-
men come and go, but their offspring
enjoy the twin qualities of proliferation and longevity.

Since the President's budget for
1958 is enlarged not only by many
of these old programs but proposes
several new ones, it might be profitable to examine the amazing growth
of a big project conceived many
years ago and born in 1954, the St.
Lawrence Seaway.

**SQUEEZE ON TOLLS**

I am not suggesting that this is not
a worthy public enterprise. If properly built and managed, it may well
add billions to the national wealth in
the Great Lakes region. But it cannot
be denied that it was misrepresented
to the American people and that the
bill creating it was a flagrant piece
of deception.

The American part of the project
was to cost $105 million. Tolls were
to pay for it in 50 years.

Now there come to Congress Dr.
N.R. Danielian, representing several
shippers' groups, and also Lewis G.
Castle, head of the building authority
for the project, asking for $35 million
more money.

These two gentlemen agree on
the need for additional money. But
Danielian doubts the ability of shippers to pay the cost in the time originally estimated. Castle is swimming
in a cloud of optimism.

The additional money is to pay for
many fundamental changes in plans.
It would seem that, despite the fact
that this seaway has been discussed
for decades, the 1954 bill was a jerry-
built affair.

This new demand for money fails
to take account of rising prices. At
the moment, informed estimates
put the cost of the presently planned
project at upwards of twice the
1954 estimate.

**EXTRA NEEDS**

This cost, it should be noted, is
for the job now 30 per cent completed
in the St. Lawrence itself. It does not
take account of the cost of improving
Great Lakes harbors and other items,
such as deepening the Detroit River.
It should also be appreciated that the
planned channel favors foreign ships,
and if American ships in foreign commerce are to participate to any degree, there must be not only operating
subsidies but more subsidies to build
ships of practical size.

While the ship subsidy makes up
the difference between domestic costs
and those prevailing abroad, losses
are a private risk. But half the profits
above 10 per cent are subject to recapture by the government. Therefore, it is to the interest of the
government to make the use of the
seaway as profitable as possible.

It should also be noted that the
members of Congress who favored this
project in 1954 had to win support
from fellow members in the South
and West by promising to support
their pet projects. That logrolling cost
may well be illimitable.

The danger pointed out by Danielian
is that if tolls are raised to provide
repayment of the cost of the seaway,
shippers will be driven to other forms
of transportation. This would reduce
revenue and make repayment an even
more remote possibility.

I repeat that this project is a good
and proper one for the Federal government to undertake. But its history
should warn us of the danger of starting new ones, such as school construction, before we know what the
old ones will cost.
