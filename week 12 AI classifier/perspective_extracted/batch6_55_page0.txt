**Toil, Sweat, Volunteers**
by Raymond Moley

You, sovereign American, have just been treated to two weeks of what, with some disparagement, you would call entertainment. If that show was not what you would deem appropriate to serious business, blame yourself. The actors, with a few notable exceptions, were not just clowns or insincere rogues. They were people who give time and energy to the serious job of governing a nation. In order to get your interest they put on antics which would not be given for a more serious deliberation.

Those politicians—the legally constituted officers of the parties, national, state, and local—will now labor several weeks to get some of you to vote. If the past is any guide, they will mobilize only half of your number.

Twenty years ago Democrats, notably President Roosevelt, realized the need of auxiliaries, and the answer to their need was the CIO-PAC. Now, since the merger, it is the AFL-CIO Committee on Political Education—COPE. It will reach millions who are beyond the efforts of the Democratic Party organizations. COPE will be working against the conservatives everywhere, mostly against Republicans in the North. It is committed to an extravagantly "liberal" program.

**CONSERVATIVE AUXILIARIES**

Those who could and should create comparable local auxiliaries for conservative candidates and principles are business and professional people who have usually been indifferent or afraid. Perhaps because demagogues have railed so much against business in government, they are stricken with the fear that they are not wanted in politics. Thus it has been good politics to be anti-business because it causes businessmen to be nonpolitical. But we must have more businessmen in politics or there will be a whale of a lot more politics in business.

Fortunately, there have been encouraging signs that conservative people have been awakening from their state of political impotence. In one city, as long ago as 1946, a group of men, mostly managers of industries, organized themselves as an auxiliary group to elect a Republican member of Congress. They turned a 40,000 New Deal majority into a 40,000 Republican majority. They are still operating on a larger scale in the city.

In Los Angeles there is an organization called Republican Associates which, under the direction of a board of trustees of leading business and professional men, carries on through a full-time, salaried staff to train volunteer precinct workers, to enlist the political interest of junior executives, college teachers, and students, and to publish enlightening literature on conservative political principles.

In Cuyahoga County, Ohio (Cleveland), there is a group of leading industrial managers which originated, in the Taft campaign for the Senate in 1950, an organized effort to provide for the Republican Party an auxiliary volunteer army of precinct workers. In 1952 there were 2,000 such workers. There will be more this year.

**PRINCIPLES IN COMMON**

In all three of these instances there is concentration on members and candidates for Congress. One of the principles common to all three is that if you get a vote for a Republican member of Congress, the vote is assured for the national ticket.

Another principle common to all three is that the legally constituted party organization must neither be bypassed nor embarrassed. The idea is to mesh the know-how and experience of the regulars with the enthusiasm of the amateur volunteers. So far as there is honor or public recognition, the volunteers let the regulars take the bows. They are also careful not to take contributions which might go to the regular organization. In fact, they help the regulars financially.

The work that these auxiliaries carry on can be done on a smaller scale anywhere this fall—in a suburb, a single precinct, a street, an apartment, or in those vital, new housing developments which have grown like mushrooms beyond the suburbs.

As a sovereign American, if you don't want to join the activities of a party, this is a way to work for good government and conservative principles with the party and candidates most nearly representative of those principles. The job is to get a lazy electorate to the polls on Election Day. That is the payoff.
