Dangerous Curves
by RAYMOND MOLEY

DALLAS—It is difficult to use the word
"socialistic" in any reasonable
discussion of public issues because of
the abuse to which that once accurate
term has been subjected. For years it
has been the habit of extreme reac-
tionaries to scream "socialistic" at every
proposal to extend the service of gov-
ernment, even in the most harmless and
obvious ways. Thus, it has been called
socialistic to provide free
water and free education.
But a batch of measures
has appeared in the present
Congress to which the term
socialistic can be applied
reasonably and accurately.
Most of these measures have
been drafted by people in
the Administration; some
have the direct approval of
the President; and none
have met with his public disapproval.
In fact, it would seem that the Presi-
dent has interpreted his victory as a
mandate to move on beyond Roosevelt
in pushing the Federal government
into all sorts of new ventures in bu-
reaucracy.

THERE is his health-insurance plan,
which is now a hardy perennial.
There was the Spence bill, which pre-
scribed an amazing plan for general
regimentation and which, fortunately,
now seems to have been placed far
down on the waiting list.
But two other measures are very
much alive and, together, they would
move American agriculture, once the
repository of the deepest tradition of
individualism, into a happy coma of
well-heeled servitude. The first is the
new agricultural scheme of Secretary
of Agriculture Brannan. The second
is the Pogue bill, which would put the
government into the telephone busi-
ness.
The Brannan plan would provide a
government-guaranteed farm income
for a large proportion of the farms of
the country, based on the average of
the years 1939 to 1948. In the years
after 1950, the farmer who benefits by
this plan would be far better off than
the recipient of social security, who
has no such guarantee of purchasing
power.
Moreover, the old drive to limit all
incomes at $25,000 a year reappears
in this plan in provisions aimed di-
rectly at farmers who produce a vol-
ume estimated at about $26,000 a
year. By a direct discrimination in the
granting of benefits, these large farm-
ers—who number probably not more
than 2 per cent of the farmers but who
produce a much larger proportion of
the crops—would be under pressure
either to go out of business or to split
up their farms.
An interesting aspect of
this is the parallel with land
reforms in other countries in
past years where social sal-
vation seemed to be envis-
aged in breaking up large
land-holding. The kulaks in
Russia were thus singled out.
It is somewhat anomalous to
apply this to present-day
America, where the evils of
large farms are not present
and where, because of mechanization,
it is possible to serve consumers with
more economy through large opera-
tions.
But the votes lie with the great mass
of those who would be benefited by
the plan. All that these beneficiaries
would lose is their freedom.
The Pogue telephone bill is an
amendment to an extension of the
rural electrification system. Under this
bill the Rural Electrification Adminis-
tration would be authorized to make
loans for bringing telephone service to
areas where private operation is unable
economically or safely to extend its
own lines. Easy lending conditions
would in reality provide for the people
thus benefited a service at the expense
of the generality of taxpayers. Prefer-
ence in loans would be given to co-
operatives and public agencies.
The issue is whether the private
companies are doing their job as well
as might be expected. The fact is that
rural telephone service is being very
rapidly extended to rural areas. In
1940, 25 per cent of American farms
had telephones. The figure is now 42
per cent. Considering shortages and
labor in the years between, this would
seem to be a growth sufficiently large
to justify letting private enterprise fin-
ish the job.

THESE two measures are representa-
tive of a drive toward a quite un-
necessary and expensive kind of social-
ism.
