**Sowing the Wild Wind**

**by Raymond Moley**

PORTLAND, ORE.—The decisive defeat in the Senate of the bill to repudiate the Federal Power Commission and to authorize a Federal dam in Hells Canyon has been a hard blow to what some might call the prestige of the man who so ardently promoted it, Sen. Wayne Morse. It not only measurably impairs his chance of re-election but betrays a blind lack of political judgment in bringing the matter to a head this year. For the measure would never have reached the President’s desk, where Morse hoped it might be an embarrassment. The House would have slaughtered it. Even before the FPC after many months of hearings had acted favorably on the Idaho Power Co.’s application to build three dams with private investors’ money, the proposal had never been permitted to get out of committees. This recent blindness to political realities may well lose Morse his seat to the peppery, aggressive Douglas McKay.

**FRIEND INTO FOE**

For Morse, by his indiscriminate attacks on all who disagree with him, has so bitterly incensed his former friends and supporters that many of them may at long last make a determined effort to defeat him. Many of those former friends and supporters are willing to concede Morse’s right to change his party; better men have set that example. Some even admire the infinite variety of his claims to expert opinion. Everyone can see some humor in the stupefying boredom of his speeches, to which no one has to listen but the lesser employees of the Senate. His advocacy of Federal collectivism may be the most sincere thing about the man. The sterility of his legislative record can be understood; long ago he elected to make a career of words, not deeds. His own representation of “facts” would raise a moral issue except for the mitigating circumstance that they come from a mind, like Stassen’s, tortured by vanity and frustration. But former friends and supporters cannot forgive his attributing to them gross ignorance and selfish exploitation of the public. Those people who helped Morse in 1944 when he first ran for the Senate have tried to serve their state, to build up its economy, and to contribute to its civic life. They bitterly resent the man who, in the enjoyment of his exalted forum, builds a wall of contempt, distrust, and hatred between them and their neighbors and would set them off as untouchables, unfit for public office or public trust. They feel that his reckless attacks, particularly on the press and private business, array class against class and shatter the pattern of friendly community life. But as I have observed politics in Oregon in the course of many visits to the state, and as I have known Morse since he was a student at Columbia University 26 years ago, I can see a pattern in this demagoguery. Morse is not so much concerned with converting the generality of voters as in planting in the minds of business managers a sense of helplessness. He wants to keep them out of politics, and his strategy has so far measurably succeeded. If there had been a strong drive by conservatives such as marked the campaign for Taft in Ohio in 1950, Morse would never have been re-elected in that year. A vigorous stirring of people of capacity and influence in Oregon in 1954 might have prevented the election of Senator Neuberger. The question this year is whether the neglect which prevailed in those two unfortunate occasions will or will not be repeated.

**THE JOB TO DO**

Douglas McKay is the logical candidate to oppose Morse, since his record as Secretary of the Interior will be the major issue. That record is good and can be adequately defended. McKay is making an aggressive campaign. But the people of Oregon who want to be rid of Morse cannot expect the candidate to do it alone. Nor can they expect the party organization to do it alone. Nor can they depend upon what the President can do by the strength of his candidacy and his endorsement of McKay. Citizen action to get out the conservative vote will be needed. This will mean more than contributions of money. It will mean manpower to carry the campaign from door to door and street to street. And the same prescription might well be observed in other states this year.
