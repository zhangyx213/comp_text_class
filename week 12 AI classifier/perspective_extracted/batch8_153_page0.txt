**The Third-Term Issue**

The third term as an issue is only
beginning to come to the fore in this campaign. But it is the domestic issue that
contains more dynamite than any other.
If the Republicans fail to set it off, they
will be missing their best chance of blasting the Administration. Other issues are
susceptible of many interpretations. Speed
or lack of speed in preparing for defense
can be glossed over. The need for better
administration of the social and economic
reform agencies can be argued without
much point. But the fact that Mr. Roosevelt is violating a tradition of 150 years is
something that is subject to no equivocation. It is clear and definite, and the argument against it is powerfully appealing.
The possibilities of the issue are suggested by the desperate attempts of the
Democrats to ignore it. The platform did
not mention it. The President's acceptance
speech skirted all around it. Mr. Wallace
passed it over. Mr. Flynn skips it in his
daily routine. There is hardly a Democrat-
ic politician who would not privately admit the explosive qualities of the issue.
For they are thoroughly aware of the fact
that it is important not only directly, and
on its merits, but indirectly. It is the rare
kind of issue that permits a voter to explain his vote to his friends in terms of a
fine principle of government rather than a
personal preference.

Every experienced politician knows
that when great numbers of people switch
votes, a considerable percentage of them
will not be quite clear about the real reason for their shift or will be shifting for
reasons they don't feel they can conveniently defend. It may be that they're just
plain tired of the incumbent. It may be
that they dislike him personally or harbor
a grudge about some injury they've suffered at the hands of government. It may
be that they like to be on the side they
think will win.

Part of the purpose of campaign
speeches is to give such voters sound and
satisfying explanations for doing what
they want to do. That is why slogans,
pungent sayings and aphorisms are so important in a campaign. That is why the
candidates try to sprinkle their speeches
with succinct and easily remembered sentences. The third term is a perfect subject for this kind of political art. It suggests half a hundred phrases to the resourceful campaigner-from statements
about "a monopoly of power" to frequent and embarrassing quotation of the President's old comment that there is no indispensable man, only indispensable principle.

But beyond this, there is real substance
to the issue. It presents a striking intellectual challenge. The historical arguments
against the third term are good, so far as
historical arguments are ever good. It's
true that Washington did not specify that
he was retiring because of a fundamental
aversion to a third term on the basis of
principle. Yet, when he contemplated retirement at the end of his first term, he indicated in the draft of a farewell address prepared for use at that time that rotation
in the elective officers of government was
a corollary of the ideas that the people
have about liberty.

Jefferson, from the first, regarded the
Constitution as gravely defective in its
failure to prohibit perpetuation of the
President in office. He stated the case
clearly over and over again. He not only
followed the rule himself, but impressed it
upon his successors.

Jackson recommended an amendment
to the Constitution limiting the President
to a single term of either four or six years.
This recommendation appears in six of his
eight messages to Congress. He answered
the argument of "experience" which we
now hear so much in these cogent words:
"There are, perhaps, few men who can for
any great length of time enjoy office and
power without being more or less under
the influence of feelings unfavorable to
the faithful discharge of their public duties . . . I cannot but believe that more is
lost by the long continuance of men in
office than is generally to be gained by
their experience."

So the third-term rule became a tradition in American government.

But arguments on the basis of quotation all suffer this weakness: They set off long and confusing discussions about
what the President who is quoted did or
didn't mean when he said this or that. In
any case, the gist of the matter is the simple human reason why the tradition grew
up in the first place—the reason that was
behind the words and the acts of the men
who built the tradition.

The Constitution vests enormous power
in the President. No man, no matter how
able or noble or great, can be immune to
the insidious effects of such power. It
closes the windows of the mind to fresh, invigorating currents of opinion from the
outside. It inevitably invites the flattery
that produces a conviction of infallibility.
It produces a growing identification of
self with the will of the people. Its possession tends to blur over the distinction between personal triumph and the exaltation of principle. It is for this precise
reason that constitutions are set up. For if
it is unnecessary to guide and restrain and
regulate those who possess power, why do
we not have a government of men, pure
and simple?

Today the President has more power
than any other President in American history. He has more money to spend. He is
the head of an Administration with more
employees and with more direct financial
beneficiaries. He has more absolute control
of his party, more influence over Congress.
The issue of power entrenching itself is
more critical at this moment than it ever
has been in the past 150 years.

The United States has been a
model for a score of democratic republics throughout the world—particularly
throughout Latin America. The tendency
of Presidents to become dictators over our
good neighbors to the south has long been
observed. By every hook or crook, by the
use of military power, patronage, bribery,
Presidents in certain Latin-American nations have kept themselves in power despite the plainest constitutional prohibitions. In Mexico, at the present time, an
opposition candidate for President has
practically been driven into exile by the
incumbent machine. Even the Philippines
are having a little case of Presidentitis.
Mr. Quezon seems to think he too is indispensable. If at this moment the United
States, with its colossal power to set standards in the Western Hemisphere, champions the doctrine of the indispensable
man, even the semblance of constitutional
government must suffer a dreadful blow.
Can we afford to set such an example? If
we can, then why all the talk of preserving
democratic institutions throughout the
world?

Yes, the prohibition against a third term
is a tradition. But the substance of the
principle behind it has not vanished. To
say that it has is to say that human nature
has changed or that Mr. Roosevelt is unlike any other man. Let's argue those
points in the open. Let's see Mr. Roosevelt's supporters make the case that this
President is unlike any other President
and this moment is unlike any other moment. Let's find out what, if we break the
tradition now, we intend to use as a principle in future. The President and his supporters have said nothing so far about a
fourth term. Why are they silent, if not
because they fear to raise the question of
why he should override the third-term tradition?
