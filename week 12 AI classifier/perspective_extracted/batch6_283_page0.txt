**Estonian Venture**

In the summer of 1945, when the 30,000 Estonian refugees in Sweden and Finland were under Soviet pressure to return, sixteen of them (seven men, five women, and four children) set out from Stockholm across the Atlantic in a 37-foot, 50-year-old sloop, the Erma, built by the rugged standards of an earlier time for Swedish coastal service. One of them, Voldemar Veedam, after working as a common laborer in the United States, has written an account of the voyage, "Sailing to Freedom," with Carl Wall.  The food supply consisted largely of 1,000 pounds of potatoes, supplemented with generous gifts in Scotland and Ireland, and thrifty purchases in Madeira. Finally, when all supplies were exhausted and the Erma helpless after a storm, 100 miles from Norfolk and 126 days out of Stockholm, an American naval vessel poured down upon it great stores of ham, eggs, milk, coffee, cocoa, bread, brandy, and cigarettes. Most of the refugees are now American citizens, and have been soldiers, yacht captains, college students, and social workers. The Erma converted into a family pleasure boat, they sold for $500. The narrative is in a breezy patter that does not sound very Estonian, but it does not matter; nothing can spoil it. (SAILING TO FREEDOM. By Voldemar Veedam and Carl B. Wall. 246 pages.

**The Way to Liberty**

The underlying purpose of the first half of Raymond Moley's "How to Keep Our Liberty" is to demonstrate that the policies of statism are a grim threat, not merely to the higher-income groups, but to the immense majority of the American people. The latter half of the book discusses the possible ways in which the menace of these policies may be made clear in terms of daily living and the people mobilized to use the polls to defeat them. The book is consequently the rarest kind of work of political philosophy, one combining its abstract theory with a practical handbook for political action. The tone is moderate, the demonstration of the cost of statism unimpassioned and apparently unanswerable, and the proposed remedies simple, within reach of all voters, and seemingly as likely to succeed as any course of action in anything so uncertain as a Presidential election. After a somewhat tentative beginning, summarizing the underlying principles of the American constitutional system, Moley settles down to a factual review of the forms of government intervention in the Roosevelt and Truman Administrations-into state and local tax sources; into business, with some 100 Federal enterprises ($20,000,000,000) selling fertilizers, farm produce, and operating ships, foundries, and railroads, with 40 government agencies lending money; into medicine, in which the government's expenditures ($2,000,000,000) are greater than the expenditures for socialized medicine in Britain in two years under the Labor government; into the electrical utility business; into cooperatives which now number 32,246 ($7,182,185,001 in 1945) and handle, for example, 75 per cent of all the milk sold in the country; into welfare, which in 1950 (Federal, state, and local) cost $14,330,000,000, nearly double the amount of all corporate dividends, more than the income of all the farms, and more than the average cost of Federal, state, and local governments in the 1930s.
