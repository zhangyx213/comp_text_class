How to say "whoa"
to a landing craft

Most landing craft, patrol vessels, and
small boats use Diesel engines for their main
source of power. The Diesel engine is used
because it is rugged and economical.

Changing the rate of speed of a Diesel en-
gine is done with a Diesel engine governor-
a mysterious-looking black box with a control
knob as shown in the above illustration. The
Diesel engine governor works hydraulically.

A simple adjustment of the control dial auto-
matically sets the speed of the engine.

The operation is automatic, because a
small Bodine motor drives the governor ad-
justment. This simplifies the switching mech-
anism and control wiring.

Bodine fractional horsepower motors are
frequently chosen to do such unusual tasks.

In both wartime and peacetime applications,
Bodine has pioneered in the small motor
field. Their 35 years experience is available
to help you select the correct kind and type
of electric motor for your postwar motor-
driven appliances.

The Sinews of the Parties

by RAYMOND MOLEY

After every campaign, conversa-
tion flourishes among amateur political
strategists about what the defeated
candidate should or should not have
said. It seems thus to be assumed that
campaigns are won or lost by what is
said or left unsaid by the candidates.
But it is very clear that nothing that
Mr. Dewey said or could have said
would have elected him. The war and
political organization affected the re-
sult so profoundly that words and
phrases were futile.

But what was said was said, and no
useful purpose is served by an inquest
over yesterday's speeches. The concern
of every American is what the two
major parties can do to maintain free
government in this country. And that
question can be answered only after
we determine what the parties are,
who belongs to them, how they will
operate and what they can became in
the four years ahead.

Curiously enough, the victorious
party presents the more serious prob-
lems. Regular Democrats privately ad-
mit grave concern over the future of
their party. The figures already show
a tremendous acceleration of a trend
in the Northern and Western States
toward a concentration of Democratic
strength in the larger cities and in-
dustrial counties, with a corresponding
increase of Republican strength in the
country and in small towns. The figures
on this trend are not all available but
a few examples will suffice.

In Illinois, Mr. Roosevelt carried
only seventeen counties in this elec-
tion. In 1940, he carried 28, and in
1936, he carried 72.

In Indiana, he carried seventeen
counties this year. In 1940, he carried
32 and in 1936, 72.

In Ohio, he carried only thirteen
counties this year, but in 1940 the
number was 60 and in 1936 it was 62.

In Pennsylvania, the Roosevelt tick-
et carried only eight counties in 1944,
23 in 1940 and 42 in 1936.

This decline in counties carried by
the Democratic candidate cannot be
explained in terms of an over-all de-
cline in state majorities. It repre-
sents mounting majorities in the great
cities, accompanied by shrinkage of
votes in the remaining sections of the
states. The Democratic party, to a
greater extent than ever before, is a
big-city party. Dependence for suc-
cess in a national election must rest


on city organizations or machines and
on politically organized labor. That is
why such figures as Mayors Kelly of
Chicago, Hague of Jersey City and
the various leaders in New York City
and Albany are much more than ora-
torical devices. They hold in their
hands real power over the Administra-
tion in Washington. That is also why
Mr. Hillman's PAC emerges as a po-
litical influence of first importance.

Two Democratic worries are in-
volved in this situation. The first is the
worry of Southern Democrats over the
new people with whom they must
share the custody of their party. The
second is the worry of the big-city
leaders over the growing influence of
the PAC in their own organizations.

This picture also suggests the op-
portunity and the problem of the Re-
publican organization over the years
ahead. Republicans are entrenched in
many hundreds of court houses and in
23 state houses. This represents not a
single party, but hundreds of organi-
zations of all sorts and conditions. The
jobs and patronage essential to vital
party life are there, but Mr. Dewey,
as leader of his party, and his chair-
man must weld together this mass of
pieces.

In the practical and vital materials
out of which a party is built, which,
sad as it may seem, are jobs and pa-
tronage, the score is easily reckoned.
The Democrats have all the patronage
in the South and vast numbers of jobs
in most of the large Northern cities.
They also have the tremendous Fed-
eral bureaucracy of some 3,000,000.
And they have the CIO-PAC as an
ally.

Thus, the task of Republican lead-
ers will be to make of their traditional
sources of strength, the vast county
and state organizations, a working na-
tional party. The task of Democrats is
to compromise the differences between
Southern Democracy, the city-machine
citadels of power and the strange and
new radicalism of the CIO-PAC into
team-work.

The future success of the parties
will depend on many things other than
these opposing organizations. But the
welding together of the assorted bits
of machinery described above is the
major task of party leaders on both
sides. The destiny of the United States
is involved in this competition.
