**The White-Housing Shortage**

**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

When Republican leaders were unloading the late W. Gamaliel Harding on the country, they said, stifling a laugh meanwhile, that their limp offering would surround himself with able men. That was supposed to make everything all right.

It is not intended in this piece to draw Presidential comparisons. But since those politicians who prevail in Washington sold Harry S. Truman, at the Chicago convention and, later, after the death of President Roosevelt, as an average man, they ought to explain why their chief has not surrounded himself with more-than-average assistants.

I am not referring to the Cabinet, but to the most important niche in the nation—the White House. We read of a $1,600,000 building program to expand White House capacity. This will be undertaken on the theory, presumably, that quantity can take the place of quality. But the more stately mansions needed in the enclosure on Pennsylvania Avenue involve stature, not acreage.

The really critical deficiency results from what has happened to an idea about Presidential assistants, which originated in 1936. In that year, a group of theoretical people, called the President's Commission on Administrative Management, conceived the idea of providing the President with six assistants. The idea was good, but the commission gave it a great handicap.

An academic pundit sold the commission the idea that it would be smart to suggest that these sorely needed assistants should have “a passion for anonymity.” It was alleged that the phrase originated with Sir Maurice Hankey, then secretary to the British Cabinet. Sir Maurice, now Lord Hankey, was a tremendously useful public official, serving as a sort of rubber band pulling together the members of the Cabinet, including the Prime Minister. The Americans who suggested the idea of anonymity completely underestimated Sir Maurice’s importance. He was one of the best known men in England, although he made no speeches and gave no interviews.

Anonymity is impossible, if an official is important. The late Hugh Johnson said, when Congress provided for what came to be known as the “secret six,” that if they did their job, they would be as hard to locate as “the tracks of a herd of elephants in 6 feet of snow.” And if they didn’t do their job, they would be a waste of money.

The Presidential assistants are not only obscure, but mediocre. They are listed in the Congressional directory in fine print, along with bleak routineers and perpetual paper shufflers. On a matter of important policy one would be as likely to consult them as the White House gardener.

According to the latest reports, there are only four such assistants. One is a holdover politician who seems to be His Excellency’s liaison with the left wing—whatever that might be. The others are taken from the sprawling bureaucracy and are run-of-the-mill routine men. They do odd jobs and, considering their past experience, no one would conceive of any of them contributing to the creation of policy.

Anyone who has intelligently observed at first hand the internal operation of the White House knows two things. First, the idea that Cabinet officers are Presidential helpers has been outdated for decades. Their contacts with the President are at Cabinet meetings or at casual appointments. No one can really give the President competent aid unless he is there on the job, seeing from hour to hour what is crossing the President’s desk and vexing his mind.

Moreover, there should be liaison officers to whom Cabinet officers, congressmen and others can tell what they want the President to know. Then such a liaison officer can get the meat of problems over to the President at propitious moments. But such contact people must be big people in their own right. You can’t deliver hot iron in a paper bag.

Assistant to the President suggests a big job. It should attract men and women capable of big policymaking. But such people will not take a desk in the present setup. The whole concept of the six assistants must be changed. The President can do that. Properly staffed, a man of Mr. Truman’s modest capacity can be a notable President. But as things stand, he is headed for disaster.
