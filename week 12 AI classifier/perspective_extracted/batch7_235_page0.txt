**Perspective**

**Freeze the RFC**

**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

On Jan. 22, the Reconstruction
Finance Corp. was fifteen years old.
The RFC will die on June 30, unless
the 80th Congress extends its life. It
is virtually certain that Congress will
do so. The nature of that extension is
one of the most serious issues before
this Congress. For the RFC is one of
the most important public institutions
ever created. In general, it has been
one of the most successful.

When hearings on this
subject begin before the
Senate Banking and Cur-
rency Committee, Jesse
Jones will be an early wit-
ness. Without anticipating
his views here, it may be
assumed that he will point
out the danger which exists
in permitting the great pow-
ers of the RFC to continue.
Presumably, he will suggest
that its authority be overhauled and
that its lending power be frozen until
there is a threat of another credit
emergency.

Mr. Hoover, in calling for the crea-
tion of the RFC in 1932, said that its
purpose was "to furnish during the
period of the depression credits other-
wise unobtainable under existing cir-
cumstances in order to give confidence
to agriculture, industry and labor
against further paralyzing influences."

There is no better illustration than
the RFC of a point made before in
this column: an institution always tends
to outlive the necessity which gave it
birth. The depression passed away.
Credits, "unobtainable" in 1932, are
available on every side. And while
there are some "paralyzing influences"
now, they are not the same as those of
fifteen years ago. There are, even now,
companies in need of help. But there
is no general credit shortage.

The powers of the RFC are terrify-
ing in scope. They include all those
given it to fight the depression, plus
all those invented to further the social-
ization program of the New Deal and,
finally, all those created for fighting
the war. Even in 1933, its powers
were so great that an ardent New
Dealer, then an attorney for the RFC,
said that nearly all the alphabetical
agencies of the New Deal were un-
necessary. Their functions could have
been performed by the RFC.

Congress would never have multi-
plied the powers of the RFC over a
period of twelve years, except for one
substantial fact. That fact was Jesse
Jones. When Jesse became Secretary
of Commerce, Congress let him take
the RFC along. Or, rather, it permitted
Jesse to take the Department of Com-
merce into the RFC, for physically he
remained with the RFC. And when
Jesse resigned, Congress took the RFC
out of the Department of Commerce.

The granting of power because of
confidence in a man was a
great and deserved tribute
to that man. But Jones him-
self is first to say that such
legislation is bad. For the
mighty pen of Jesse is now
held by midget fingers.

Immense power and me-
diocre management invite
abuses. There is always the
danger of pol
important is ti
the President
to hide behind the RFC,
to do things which neithe.
tive nor the Legislative branch
do directly.

These dangers can be avoided and
the great value of the RFC can be
preserved by freezing its lending
power, while maintaining a skeleton
organization to liquidate its loans.
When a credit emergency next ap-
pears, the agency could be reactivated.
But such a revival of the extraordinary
powers should be for no trivial situa-
tion. Perhaps it would be best to pro-
vide that its lending powers could be
restored when and if the President or
Congress proclaims a credit emer-
gency, in the manner in which certain
defense or war powers are brought
into action by the declaration of a war
emergency.

Moreover, the Treasury should
use money received in payment of
RFC loans to retire a sizable part of
the government debt. It should not
be used to pay the running expenses of
the government. Its use for that pur-
pose was not so important while the
government was running a deficit. But
now that we are to have a balanced
budget, an entirely new situation
arises. To indulge in tax reductions
while we are covertly helping to sup-
port ourselves with borrowed money is
indefensible.

No more useful agency was ever
found for fighting a depression. But
unless a depression again threatens,
the RFC should remain in suspended
animation.
