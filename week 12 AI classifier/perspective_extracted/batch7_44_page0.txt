**Lift the Sights**

**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

Two weeks ago in this space I discussed what I called the moral issues in the campaign then drawing to a close. The point was made that in Ohio and in other states, Administration spokesmen and the politicians who claim to represent the political as distinguished from the economic interests of wage earners were wrong in aiming their appeals at the stomachs rather than the minds and hearts of the voters. The whole appeal for the support of the Truman policies was as materialistic as Marx and as cynical as the late Boies Penrose of Pennsylvania.

The election has proved that the voters in many typical states in the main are moved by higher considerations and impulses than are most of their so-called leaders. A specific example of this is the advice repeatedly given to the late President Roosevelt and to President Truman by an exceedingly well-known political leader who enjoyed the deep confidence of both men. He advised that in pitching the tone of Democratic campaigns it should be assumed that approximately 20,000,000 Democrats and the same number of Republicans would stay hitched in any event. The margin for which the snare should be set was, he said, some millions of union members and racial minorities. Aim the appeal at them, he advised, and aim it at their immediate and selfish interests. Past campaigns, including 1950, demonstrate how closely this advice has been followed.

Since this has been the appeal and since it has won so many times, many outside observers have thought that it is unbeatable. These discouraged people have been saying that you can't defeat Santa Claus. Since the number of Federal jobs has mounted to immense proportions they assumed that every government employe and his family would vote for the party in power. And since the government can hand out vast benefits and advantages to wage earners and farmers, they decided that such patronage would always prevail. Also in this particular year, they felt that great apparent prosperity provided a magic shield for the people in office.

Some members of the opposition, moved by these considerations, came to one of two foolish and cowardly conclusions. One of these was to promise more. The other was that the fight was futile and that only when another depression comes can the people in power be ousted. Both of these conclusions overlooked the vast reservoir of intelligence, moral principle, and idealism that resides in the American people.

In surveying what happened at this election, I am not assuming that successful candidates were always themselves the possessors of superior moral values. I am merely attempting to show that voters were certainly not moved to a major degree by the instincts of immediate self-interest. From coast to coast voters of the states rejected the appeals to which I have referred. Neither considerations of jobs nor of material benefits nor of present prosperity prevailed.

In Ohio, the immense appeal of the Labor League, of the Administration henchmen who went out there, and of the Democratic candidate himself was that of material benefits. Ohio has tens of thousands of Federal employes and millions in Federal projects and contracts. Taft and his supporters could offer nothing in material benefits. And yet Taft's tremendous majority came in thousands from the very people who were promised Democratic benefits. In Illinois, the forces behind Lucas had the combined patronage of the Federal, the state, and the immense Chicago governments; yet they fell before the arguments of Dirksen, who had little in the way of organization and nothing that he could promise in the way of patronage.

Even in Missouri, Hennings, the successful candidate, had prevailed over the Federal machine in the primary. People are moved by many impulses other than those with roots in stomachs and pocketbooks. They are endowed with sentiment, idealism, charity, and all the emotions associated with the home, the family, the community, the state, ancestry, tradition, and patriotism. These nonmaterial interests have vast political potentialities. Politicians might well lift their sights.
