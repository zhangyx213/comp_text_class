**Perspective**

**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

**Power, the Great Opiate**

In Cyrano de Bergerac, it will be remembered, the majestic hero made it explicit that the word "nose" should never be mentioned in his presence. It was like that at Chicago last week. Only it was not the nose that was not to be mentioned. It was the third-term tradition. When Representative Ryan tried to bring up the subject for debate and consideration, he was suppressed as promptly as Einstein would have been at the recent meeting of Hitler's Reichstag. When the venerable Carter Glass mentioned Jefferson's counsel against third terms, there were jeers and boos. So this travesty of a representative Democratic Convention figuratively spat upon the name and the principles of Jefferson, the third-term tradition and Senator Glass, one of the most respected figures in the United States of America.

Avoidance of the horrid words "third term" continued throughout Mr. Roosevelt's speech of acceptance. It was complete. The implication left by the speech was that the only hesitation Mr. Roosevelt ever entertained about running again sprang not from the fact that an honored and cherished tradition stood in the way of a third term for one hundred and fifty years, but from his personal plans for private life. The speech sounded like a kindly sermon delivered by an old king who wanted to say that he would carry on a little longer, despite his desire to turn over his burden to his heir. This, apparently, is the light in which Mr. Roosevelt looks upon his situation, and it is a light which leaves American institutions in strange, portentous shadows.

But the speech, while full of regal unction, was nevertheless defensive. And in that defensiveness alone can we detect the realization on Mr. Roosevelt's part that he and his party were attempting to destroy something that millions of people consider infinitely precious in our democracy. This is not to say that Mr. Roosevelt and the "well-integrated group" that ran this convention feel, themselves, that it is precious. They don't. They pooh-poohed Jefferson's hope that a President who would "consent to be a candidate for a third election would be rejected on this demonstration of his ambitious views." They brush aside Jefferson's insistence that for a President to lay down his charge "at a proper period is as much a duty as to have done it faithfully." The only consideration that they seem to have given the third-term tradition has to do with the fact that it may lose them votes. They themselves do not understand the profound logic that is behind it.

In that failure of people in power to understand the logic of a third-term tradition is the complete demonstration of the reason why there should be a third-term tradition. The tradition exists because it is an axiom of politics that the possession of power creates the habit of wielding power, the desire to continue wielding power and an increasing inability on the part of the wielder of power to perceive his own deficiencies, his own mistakes and his own growing taste for power. The makers of the Constitution knew this. Most of their successors knew it. The people of this country have known it. And if they were tempted to forget it, the use of Federal power to affect the primaries in Georgia, Ohio, and elsewhere, and the spectacle of the "rabbit" Democratic Convention of 1940 with its dispirited and acquiescent delegates, its Chicago Superintendent of Sewers crying "We Want Roosevelt" over a mysterious separate loudspeaker system, its duplicate state delegation standards carried by members of Mayor Kelly's local organization—these have served as reminders.

Perhaps it is unfair to expect logic in a communication such as that in which Mr. Roosevelt officially accepted renomination for a third term. Perhaps that was the occasion only for emotion. But one or two of the reasons Roosevelt adduced in support of his decision deserve examination. He quite obviously believes that he is the indispensable head of the nation's defense efforts. The answer to that was made by Mr. Roosevelt himself in 1932, when he declared that there is no indispensable man.

In 1940, he goes on to say that since he has "drafted" men from business to help the defense program, he cannot himself refuse to be "drafted." What an irony it is that men who went to Washington to perform a patriotic and not a partisan service should now be thrown up as breastworks behind which Mr. Roosevelt shoots in justifying his decision to run for office again! The fact of the matter is that it is exceedingly doubtful whether a majority of them really believe that Mr. Roosevelt should be kept in office, after seeing him work at firsthand, or really believe that

tremendous defense job is being directed as efficiently and as wisely as it might be. But to get to the head of the matter, what is a draft? In the first place, a draft is a way of selecting people by some specified method instead of letting them select themselves. It is the opposite of a system under which people volunteer or merely observe the fiction of being chosen. Second, a draft involves the element of choice on the basis of fitness for the immediate task in hand.

If Mr. Roosevelt, then, was authentically drafted, the issue he must put to the voters becomes the issue whether he should be reelected because he is the best available person for the job in hand. It ceases to be an issue of what he has done in the past. If this is a draft, he and his political associates must realize that the people are selecting someone to do a job after January 1941; they are not selecting a man because of something that he did in 1933. So they will have to forgo, in this campaign, the recapitulations of glories past and victories won. Rehashes will be irrelevant if the draft is really a draft.

There remains the question whether the draft is a draft—the question of how much self-selection, how much "Coax me" entered into the proceedings. And that inevitably recalls the blighting of other men's candidacies within the party until anything except a "draft" was all but impossible; the long, long acquiescence in the third-term maneuvers of close associates; their attempt, balked by Jim Farley, to dispense with nominations and a roll call and contrive the semblance of a nomination by acclamation; and the acceptance of the shocking alliance between the so-called "idealists" and the Hagues, Kellys and Guffeys.

The President's poignant declaration that he had no purpose or desire to continue to be President was surely the crowning touch. It sounded like nothing so much as his comment in January 1932 that he did not see why any man would want to be President—a comment made at the very moment that Jim Farley was traveling all over the country lining up the votes of the delegates. I hope that no supporter of Mr. Roosevelt will be so affected by Mr. Roosevelt's statements about Mr. Roosevelt's personal sacrifices that he will decide to vote against Mr. Roosevelt in order to confer upon him the joys of private life. I am afraid that such a person would miss Mr. Roosevelt's point. Mr. Roosevelt does not say that he dislikes his job. There is good reason to believe that he loves it.
