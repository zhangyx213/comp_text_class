**PERSPECTIVE**

**EAST OF SUEZ**

**BY RAYMOND MOLEY**

We Americans, with few exceptions, have scarcely thought of the Indian Ocean since we studied geography in our school days. But now it might be well for all of us to examine a map of that great expanse, to count the 37 nations that it touches and especially note the two channels that connect it with the rest of the world, Suez and the Red Sea at the west and the Strait of Malacca at the east. And while the map is before us, observe that Southeast Asia is a peninsula at the tip of which is South Vietnam. That reveals more about the reason why the United States must make sure that Communism cannot be allowed to occupy that strategic point than all the Senate hearings and debate and most of what the President has said.

For the grim truth that leaps forth from that map is that Communist domination of the tip of that peninsula, with land-based air power and havens for submarines, could assure control of the Strait of Malacca. That, in war or cold war, would frustrate access not only to Australia and India but to most of the countries washed by the Indian Ocean.

**THE BRITISH WITHDRAWAL**

An official government publication is entitled "The New Four Ocean Challenge." It makes the valid point that our maritime responsibility must now encompass not only the Atlantic and Pacific but the Arctic and the Afro-Asian oceans. The nuclear-powered submarine and the Polaris missile have unlocked the Arctic to naval power. The Afro-Asian expanse has been consigned to our concern by the liquidation of the British Empire and the decline of British sea power. The British Government has recently announced its plan to liquidate its great base at Aden and to substitute land-based planes for aircraft carriers. This leaves a power vacuum in the vast expanse east of Suez which the British expect us to fill. And we must accept that burden or Communism from China and the growing sea power of Soviet Russia will. The Indian Ocean cannot be dominated alone by the land-based aircraft of the British.

Freedom of the seas is a relative term. It must be maintained by the nation that has the military power to assure it. We can be sure that the countries that border on the Indian Ocean would not be secure if they looked out upon waters dominated by Communist power.

But at this time we have no fleet to patrol that area of sea water. Our force there is only two destroyers and one seaplane tender. Therefore, the United States must depend upon mobility in shifting parts of our fleet through the Strait of Malacca from the Pacific. With access closed, that could not be assured. That access is now as important to us and the free world as are the Caribbean and the Panama Canal.

**SOVIET SEA POWER**

For Soviet Russia is rapidly building its naval power. It is now second only to us on the sea. It has more than 400 submarines, 25 of which are nuclear-powered and equipped with missiles, as well as many other modern warships. It already has that other component of sea power, a vast merchant fleet.

For the time being, the Soviet's cold wet war consists in squeezing the spots of interocean passage. The Cuban episode of 1962 should be fresh in our minds. There is the pattern of Communist nourishment of disorder and movement of military power into the proximity of the narrow sea passages, as at Panama and Suez. There are Soviet attempts now to establish a base in North Africa to dominate the Strait of Gibraltar. The Soviet support of North Vietnam is part of the same strategy.

With maritime mobility we may not need permanent bases in Vietnam. Ambassador Goldberg has assured the U.N. that bases there are not a part of our plan.

All this may be alarming to Americans still possessed by a landlocked mentality, to quasi-statesmen like Fulbright and Morse who believe a negotiating table to be the end-all of trouble. Or to the cunning calculations of Robert Kennedy, who is willing to make political capital of the ignorance of the President's critics. Those misguided people who parade with the slogan "get out of Vietnam" would roll back 70 years of American history.
