**School Fables and Facts II**
by Raymond Moley

A CENTRAL point in the Rockefeller
Brothers Fund report on educa-
tion says that "All of the problems of
the schools lead us back sooner or
later to one basic problem—financing.
It is a problem with which we cannot
afford to cope halfheartedly."

Elsewhere the report uses thou-
sands of words to show that the
"central problem" is that those pro-
fessionals who plan and build our
schools, select and train the teachers,
and determine what goes into the
teaching content have grossly misused
the resources which they already
have. Yet it does not specifically put
the finger on those responsible.
Thus it is utterly self-contradictory
and therefore meaningless.

Lord Melbourne was quoted as say-
ing at a Cabinet meeting over which
he presided: "Now is it to lower the
price of corn, or isn't it? It is not much
matter what we say, we must all say
the same."

The chairman of the panel or large
committee which presumably wrote
the summary of the report, Dr. John
W. Gardner, president of the
Carnegie Foundation, in a television
interview pointed out that there were
wide differences of opinion within the
committee as to the "basic problem."
Hence, as is the case of all reports
written by a committee when the
members are not agreed on anything
vital, they agreed upon nothing.

**WHAT WE SPEND**

It is like a political platform, something
for everybody. This brings to
mind that this report and others of
the Rockefeller Brothers Fund have
been nicely synchronized, and thus
materially help Brother Nelson's quest
for the governorship of New York.

This report was thunderously ac-
claimed by some elements of the
press. All hail the names of Rockefeller
and Carnegie.

Now let us look at the assertion
that money is the essential need. A
conclusive denial is Roger Freeman's
massive array of facts—for the most
part taken from official government
sources—in his book, "School Needs
in the Decade Ahead" (reviewed in
this space last week).

Public education absorbs the largest
government expenditures except for
national defense and almost as much
as for highways, natural resources,
and veterans combined. This is only
in part because of larger school en-
rollment. The cost per student since
1890 has increased tenfold in constant
dollars. In that time school enrollment
has increased threefold and prices
threefold; but expenditures for edu-
cation, 100-fold.

It is wholly unwarranted to assume,
as the Rockefeller report does, that
enrollment must increase in the
twelve years ahead as it has in the
past. There have been spectacular in-
creases in enrollment for periods, but
a lower level has always followed.
Freeman estimates on the basis of
census reports that the increase will
continue until 1961 and then taper
off. The Rockefeller report assumes a
greater increase in the next three
years than is justified for twelve years.

**WHAT WE GET**

The major increase in expenditures
has been caused by three factors:
(a) Inefficient use of teachers' time
and of school plant; (b) excessive
cost of construction by the addition of
vastly excessive accessories for com-
munity use, not for teaching children,
and (c) the dilution of the
curriculum by such courses as marriage
and family relationships, grooming,
junior homemaking for boys,
beauty care, date behavior, stage-
craft, square dancing, and fly-casting.
These are not in addition to basic
subjects, but are in considerable part
instead of them.

Essentially, we are educating children
for off-hour matters rather than
in the fundamentals. Those fundamentals
should be (a) to train children
to think and (b) to respect and
observe moral principles. Neither is
helped by the sort of thing I have
mentioned. If leisure-hour matters are
to be taught, and if they are carefully
determined and planned to meet a
genuine need, they should be offered
in off-school hours, as an addition to
the substance of a decent education
in at-school hours.

Our educational institutions are
softening up a generation of children
who, in the face of the hard work and
determination of Communist countries,
should be the hope of the world.
