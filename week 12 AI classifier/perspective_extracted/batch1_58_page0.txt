**PERSPECTIVE**

**BELOW HELL'S CANYON**

BY RAYMOND MOLEY

A decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia on March 24 reminds us of a dispute between the public and private power interests in the Northwest similar to the celebrated Hell's Canyon controversy in the 1950s. In the present case, a group of Washington State public utility districts (PUD's) and the Interior Department have, like veritable dogs in the manger, only succeeded in delaying for more than ten years a development not only highly beneficial to the region but that would provide rich revenues for the local, state and Federal governments. This case, while equally important, may not attract the nationwide attention that was accorded Hell's Canyon. But it deserves to be clearly understood by the nation's taxpayers as an example of the disregard of the public interest by those who are determined to build a vast publicly owned and operated electric-power monopoly.

The court approved the building of a massive hydroelectric dam on the Snake River about 100 miles north of (or below) Hell's Canyon by the Pacific Northwest Power Co.

**THE BOUNTIFUL SNAKE**

The Snake River rivals the Columbia as a source of electric power. In 1951, when the earlier dispute arose, I wrote this about the remarkable Snake River:

"The Snake River, despite its sinister name, is the best-behaved domestic servant in the nation. It is also one of the most useful. It rises in Yellowstone Park and enters Idaho at an altitude of more than 6,000 feet and winds through that state for 700 miles. Then it reaches the border of Oregon and finally leaves Idaho at an altitude of 600 feet. That decline of more than a mile provides a source of vast water power and irrigation. The Snake's volume of water is copious, steady and continuous. The river stays at all times in its narrow, sometimes deep channel and hence manifests none of the capricious, destructive habits of the Mississippi, the Missouri, and the Columbia. It provides fertility, power and glory for its master, Idaho. The Snake and its tributaries are dammed and tapped again and again. Without it, southern


Idaho would be a series of brown hills and desert valleys. With it, southern Idaho is a rich, prosperous home for a sturdy, industrious, conservative population."

When the river reaches the border of Oregon it flows for nearly 300 miles through a desert canyon, the walls of which are at some points higher than those of the Grand Canyon of the Colorado. Thus it provides ideal sites for power-producing dams. No beauty spots are destroyed, because the canyon is a brown waste. There is no problem of inundating productive farm or industrial land. Flood control is a minor consideration. And dams can rise to great heights because of the fall of the river.

**THE NEZ PERCE PROPOSAL**

The long dispute over the development of Hell's Canyon was between the Interior Department along with Senator Morse and the public-power promoters in the region on the one hand, and the Idaho Power Co. on the other. The Interior Department wanted to build a very high dam with Federal money; the Idaho company proposed three lower dams. The Eisenhower Administration through Interior Secretary McKay withdrew the Federal government's opposition, and the Federal Power Commission issued a license to the Idaho Power Co. The dams were built and are operating-and paying taxes to the local, state and Federal governments.

During that dispute one of the arguments was that private development would foreclose the "last of the nation's fine sites" for a great hydro dam. This was false, because there were other sites equally usable on the Snake channel below.

One of those sites was called Nez Perce, about 100 miles down the river from Hell's Canyon. The Interior Department bureaucrats had been dreaming about this site for years. Thus a Federal dam at Nez Perce was one of the proposals before the Federal Power Commission. Another was an application from a group of public-utility districts in the state of Washington. A third was a proposal of the Pacific Northwest Power Co. to build at another site. In another piece I shall consider this new dispute.
