**Perspective**

**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

**Economy**

The simplest way to try to understand the President's financial plans for 1940 is to recognize, at the outset, that they are an attempt to blend two entirely contradictory theories of government financing. The first of these holds that the business cycle can be controlled by government spending or lack of spending. The second theory, which is the traditional American theory, holds that expenses of government are necessary but undesirable, and that the lower they can be kept the better off the nation will be.

During the past seven years President Roosevelt has been pulled and hauled by the advocates of both schools of thought. At times he has shown a very strong belief in financial orthodoxy. At others, he has shifted far over to the spending theory in an effort to put the best possible face on difficult political situations. Certainly that was his mood last summer, when he proposed his ill-fated spend-lend program. It was his mood in April of 1938. It must have been his mood when he took as one of his six confidential advisers Dr. Lauchlin Currie, one of the most ardent advocates of spending.

But the 1940 budget message is something else again. And because it comes trailing faint intimations of financial orthodoxy, it has shocked and grieved, beyond measure, the intra-Administration group of ardent spenders.

Those in office are muttering their dissent behind closed doors. Spend-lend Congressmen and newspaper commentators of that persuasion make no bones of their distress. They "talk of graves, of worms and epitaphs, make dust their paper and with rainy eyes write sorrow on the bosom of the earth."

But if the spend-lend boys would only leave off their lamentations for a moment they might see much to comfort them. The President affirms once more that the depression starting in late 1937 was caused in part, at least, by his own rigorous attempts to balance the budget. He claims that the recession was checked by the spending he recommended. There are other passages in the message to indicate that his faith in spending still lives.

His budget itself shows little disposition to weed out those irrelevant and extraneous "emergency" agencies whose only justification is political. Those points at which the deepest cuts are made are carefully poulticed with language that will make it easy for Congress, with or without his recommendation, to increase appropriations. With reference to relief, for example, the President says: "If conditions fail to meet our hopes additional funds may be necessary. I may, therefore, submit revised estimates later in the session."

As to the debt limit, it is apparent only that he intends to avoid a request that it be raised. By the use of many "ifs," he heaves this hot potato into the hands of Congress. His message makes it plain that all his figures are contingent upon three separate factors—all of which are highly dubious (see pages 50 and 54).

When the budgetary system was devised some twenty years ago, the idea was that it would present as clearly as possible the necessary—and only the necessary—expenditures of the Federal government and recommend adequate taxes to cover these expenditures. The executive budget was, in short, to be a complete and detailed plan for the activities of the government. Congress was to tamper with it only after the most careful consideration. Such was the theory of the system as set up by General Dawes in the first year of the budget.

But either the fundamental theory has proved to be unworkable, or the President has deliberately, because he is unwilling to assume the responsibility himself, thrown the making of the budget back into Congress. In any case, we may well be going back where we were a quarter of a century ago—with the possibility of all the old evils of Congressional log-rolling and extravagance that marked that period.

If we are, it would be unfair to place the entire blame upon the President. It may be that an executive budget, as contemplated by those who created it twenty years ago, cannot be operated in the face of practical considerations, the most important of which is the difficulty of forecasting business conditions. Before returns are all in, one cannot tell absolutely how much money can be raised by taxes. If business turns out to be worse than has been expected, there will be smaller profits and smaller returns from taxation. That always was an element of uncertainty capable of throwing the budget out a few hundred million dollars one way or the other. But when we add to this uncertainty another—which we automatically do when we subscribe to the theory that we will prime the pump whenever the business cycle turns down—we have created a degree of contingency that comes close to destroying any possibility of an executive budget. And that, it appears, is where we stand as 1940 begins.


**Murphy and Jackson**

A fair knowledge of Frank Murphy's record as a judge of the Recorder's Court in Detroit encourages the belief that, as Justice of the Supreme Court, he will do much better than some of his critics predict.

When Murphy was elected to the Recorder's Court, his colorful personality and his war record—factors which should not weigh heavily in the selection of judges—were inordinately stressed. Friends of the court were perturbed about what he might do with the job. There were fears that he might institute drastic and possibly unsound reforms. But as judge he showed an extraordinary capacity to learn. He was not only a humane judge—everyone expected that of him—but an efficient and highly intelligent one. The same capacity for growth marked his career as Mayor of Detroit and as Governor of the Philippines. It can conservatively be said that he has always done better than all except his warmest friends ever expect him to do.

As a Supreme Court Justice, Frank Murphy will, in general, show sympathy for the legislation of the past seven years. But he will be watchful of the rights of minorities as against bureaucratic oppression. And he can be counted upon to resist the efforts of the more fervid reformers on the Court to tell him what to think.

I wish that the new Attorney General could be expected to show equal capacity for growth. Many who expected great things of the bright young Robert Jackson were profoundly disappointed by his extravagant speeches two years ago. Others were distinctly shocked when Wendell Willkie so thoroughly shellacked him in debate. Jackson's greatest shortcomings seem to be his willingness to accept uncritically many of the specious economic ideas which are so common in Washington under this dispensation and his unflagging belief that he can find, in the hollow phrases of uplift, the materials for sound economic and social progress.

I hope I am wrong in my doubt that he will be more than a run-of-the-mill Attorney General. But those who expect him to do distinguished work in that office will be excellently advised if they discourage some of the talk that we are now beginning to hear about Jackson as a candidate for President or Vice President. Such nonsense is good neither for him nor for anyone else.
