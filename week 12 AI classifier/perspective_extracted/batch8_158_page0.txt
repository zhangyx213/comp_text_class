**France in Revolution**

I

If the word at the head of this page has any significance it means that the ability to appraise a contemporary event of stupendous size requires a basis of judgment set far back from the contemporary scene. In this sense, France's reaction to revolution cannot be judged apart from the memories and fears that France inherited from former revolutions, especially from its greatest—the revolution that began in 1789. We, in the United States, do not inherit those memories and fears because, by comparison with France's storm of blood and disorder, our own revolution was an almost tranquil transfer of sovereignty. In making judgments, we depend, as we must, upon the most permanently important accounts of contemporaries. They warrant rereading now, particularly those of them that bear upon the relation of that great upheaval to our own institutions and our own methods of preserving orderly liberty.

Viewed from this standpoint, Edmund Burke's "Reflections Upon the Revolution in France" is to an American reader the most significant. It opens a flood of light upon the present ordeal of France, clouded over as it is by censorship, prejudice and confusion. More important, it reveals the vast distinction between revolutionary France and the liberal but more enduring constitutional liberty of England which is now so gravely threatened.

It has long been the habit of academic slickers who profess to teach our youngsters history and economics to pass sneeringly over this last great effort of Burke to interpret English liberty. Burke's "Reflections" was, say they, the product of an old liberal turned conservative. It is not, they add, consistent with the speeches of the younger Burke who defended the rights of the American colonies against the government of George III. But I suspect that either these critics of Burke have not read what he said about the French Revolution or they have misunderstood what he said. Burke defended the Americans because he asserted—vainly, as it happened—that Americans must have an equal share in the inheritance of English constitutional rights. He condemned the French Revolution because, in its very nature, it was the enemy, the antithesis, the negation of those rights that he felt the English had denied the Americans. History has proved that he was right in both cases.

Burke's "Reflections" was written in the form of a letter, a bulky one, running well


NEWSWEEK AUGUST 19, 1940

over one hundred thousand words. It was addressed to "a very young gentleman in Paris" who had corresponded with Burke and had asked his opinion of the revolution. It was finished in 1790, well before the worst horrors of the Terror had broken out—written in the period when well-meaning clowns and silly theorists were preparing the way for the murderers who were to come. Burke's discourse was chiefly intended as a warning to Englishmen against the pro-revolutionary crackpots in England who urged the abandonment of traditional methods of seeking freedom by the forms, at least, of English law. It became England's intellectual defense against the imbecilities and horrors of revolution.

France, said Burke, had made a "fond election of evil" under the spell of "delusive plausibilities" and had drifted into a state of affairs which he described in a long, eloquent sentence: "Laws overturned," he said; "tribunals subverted; industry without vigor; commerce expiring; the revenue unpaid, yet the people impoverished; a church pillaged, and a state not relieved; civil and military anarchy made the constitution of the kingdom; everything human and divine sacrificed to the idol of public credit, and national bankruptcy the consequence; and, to crown all, the paper securities of new, precarious, tottering power, the discredited paper securities of impoverished fraud and beggared rapine, held out as a currency for the support of an empire, in lieu of the two great recognized species that represent the lasting, conventional credit of mankind, which disappeared and hid themselves in the earth from whence they came, when the principle of property, whose creatures and representatives they are, was systematically subverted." Under this regime, Burke concluded, "France has bought poverty with crime." Its revolution was "the offspring of cold hearts and muddy understanding."

Describing all this, he reminded England of the danger she faced in words that Americans might well ponder in 1940: "Whenever our neighbor's house is on fire, it cannot be amiss for the engines to play a little on our own. Better to be despised for too anxious apprehensions than ruined by too confident a security."

With incisive logic, Burke then proceeded to take apart the jerry-built reforms the pedants in France had established—their flabby provisions for executive power, their unjust system of law and their crazy currency. He gave special attention to their new system of representation in which arbitrary geographic measurements were substituted for natural relationships based upon geographical and economic community of interest. Ironically he asked whether "the constitution of a republic be a problem in arithmetic." The question, in its essence, is still a valid one. But the voice of reason was not heard amidst the din of a regime which ironically and falsely instituted a worship of reason in the place of a worship of God. As Burke predicted, the revolution lurched ahead into a welter of more and more blood, more and more mad theorizing, until, after unbelievable destruction of values, dictatorship finally arose to the cheers of the same deluded masses that had hailed the revolution. Thus the lurid cycle of change.

We ought to remember something of this charitably when we ask ourselves how, in the name of heaven, the French could have accepted the present Pétain government. There are very ugly rumors about that government—open charges that it is a puppet government, whispers that it is a traitor government, stories of seemingly inexcusable political persecution, such as the current trials of Daladier, Blum and Reynaud. Yet it is too soon for blanket condemnation. We do not yet have enough facts. We do not yet know enough to say more, honestly, than that if there are selfish and villainous people participating in the new regime, there are doubtless patriots too. Men like Pétain and Weygand, know the meaning of the traditional revolutionary cycle. They have reason to fear it greatly. Pétain himself lived through the disorder of the '70s. Clemenceau had lived through it too, and shrewd observers declare that, in 1919, his fear of Communism dominated his entire attitude toward the peace.

There must be some members of the new regime who sincerely believe that Communism differs from the bloody insanity of the Terror of 1793 only in externals of its language; who think that latent in France, before and after this war, has been the same ruthless and unholy combination of brutality and mouthed theory against which Burke warned the English.

The test of the Pétain government will be whether, somehow, it can hold together the values of civilized France until a better government can be established. And foremost among those values is religious tolerance. If the Pétain government permits this to be lost, it will have lost much of the poignant sympathy thinking Americans now have for France. But if and when we hear that intolerance has set in, let us be sure that our sources of information are trustworthy—that they are not the same sources that would have sacrificed what was democratic in France to a Communist ideology.
