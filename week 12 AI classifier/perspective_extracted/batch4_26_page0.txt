**Business and Politics**

by Raymond Moley

FOREMOST among the topics head-
lined at the recent sessions of the
committees of the Chamber of Com-
merce of the United States in Wash-
ington was the growing political
responsibility of businessmen and cor-
porations in political activity. This also
characterized the emphasis in many
other trade-association meetings in re-
cent months. In fact, the question of
what businessmen can, may, and
should do in the political life of their
communities is the hottest subject in
the business world. This is a long-
delayed but promising awakening.
However, outside the business
world, there is still a great misappre-
hension about the considered conclu-
sions of those business leaders who
have decided that they must play a
larger part in the political affairs of
the nation. This lack of understanding
concerning such plans is especially
notable in some newspapers and
magazines generally sympathetic with
business and conservative in policy.

**NOT ANTI-LABOR**

These are some of the major con-
clusions of the most advanced think-
ing of the business world:

First, it is realized that whatever
businessmen do in politics and public
affairs must not be anti-labor. Their
concern must be positive, not nega-
tive. It is realized that neither by law
nor public opinion can the very effec-
tive operations of the unions in politics
be stopped or curbed. The tremen-
dous help given by the unions to the
Democratic-liberal cause in the No-
vember election cannot be attributed
to the violation of laws and/or to the
evils revealed by the McClellan com-
mittee. The unions and their members
have won a very great majority of
their victories by doing exactly what
all public-spirited citizens should do
-be they butchers, bakers, candle-
stick makers, corporation executives,
lawyers, or labor leaders. They have
gotten sympathetic people interested
in politics, have gotten their neighbors
registered and to the polls by hard,
skillful, efficient work.

Businessmen who have thought the
thing through have also reached the
conclusion that basic political activity
must be carried on by individual citi-
zens working at the community levels,


where the votes are cast and repre-
sentatives to Congress and the State
Legislatures are elected.

They also know that it would
merely precipitate a class battle if this
activity were undertaken by business,
as such. They want no business party
or movement. They merely want in-
dependent businessmen and corpora-
tion employees at all levels to do their
civic duty in their communities.

**THE CORPORATION'S ROLE**

They also recognize a clear distinc-
tion between what the corporation
should do and what the individual
member of a community should do.
So far as the top management of the
corporation is concerned, it should
limit itself to these activities:

1-It should disseminate informa-
tion to all members of its corporate
body-management, workers in and
out of unions, dealers, stockholders,
and also customers-concerning the
methods and activities by which the
individual can exercise influence in
politics and civic affairs in the com-
munity where he lives.

2-It should remove all restrictions,
now unfortunately present in some
corporations, upon the political and
civic activities of its employees. There
should be no denial of promotion, sen-
iority, or advantage to those who
spend time in public affairs. Neither
should it compel such activity.

3-It should make known, by the
written word and otherwise, to all
upon whom corporate life depends,
including employees, dealers, stock-
holders, customers, and the public
generally, what their interests are in
current legislation and policies before
their government.

Beyond this, the corporation should
not go and, so far as I know, no in-
telligent corporation executive, inter-
ested in politics intends to go.

At the community level the rule is
do-it-yourself, either within one of the
parties or otherwise. An excellent de-
tailed manual of suggestions concerning
activity at that level was recently
published by the Chamber of Com-
merce U.S.A. But the implementation
of activity is up to the citizen in his
community. There is no mystery about
all this. It is simply the exercise of
good, vital citizenship.
