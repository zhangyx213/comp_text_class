The Ford Revolution
by Raymond Moley

THE decisions of the Ford interests
to sell a considerable amount of
the Ford stock held by the Ford
Foundation, and the half-billion-dollar
grant to colleges, universities, hospitals, and medical schools represent immense and wholesome shifts in policy.
The sale of the stock is a long step toward separating the company from the foundation. This relieves the foundation from any suspicion that it is furthering a commercial interest, and it relieves the company of responsibility for what might be unpopular policies of the foundation. It also will provide hundreds of thousands of small owners who may by their surveillance protect the public interest from the dangers always inherent in great power vested in so few hands.
The grant to the medical schools and hospitals represents a very great break from the original plans for the foundation. It is a belated admission that the war against disease is far from victory.
The program of the foundation was originally created in 1948-1950 by a "study committee" composed of a lawyer, W. Rowan Gaither Jr., now president of the foundation; a doctor; a school administrator; and five professors. None of these were experienced in foundation work. It could hardly be a coincidence that the five "areas" which they recommended for the foundation correspond to a degree to the academic departments in which the professors had been teaching.
The plan substantially ruled out medical research, public health, and natural science on the vague ground that "progress toward democratic goals are today social rather than physical." "Democratic goals" are nowhere defined.
Vagueness in purpose proved to be the very breath of life to Paul Hoffman and Robert M. Hutchins, who scattered Ford grants, large and small, in all directions except those proscribed by the plan. This was in complete disregard for the wisdom of the truly great men who had directed the earlier destinies of the Carnegie and Rockefeller foundationsâ€”men like Frederick T. Gates and Abraham Flexner, who warned against what Gates called "scatteration." Flexner, the venerable survivor of a great philanthropic tradition, issued his most recent warning against small grants as late as 1952 in his wise little book, "Funds and Foundations."
The inevitable product of "scatteration" (which continued even after Hoffman and Hutchins were themselves scattered in 1953) was a big and expensive overhead staff of busy people to think up or sort out innumerable projects, to be bestowed with plenty of money upon specially created agencies or upon professors hard pressed to live on their academic salaries. Many wise college administrators deplored this trend, which they called "projectitis."
They realized, however, that their younger teachers to whom they were unable to pay fair salaries would more and more have to wangle some sort of foundation grant to keep the pot boiling at home and to produce the written work essential for promotion.
Preoccupation with these projects, undertaken in many, many cases not because of their intellectual inclination but because of their poverty, would mean that the primary job of classroom teaching would suffer.
More serious than this is the fact that the obsession of the Ford Foundation with the social and "behavioral" sciences meant that teachers of philosophy, literature, and other liberal arts were left out in the cold.
The Ford grant to colleges and universities, for the most part to raise salaries, should be the beginning of a correction of these defects in present policies. With better salaries, teachers will be more able to decide for themselves what course their scholarship or research will take.

FINALLY, this policy of grants to colleges and universities directly and without project strings will introduce an element of local supervision and watchfulness by responsible boards of trustees and faculties. Intimate responsibility for the expenditure of such large sums cannot and should not rest with any one board, however distinguished, and with any one bureaucracy, however carefully chosen.
