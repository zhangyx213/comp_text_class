**Two Great Liberals**

by Raymond Moley

HERBERT HOOVER'S "The Ordeal of
Woodrow Wilson"* is a part of a
massive labor over the past fourteen
years, examining and directing the ex-
amination of millions of documents re-
lating to famine relief. Out of that
labor has come this reappraisal of Mr.
Wilson-a work of admiration, re-
spect, affection, and compassion.
Its significance is enhanced by the
fact that the author, who by circum-
stances and tradition was of another
political party, shares the same deep
ideals of constitutional government, of
international interdependence and re-
sponsibility, and of profound human-
itarian instincts. This reveals how
alike then were the deep roots of the
two political parties. The two Presi-
dents were liberals in the traditional,
hallowed meaning of that word-a
word now larcenously appropriated
by American collectivists.
Mr. Hoover was incomparably pre-
pared to portray the incredible or-
deal through which Mr. Wilson was
fated to pass on his way to bitter
frustration, defeat, and death. For
Herbert Hoover worked abroad many
years, knew foreign problems as an
expert, and understood them not as a
tourist or a diplomat, but as a partici-
pant "in their daily life and work."
He knew, as Mr. Wilson did not, the
racial, national, and economic hatreds
and rivalries born of centuries of con-
quest, injustice, and depression. He
realistically appraised how deeply in
Europe were imbedded selfishness,
cruelty, and materialism-the original
sins of mankind.

**THE INCREDIBLE BURDEN**

He served in a special capacity
close to the war President and was
able to see those vicious forces coil
about Mr. Wilson's idealistic efforts
and paralyze the intentions and ob-
jectives of "the only nation since the
Crusades to fight other people's bat-
tles at her own gigantic loss."
Mr. Wilson's terrible burdens in-
cluded the tremendous administrative
task that inevitably rests upon a Presi-
dent. There were also problems with
the twenty nations which had de-
clared their independence and set up
governments. Communist Russia, then


as now, was a malign force. Millions of
starving people had to be fed; and
cruel moves by France and Britain to
starve Germany finally had to be re-
solved by the strength of the Presi-
dent alone. There was the agonizing
effort to compel England, France, and
Italy to accept the League of Nations,
despite the cynicism and deceit of
Lloyd George, Clemenceau, and
Orlando. Finally, there was the effort
to mobilize public opinion in the
United States against partisan attacks.
Any one of these problems would
have burdened a man to the utmost.
Collectively, they were an ordeal
through which perhaps no other
statesman has ever passed.
Mr. Wilson had to meet these prob-
lems in ignorance of all but four of
seven secret treaties made by the
major allies. These not only would
have nullified many of the "Fourteen
Points and the subsequent addresses"
of Mr. Wilson which the allies had
adopted, but would have carved up
Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.

**THE LASTING FRUITS**

Throughout this account there
looms up the fine figure of Mr. Hoover
himself-the fighter for humanitarian
causes who deeply felt the suffering
of a war-torn population, the adminis-
trative genius who brought efficiency
to relief, the wise adviser and loyal
servant of his chief.
Could this ordeal and frustration
have been different, had Mr. Wilson
been more compromising, more will-
ing to indulge in political expediency,
more tolerant of the opinions of oth-
ers? Who can tell how much Mr.
Wilson could have conceded without
losing all?
Mr. Hoover points out that Mr.
Wilson's efforts and sacrifice did
spread his ideals over the world,
where they still ferment in the growth
of free institutions. There will always
remain in the memory of men the fact
that two-score nations threw off their
yokes. And the memory of men will
cherish the fact that the United States
carried on the greatest battle ever
conducted, unselfishly, against famine
and pestilence. No one has portrayed
these lasting fruits of Mr. Wilson's
ordeal as has Herbert Hoover in this
dedicated book.
