**PERSPECTIVE**

**The GOP's Young Men**

*by Raymond Moley*

I WONDER if you have noticed that there are fewer and fewer references these days to the GOP "Old Guard"? This is because it is now difficult to make people believe that the Republican Party is a worm-eaten antique when so many of its active and most influential leaders have not reached threescore. This accent on youth is especially notable in the House of Representatives, the port of entry and training ground for party leadership. Witness Messrs. Kennedy and Nixon, who entered that chamber in 1947 at the ages of 29 and 34 respectively.

This predominance of youth was brought home to me forcefully when I was the guest speaker at the breakfast meetings of two groups of Republican House members this summer. One, called the 87th Club, is composed of members elected in 1960. The other, called the S.O.S. Club, is made up of members elected in the 1950s. The 50 members of these groups alone have an average age in the middle 40s. Some of them are in their 30s.

The younger Republican members of the House have a remarkable habit of working together. They meet together and develop joint policies on legislation. They specialize. One will concentrate on military affairs, another on the budget, another on taxes, still others on welfare policies, foreign trade, international affairs, etc. They issue interesting and informative policy papers which collectively could constitute a party platform, strong in specifics and marked by constructive alternatives to the policies of the Administration and the Democratic leadership.

**DOING THEIR HOMEWORK**

An examination of these papers, together with the speeches of their authors on the floor, shows that they are not mere criticism of the Democratic opposition. These members have viable and attractive plans for meeting public problems. They are preparing the way for the time when the country will entrust leadership to a majority of their own party.

Their letters to their constituents, generally issued weekly, and which I receive in considerable numbers, are meaty and highly informative. In short, these men are doing their homework well. And also they are quite aware of political realities, which means that in forthcoming elections they will be hard to beat.

In their voting record on vital issues, under the leadership of the sage and experienced Minority Leader Charles Halleck, they have shown remarkable cohesion.

The Congressional Record mirrors this new intellectual vigor. Time was when the House section of that daily parliamentary journal deserved little more than a glance from its constant readers. It was full of routine affairs. The real business of the House was carried on in committees. Now, however, there are meaningful debates and speeches which inform and impress their hearers and readers. Democratic sponsors of Administration measures are compelled by searching questions to come to the nub of things.

**THE PARTY'S FUTURE**

This improvement in the quality of the House is the more notable because of the quite apparent decline in the character and quality of Senate proceedings. There, the Record is marred by the effusions of demagogues and windbags. A close reader of the Record said recently that "the House Record used to be the throw-away. Now it is the Senate part."

Capable Republican congressmen are scattered among the major committees of the House. In some cases they work well with the veteran Democratic chairmen. When they disagree with the majority, their minority reports are well worth reading.

The future of the Republican Party is there among the younger members of the House. There is the reserve from which will come the senators and governors—maybe Presidents—of the future. These young men are the assurance that the policies of the Republican Party will be neither a limp imitation of the "liberalism" of the Democrats nor mere opposition and criticism. Such policies will generate public support because they will be the assurance of progress through the framework of tested principles—progress that is "never wholly new . . . never wholly obsolete."
