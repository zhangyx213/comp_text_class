**Perspective**

'A Seamless Web'

Here in the United States, we
have what highbrows call a high standard
of living. Simply stated, that means that
we want a lot of things and that more people
get a lot of things than they do anywhere
else. In some degree, that is because
we are a big country, a rich country, with
vast natural resources. But Russia and
China have great natural resources too.
We have achieved the miracle of our
standard of life because of our unique economic
system—the most powerful, the
most free, the most resourceful and the
most complex that the world has seen.

This system that we have created in the
United States is something new. Like a
watch, it cannot be explained by adding
up its parts. It does not begin to make
sense until you understand the intricate
relations of those parts.

True, there are things that we call production
and consumption, labor, management,
investment, promotion, selling and
advertising. But these are not separable
things. They are parts of a “seamless web.”

What gives the whole process a
voice, a common currency of ideas, a common
consciousness of needs and potential
needs, a forum for presenting the results
of the efforts to satisfy needs, is the economic
activity which we call advertising.
More than any other single factor, it is
this that is the embodiment of the dynamic
character of our economic system—
the quality that makes it grow because it
creates new demands at the same moment
that it produces the goods to satisfy
them.

If there were no self-starter, we should
not mind cranking our car. If there were
no car, we should be content with old Dob-
bin. But as we know more, we want more.
And the more we want, the more people
think up for us. Wants depend upon
knowledge. And knowledge comes from
what we feel, see and hear. To help us see,
feel and hear is the function of advertising.
Its purpose, in economic terms, is to enlarge
the circle of shared enjoyment, to
widen the horizon of taste, to make possible
the bringing of new things from the
research laboratory and their addition to
the life of the remote consumer. In short,
advertising supplies vital nerve cells in this
economic process of ours.

A manufacturer spends money on advertising
a new product long before he makes
any money on that product. He advertises
to build what is technically called public
acceptance for the product. In less technical
language, this means public knowledge
that the product exists. The money
spent for this purpose, the producer properly
regards as part of the cost of production
and distribution. But it is something
more. It is also an investment—not only
for him but for all who have a stake in our
economic system—for the competitors who
come along later with similar products, for
the men whom they and he employ, for
the tradesmen and manufacturers whose
services and products those employed in
the manufacture of the new product are
enabled to buy.

There have been those who complain
about the cost of advertising to the
consumer. Some advertisers have answered
that complaint by attempting to segregate
the cost of advertising per article. An answer
in these terms is altogether misleading.
For such is the complexity of our economic
life that we tell a dangerous half-truth
when we try to segregate the advertising
cost per unit of an article. Cost depends
upon quantity. Advertising increases
quantity. By increasing quantity, it decreases
cost. Ask yourself what you paid
twenty years ago for a car, or the battery
in a car, or a tire, or any one of a thousand
articles you use. You pay much less than
you did and you get much more because
millions of your neighbors have helped to
lower the price by swelling the demand—
millions who learned of the product and its
uses through advertising.

But return to the questions posed on
this page last week. What is the justification
for advertising by producers who have
given up part or all of their normal business
and are devoting 70%, 80%, or even
100% of their productive facilities to the
manufacture of goods for defense? What
function does advertising fulfill for them
or for us?

The answers to these questions are obvious
to everyone who understands the
American system—the system which we
are preparing to defend. Perhaps we can
best see it in the large by considering the
position of one of those thousands of
American manufacturers who were suddenly
asked, in 1940, to produce some
product needed for defense and to produce
it in quantity.

Take, for instance, the company that
makes Fiberglas. Here was a new product—
the result of years of painstaking research.
Its makers saw that it had an enormous
variety of potential uses. But first it
was necessary to create a demand for the
product—to inform the public that the
product existed and to explore the purposes
for which the public might wish to
use it. Within a few short years, through
advertising, this informative and exploratory
work built a large civilian market, defined
the types of demand for it, suggested new
avenues of research and greatly increased
production and employment.

Then, with the defense effort, the company
was asked to sell a large part of its
output for defense. Yet it keeps up its research;
it still checks upon current experience; it
continues to prepare the way for
future civilian use of Fiberglas.

Shall this company cease advertising?
Shall it cease its efforts to keep the name
of the product and its uses before buyers,
so that when the defense effort is over it
will find a market? Of course not. Elementary
prudence demands that we permit
this company and thousands of others to
insure their continued ability to employ
men and women and produce goods.

The Vinson bill now before Congress
ignores these facts. Its effect would be to
prevent companies heavily loaded with defense
contracts from spending money on
advertising designed to keep their names
before the public. Those companies which
are not producing for the government
would be free to continue their advertising.
Those companies which are devoting
their energies to defense production would
not. Thus, the more completely companies
had gone into the service of the government,
the less they could remind the public
of their existence.

If the Vinson idea prevails now, such
companies would face postwar readjustment
shorn of the means of helping to
solve the critical employment emergency
that will then confront us all. Without a
sales organization or a vital trade name,
they could not take up where they have
left off. Some could not survive at all. Our
entire economic life would suffer.

Meanwhile, the very character of
the advertising that is appearing during
the emergency performs a useful public
service. Some companies are not advertising
products at all: they are presenting
ideas of general and profoundly important
interest. Some are describing phases in the
defense program in which they are playing
a part. Some are instilling a deeper Americanism
by effective description of parts of
our economic processes. Others are encouraging
a more economical use of their own
products. Still others are revealing the
utility of new products as yet unavailable
to all except the government. All, in one
way or another, are building a deeper patriotism
among our people, by demonstrating
that the economic system that creates
the products which are going into our
guns, tanks, trucks and planes is a system
that can survive the emergency, prevent
national economic collapse, widespread
poverty and unemployment and a return
to depression conditions.
