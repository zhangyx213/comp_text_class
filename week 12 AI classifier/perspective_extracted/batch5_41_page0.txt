**A Luminous Figure**

by Raymond Moley

IN THE late autumn of his life, Bernard Mannes Baruch is reminded in a very practical manner of the immense, not to say fabulous, reputation he has established without the adventitious prop of an official title and without assuming the heavy burdens and heartaches of public office. For his autobiography, "Baruch: My Own Story," has topped the best-seller list for several weeks and promises to go on and on. This is a distinction reserved previously for such self-help books as "Peace of Mind," "Peace of Soul," and "Stay Alive All Your Life." Perhaps the popularity of certain books can give us the key to certain preoccupations of the human animal. I venture to suggest that two of these are intense concern for our own mind, body, and property; and abiding curiosity. Both of these, I surmise, explain in part the amazing popularity of Baruch. He is known as a very wise man with a dollar, and in this present uncertainty about the future we want to know how he got it and how he keeps it. But those who read his autobiography for hot tips will learn to their profit, I hope, that there is no tip so profitable as the suggestion that there are no hot tips.

Curiosity about the man has to do with the extraordinary fact that any private citizen, without holding high office or leading a movement or creating a great business, could have remained in the nation's news so long and so favorably.

**RELATIONS WITH F.D.R.**

The title of this piece is prompted by something I once told him as a reason why Franklin D. Roosevelt, newly established in the White House, was not disposed to make more use of him. I am quoted as saying in Margaret L. Coit's new book, "Mr. Baruch," that he was too luminous a man to be brought prominently on a stage occupied by F.D.R. But that explains only in part why the relationship between the President and the elder statesman was and continued to be strained. Another reason was the conservatism of Baruch. He was the object of suspicion on the part of the growing circle of radicals who gathered under the New Deal.

He was not a flatterer and often told the President some of the unpleasant facts of life. Finally, there was the fact that Baruch was definitely of the Wilson circle, and Roosevelt, who had been cavalierly regarded by such members of that Administration as McAdoo, Baker, Glass, and others, harbored a resentment that closed the door to them in later years.

It is to the everlasting credit of Baruch, however, that he never permitted pique or vanity to blind himself to the fact that F.D.R. was President of the United States, and that to stand a willing volunteer was to serve not just a person but a nation.

**DEEP SENTIMENTS**

To Baruch, patriotism is a matter of deep emotional meaning. His roots are in a past when the nation was torn by fraternal war. His homeland, South Carolina, had been cruelly and unnecessarily devastated by Sherman's army. His father had endured the horrors that attended the life of an Army surgeon.

Later, it was unity within the nation that occupied his life in the many years when he was an adviser of those vested with high office, and that caused him to swallow his pride and serve those who commanded his services but not his respect.

Baruch is unblushingly a man of deep sentiments. His home is dominated by three magnificent portraits of the three men who have meant most in his lifeâ€”Wilson, who gave him more and more of his trust and confidence as the President's circle of close friends contracted after the war; Churchill, whose imperial imagination fascinated him; and his father, Dr. Simon Baruch, whose courage survived the loss of the cause to which he gave so much.

And so Baruch has lived on in growing public esteem as other statesmen have come and gone. Those who have known his friendship know him for his loyalty and wisdom. His advice, as well as all his public utterances, has been deeply cautious. He has marched with the times but has watched his steps and has sometimes walked alone. He has found in the role of a private citizen an incomparable usefulness.
