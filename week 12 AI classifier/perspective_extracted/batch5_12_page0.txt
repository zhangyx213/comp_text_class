California Inquest
by Raymond Moley

ALL calculations concerning the California primary and its meaning must start with the premise that Senator Knowland's defeat was catastrophic. It was also a defeat, although not a rout for the Republican Party. Congressman Hillings, running for attorney general, did well. The combined vote for Governor Knight and Mayor Christopher, both Republicans, was a sizable majority. The prospects are that the present ratio of seventeen Republicans to thirteen Democrats in the California delegation to the U.S. House of Representatives will be held by the GOP and possibly improved.

Final figures show Attorney General Brown running more than 600,000 ahead of Knowland in totals of both primaries. In 1952, Knowland's majority in both primaries was 1.6 million.

Innumerable factors contributed to Knowland's defeat: During the years of Knight's service as governor his stand on various issues alienated a large proportion of the Republicans who had elected him and practically wrecked the party. Also, in the primary Knight ignored Knowland and was known to be bitterly opposed to him. Knowland campaigned only sixteen days, at scattered intervals. Knowland's organization was grossly incompetent. Many businessmen who should have been active were indifferent or covertly sympathetic with Brown—"a good fellow." No real presentation of Knowland's major issue, compulsory unionism, was made while the opposition exploited it to the utmost. Moreover, it was not clear to many why Knowland had suddenly abandoned the Senate, to which he could have been re-elected, and plunged into a fight to push Knight out of the governorship.

BENEATH 'SAFETY'

Meanwhile, as I noted in this space nearly two years ago, the highly efficient political arms of the national and international unions were assiduously at work, in alliance with other "liberal" groups in the counties, creating local organizations and generally beefing up the Democratic Party. It is now well managed and well organized. While superficially the state seemed safely Republican—with whacking majorities for President Eisenhower, Knowland, Knight, Warren, and Nixon-Democratic-labor strength has been growing for ten years in campaigns for minor offices, such as for the State Legislature. This coalition has worked on the principle that in politics "he that is faithful in that which is least" is due for big things by-and-by. There were also the normal dissatisfactions with Republican administrations in Sacramento and Washington, so notable in off years. And there was the recession, too.

The outlook for Knowland in November is not bright, but not hopeless. California is a mercurial state. Anything can happen. Upton Sinclair won the primaries in the big Democratic year 1934, only to go down to utter defeat in November.

SPECIAL PROBLEM

But a big job faces Knowland. His organization must be rebuilt from top (and observers out there emphasize "top") to bottom. The people in favor of the right-to-work amendment must make the issue understandable to workers and voters generally, since it has been grossly misrepresented by Brown and others. Knowland must campaign as only he can do when aroused. His friends must "sell" his real qualities as a statesman, qualities which no state should reject.

The Knight-Knowland break must some way be healed without giving up Knowland's right-to-work issue. Auxiliary forces must be mobilized by business and industrial people and others, just as they were created in support of Taft in Ohio eight years ago.

Moreover, Brown's weaknesses should be revealed, and these are many. After all, he is just a run-of-the-mill politician hopelessly indebted to the union machine. There are plenty of vulnerable spots in his record as attorney general.

The votes are there to overcome even a 600,000 edge. For nearly 900,000 registered Republicans failed to vote in the primaries; and other thousands, who voted for Brown, could be brought back.

Any suggestion that this California situation indicates a national pattern can be wrong. For the California problem is a very special one.
