The order in which these states appear above describes the measure of certainty of the election of three Republican candidates for United States senator. In all three states, the Democratic party has a Senate seat on the line. The three seats constitute a third of the number necessary to tie the party balance. In the three states there are enough close Congressional contests to provide two-thirds of the number of House seats necessary to Republican control. If the strong Republican trend observable in the first half of October continues, these three decisive states will go Republican, and they may carry with them control of both House and Senate.

But will that trend continue? The answer to that depends on what happens in the last week in October. The big question is whether the Republican trend has been a wave or a tide. Was it merely a surface irritation over meat, or was meat discontent an immediate symptom of deep feeling against Washington? A little meat will turn away a lot of anger. The meat issue will disappear by Oct. 25. Then we shall see what the trend really is. This conservative view, I may add, is shared by the most astute Democratic politicians with whom I have talked recently.

Another factor, not usually weighed by glib political forecasters, is whether anger, contempt or indignation will precipitate protest votes. Many people in the low-income brackets may think Mr. Truman is a poor President, that the OPA is terrible and that we are in a mess. But that doesn't mean that they will vote Republican. On election day they may cynically decide that Republicans offer a poor alternative. Habit may be stronger than anger. Mayor Kelly of Chicago counts on this factor. In short, we may measure the anger now, but we cannot measure the force of habit.

Republican overconfidence should be dampened by the danger, always present, of foolish breaks on the Republican side. Senator Taft pulled one such boggle in his remarks about the Nuremberg trials. He thereby saved one of Mayor Kelly's Democratic congressmen in Chicago and helped Democrats in New York. Another cloud, no bigger than a man's hand, is a so-called American Action Committee, with a secret list of purgees. People don't like such silly business.

But what of Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York now?

In Ohio, John Bricker is running very strong in his campaign, and his opponent, Sen. James W. Huffman, seems confused and ineffective. A big victory for Bricker seems likely to win three Democratic House seats for Republican candidates. Gov. Frank Lausche seemed certain to win in August. His apparent lead declined during the meat shortage, but he called on President Truman to lift controls and now enjoys the prestige attendant upon that action. His stock is rising again, but no one can tell how the governorship may go. Lausche seems weaker in industrial districts than in 1944, but stronger in agricultural counties.

All political reporters whom I have consulted in Pennsylvania, including those who work for Democratic papers, predict the election of Gov. Edward Martin to the senatorship. His majority over Guffey is estimated at 200,000 or more. This ought to swing from five to seven of Pennsylvania's House seats from Democratic to Republican. The Republican state ticket, with James H. Duff for governor, looks safe now.

In New York, the polls, the betting odds and the opinions of political reporters all indicate an overwhelming Dewey majority. If he continues to lead by such a substantial margin, he will probably carry Candidate Irving Ives into the Senate. Moreover, if the Republican trend of early October continues, it will capture four Democratic seats in the House.

A favorable omen for New York Democrats is a heavy registration in the big cities. New York City is up one-third of 1942. Republicans say it has been due to indignation over the meat shortage. Democrats say it is mostly a normal increase, due to returned soldiers, returned war workers who, in 1942, were away from the city, new residents and new voters.

All election predictions, however, which are raining down in this season, should be tempered by the considerations suggested earlier in this piece.
