**The Stature of Nixon**

*by Raymond Moley*

THOMAS CARLYLE, in an immortal
essay, reminded us that in passing
judgment upon a captain whose "ship
comes into harbor with shrouds and
tackle damaged," we should consider
the length of the voyage, and the
hazards, vicissitudes, and handicaps
encountered. I might add, in this case,
the capacity of the crew.
Richard Nixon directed his cause
and his party—there is a distinction
here—through a desperately critical
test. His party now is in better shape
than it has enjoyed in three decades.
His cause, which is reasonable
progress at home under sound fiscal
policies and unyielding opposition
abroad to the spread of Communism,
has been supported by an immense
number of Americans.
General Eisenhower, a great mili-
tary hero, won twice with great non-
partisan support. Other than on those
occasions, Nixon's popular vote was
higher than a Republican has had in
almost a generation, even after cor-
rections are made because of the in-
crease in eligible voters. Moreover,
at the outset of the campaign, at the
Chicago convention, Nixon brought a
greater degree of confidence and har-
mony to his party than it had en-
joyed, with the exception of 1956, in
more than 30 years.
Now, of course, that multitude
which is wise after the event will
rush forward to point out what Nixon
did that he should have left undone
and what he left undone that he
should have done. But let us con-
sider what he had to contend with.

**REPUBLICAN WEAKNESS**

Long before the campaign, Nixon
fully recognized the basic weaknesses
of the Republican Party in many
states. Quite generally its machin-
ery was weak, its leaders incompe-
tent; many of its lesser candidates
were unpopular and doomed to de-
feat. Ohio stood alone against the
tide that swept other industrial states.
With an extraordinarily able state
chairman, Ray Bliss, and real activity
among hitherto inactive businessmen,
Nixon-Lodge won despite a crushing
defeat there in 1958.
From the beginning, Nixon's op-
ponent was assured of the highly
efficient and abundantly financed ma-


chine of the AFL-CIO, capable of
mustering from 2 million to 4 million
votes. Kennedy was also assured the
powerful Democratic machines in
most of the great cities, managing, by
hook or crook, as always, solid mi-
nority blocs.
Mr. Eisenhower has been a worthy
and successful President. But as even
F.D.R. said, "Presidents do make mis-
takes." Those omissions and commis-
sions were hurled at Nixon and he
was compelled to defend decisions in
the making of which his was not the
final word. In some instances, Nixon
could not explain circumstances which
he knew very well.

**AUTHENTIC STATESMAN**

In general, what Nixon had to say
in his whirlwind campaign was badly
reported in the press by most of those
assigned to cover his travels. As The
New York Daily News said editori-
ally, 75 per cent of the reporters who
were with him were opposed to his
election, and these men "slanted their
dispatches against Nixon." In the final
two weeks, hope-infected predictions
of a Kennedy victory by seers
and soothsayers—predictions which in
detail are now proved wrong—
discouraged Nixon workers and ener-
gized chronic bandwagon passengers.
There were also the all-or-nothing
reactionaries who sat it out, and the
"liberal" Republicans whose speeches
gave only token support to the Nixon-
Lodge candidacies.
Nixon, by the very magnitude of
his vote, is the authentic leader of
his party. That involves two formida-
ble tasks. He must do what he can
without surrendering principle to pre-
vent a violent struggle within the Re-
publican Party among extremists of
the left and right. Also, to labor to
end the Civil War and Reconstruc-
tion by building a two-party system
in the South.
Nixon campaigned with a deep
sense of responsibility. He promised
no utopia. He favored what was pos-
sible. His dignity in the conflict and
in defeat destroyed forever the myth,
promoted by his enemies, Democratic
and Republican, that he is not a man
of conviction and that "people don't
like him." He emerges as an authentic
leader and statesman.
