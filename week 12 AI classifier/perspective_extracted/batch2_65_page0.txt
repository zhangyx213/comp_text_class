**PERSPECTIVE**

**WAR ON BUSINESS**

BY RAYMOND MOLEY

While the public is fascinated by LBJ's war on poverty, several of the agencies over which the great almoner presides are pursuing their war on business with unabated vigor. A good example is a case which originated with the Darlington Manufacturing Co., a small textile operation which had its origin in South Carolina in 1883. In 1937 it ran into trouble and passed through bankruptcy proceedings. At that time, Deering Milliken, Inc., acquired 41 per cent of the Darlington stock shares. Deering Milliken continued as sales agent for Darlington.

For a while the company did well, but beginning in 1952 it encountered hard going which continued until 1956, when the company was liquidated. There was nothing dubious about this dissolution of the company. Its plant and equipment were sold, and its contracts were transferred to other independent companies. However, early in the year of its liquidation the Textile Workers Union of America had held an organization drive and won a small majority for the union. The National Labor Relations Board certified the union as the employes' bargaining agent. After the liquidation, the union appealed to the NLRB, which sent in a trial examiner. He ruled that closing the business was an unfair labor practice, and also that Darlington was responsible for wages up to the actual termination of the business.

**SWEEPING DECISION**

Nevertheless, the trial examiner ruled that Deering Milliken and its affiliated companies were not to be regarded as a single company with Darlington and were not responsible for the unfair labor practice. He also ruled that there was ample justification for the liquidation other than the presence of the union. The NLRB was not satisfied with the rulings of the trial examiner and three more examinations were held. Ultimately, after the Kennedy Administration took over and substantially reconstructed the NLRB, the NLRB rendered a sweeping decision that the plant closing was an unfair labor practice because one of the reasons was the advent of the union. It also held that Deering Milliken and the companies affiliated with it along with Darlington constituted a single employer and that all were accountable for the unfair labor practice. They were ordered to pay back wages until such time as the employes were either hired by Deering Milliken or were placed on preferential hiring lists in the mills operated by the affiliated companies.

The case was taken to the U.S. Court of Appeals, which decided that Darlington had an "absolute prerogative" to go out of business and that the NLRB had no authority to assess damages. The union appealed the case to the Supreme Court, where it will be argued this fall.

**LIABILITY UNLIMITED**

Two basic principles are involved in this case, both of which bear upon the vast authority which has been assumed by the NLRB. The owners of a business have a right to liquidate their company, provided it is a bona fide closing and does not disturb the public welfare materially. Going out of business, as well as going into business, is a basic element in a free enterprise system. Equally important is the threat that the NLRB decision presents to the principles of corporate liability. In determining that a single employer was involved, the NLRB lumped together numerous companies which were related to Deering Milliken as sales agent. While these companies were owned in varying degrees by the same interests that owned Darlington, they also had hundreds of other stockholders who had no interest in Darlington or in one another. All were held liable. If the Supreme Court should hold one corporation liable for the debts of another simply because there is an identity of stockholders, it would be a devastating blow to the corporate form of business enterprise. It would mean that a corporation could never be sure about its real financial obligations because it could not know the complete holdings of its stockholders. Without the corporate form of business with its limited liability, it would be impossible to raise the capital necessary to keep the nation moving forward and to provide jobs for our ever-growing population.
