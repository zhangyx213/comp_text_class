**Perspective**

**Hands Across the Sea**

*by Raymond Moley*

JAMES R. HOFFA's threat to throttle
the nation's economy, in a speech
to Capt. William V. Bradley's Inter-
national Longshoremen's Association,
should be considered in the context of
meetings to be held at the State De-
partment beginning on June 8. There
will forgather a group of official rep-
resentatives of European shipping na-
tions, including a British, Norwegian,
and Dutch. The purpose is to protest
vigorously against the maritime policy
of the United States Government.

Earlier meetings between Hoffa
and Joseph Curran of the National
Maritime Union, Paul Hall of the
Seafarers International Union, and
Bradley in New York; a hurried trip
to England by Curran and Hall with
Hoffa's backing to plan joint action
with Omer Becu of the International
Transportworkers Federation; con-
tinued protests by Norwegian official
sources and shipping interests; and
much talk against our policies in the
British Lords and Commons-all spring
from related movements against our
shipping. The American unions which
boycotted certain American-owned
ships last December acted under the
leadership of the European ITF. And
to complete the picture, Becu will be
in Washington during the June meet-
ings to whip up sentiment against our
government's policies.

**THREE-PRONGED DRIVE**

While officialdom of European
maritime countries and the shipping
interests of those nations are practi-
cally identical, American shipping in-
terests have been barred by the State
Department from participation in the
meetings. The tie between Norwegian
officialdom and the shipowners of that
country is illustrated by the fact that
the representative of the shipowners'
association has an official status in the
Norwegian Embassy in Washington.

The plan of attack by the European
representatives for the June meeting
was carefully outlined in a confidential
memorandum last November by the
British Council of Shipping. This
stated a three-pronged drive: Against
our law, which has not been fulfilled,
requiring that 50 per cent of foreign-
aid cargoes be shipped in U.S.-flag
vessels; against our subsidy laws
which were enacted in 1936 to pro-
vide us with a merchant marine as a
vital arm of our defense forces. Their
most bitter complaint is against our
government-approved system of reg-
istering American-owned tankers and
cargo ships under the flags of Liberia,
Panama, and Honduras.

It is in the latter case that the kin-
ship of the burning assaults upon us
is displayed-in the Commons and
Lords, in the Norwegian press, in the
screaming about "pirates" by Becu,
and in the talk about "assassination"
and "runaways" by the heads of
American transport unions. A strange
concert of interest, indeed, consider-
ing the fact that two of the American
unions involved have been expelled
from the AFL-CIO because of the
character of some of their leading
members! Hoffa's talk was not merely
a threat against the Congress of the
United States, but a part of an inter-
national alliance. Moreover, his rela-
tions with Harry Bridges' outcast
International Longshoremen's and
Warehousemen's Union have been
cemented for future activity.

**VERY SLICK**

The British memorandum is very
slick. The appeal to abandon this part
of our merchant marine to the cus-
tody of Europeans will be in a good
name: "It would be preferable to
transfer such ships to flags of the
NATO countries." This, in the eco-
nomic interest of NATO. Wage costs
would be comparable or generally
lower than they are now. Presumably
United States companies and banks
would finance new construction
abroad. Everything would be fine,
except that we would surrender our
competitive position to a rival econ-
omy. In case of war the United States
would not have the ships available,
as it does now. Adm. Emory S. Land
emphasized in this space some weeks
ago that we have learned the terrible
lesson of trying to secure ships in
wartime. And suppose we get into a
war in the Pacific with Red China
and these nations are neutral? Our
forces must operate on the oil carried
by such tankers, as they did in Korea.
No one blames Britain and other
nations for fighting for their interests.
We should protect ours with equal
intelligence and determination.
