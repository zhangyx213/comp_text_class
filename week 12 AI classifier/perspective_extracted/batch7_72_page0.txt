**The Happy Warrior's Comrade-at-Arms**

by RAYMOND MOLEY

JOSEPH M. PROSKAUER is one of those
rare men whose words and phrases
are familiar in the households of the
land—not through avowed authorship,
but as the utterances of a notable na-
tional figure. For Judge Proskauer was
the principal architect of many of Al
Smith’s most memorable speeches and
papers. He also created for Franklin
D. Roosevelt the famous Happy
Warrior speech nominating
Smith in 1924 for the Presi-
dency. No one, with the
possible exception of Robert
Moses, held more of Smith’s
confidence and knows more
of the historic relationship
between Governor Smith
and his successor.

It is that aspect of Judge
Proskauer’s new book of
recollections, “A Segment of
My Times,”* that gives it place in the
perspective of those years in which
Roosevelt played so important a part.
It is a corrective for much of the
undiscriminating appraisal of Roosevelt
that has filled the bookstores.

It has been known that the begin-
ning of the break between Smith and
Roosevelt lay in the period shortly
after Roosevelt succeeded Smith as
governor. But until now, the complete
story has not been told by a responsible
person who knew Smith’s deepest
feelings on the subject.

Mrs. Roosevelt alludes to the break
in her recent book of memoirs, but
with a rationalization that is peculiarly
her own. She attributes Smith’s atti-
tude toward her husband to the sense
of superiority felt by a self-made man
toward another man who had greater
educational and cultural advantages.
In short, because Smith had made his
way on his own, he thought he was a
better man than someone who had
been helped by inherited wealth and
a Harvard education. Shorter still, she
implies, in a peculiar inverted sense,
that Smith was a snob.


opportunities were certainly as great
as those of Roosevelt and whose use
of them was most unusual.

The Proskauer account is that, after
Smith had prevailed on Roosevelt to
run for governor and after Roosevelt
had been elected, Smith in a com-
pletely generous manner readied him-
self to help him get under way. He
experienced a somewhat chilly and
uncalled-for rebuff. He was
hurt, as any generous soul
had a right to be.

Subsequently, Smith real-
ized while Roosevelt might
serve well as governor, the
Presidency would present
problems with which Smith
believed him to be unfitted
to cope. Proskauer writes:
“Smith felt that there was
an offsetting lack of sober
judgment, of painstaking investigation
and a propensity to play those
hunches to a dangerous degree, par-
ticularly in the formulation of the
domestic policies of the nation.”

He saw in Roosevelt an “impatience
with legal restraint,” in which he felt
grave danger. Also, he felt that
Roosevelt was prone in statecraft to
what lawyers call “practicing by ear.”
By 1934 Smith made his protests over
the Roosevelt policies clear and well
known. Finally, Smith and Proskauer,
despite life-long adherence to the
Democratic Party, broke completely
and supported the opposition.


JUDGE PROSKAUER’S relationship with
Smith signified not so much his
concern with the life of politics as
with the deeper values for which he
saw Smith as an exponent. Religious
tolerance, better government, and in-
ternational responsibilities have all
been served in Judge Proskauer’s long
life. He served notably as president of
the American Jewish Committee dur-
ing six years in which desperate prob-
lems of humanitarian endeavor were
met. He had a major part in the crea-
tion of the Declaration of Human
Rights. And he participated in a con-
structive way in the creation of the
State of Israel.

Judge Proskauer’s book is the mov-
ing chronicle of a very useful Ameri-
can who deserves as much as Smith
the title which made his speech un-
forgettable—the Happy Warrior.
