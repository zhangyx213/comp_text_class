**The Vice President**

by Raymond Moley

It is not strange that Vice President
Nixon's world tour should stimulate
renewed talk about what should
be the present status and activities
and even the future usefulness of this
young statesman who has time on his
hands. To a degree, the determination
of his present status and activities
depends upon him. His future will be
determined by others. Neither will be
determined by those who
are engaged in speculating
about him.

For many years the
Vice Presidents were neutral
presiding officers over
the Senate, and their major
responsibility aside from
that was to keep their
mouths shut. They became
sources of innocent merriment,
which in itself was a
contribution to the happiness of a
sorely tried nation. There were, however,
men who occupied that strange
niche in public life with quiet dignity.
Indeed, in some cases innocuous desuetude
became them. They were
clearly behaving in the manner decreed
by the Constitution.

For the only duty bestowed by the
Constitution upon the Vice President
except "when he shall exercise the
office of President" is to be President
of the Senate. Since this provision is in
Article I, his status is that of a member
of the legislative branch of government.
Article II states that "In case
of the removal of the President from
office, or of his death, resignation, or
inability to discharge the powers and
duties of the said office, the same
shall devolve on the Vice President."

Vice Presidents in the more immediate
past have filled the roles for
which circumstances and their own
special qualities have fitted them.
Alben Barkley became a charming and
respected elder statesman and
the companion and adviser of fellow
senators. Wallace was the international
busybody, for which he was so
well qualified. From the administrative
job of head of the BEW, bestowed
upon him by F.D.R., he later
had to be rescued. Of all recent Vice
Presidents, John N. Garner added
most luster to the office and created
precedents which his successors might
well follow. He strictly kept hands off
administrative departments. He gave the
President advice only when asked
and then with rigorous candor. He
was the friend and counselor of members
of both House and Senate but no
bearer of Presidential messages. For
he was a true man of Congress, seasoned
by service there during the
administrations of seven Presidents.
As a national officer he kept his hands
off the politics of his own state. I once
saw a congressman introduce
him to a recent governor
of Texas.

Nixon will have a hard
job living up to the Garner
standard for reasons other
than his lack of the Garner
experience. One of those
reasons is the overanxiety of
some of his friends in California.
Another is the anxiety
of writers that no one,
in these days when full employment
is a national obsession, shall be without
a full-time job. Another reason is
the shrewd strategy of Democrats
who would dazzle and then destroy.
If, as some are saying, the recent
world tour was connived at to build
up the Vice President for the Presidency,
they are doing both Nixon and
the President a grievous injustice.
Those who portray him as a factor in
budget-cutting are casting him in a
role in which violent friction will
break out in the Cabinet. Those who
suggest him as the shepherd of the
President's legislative program in the
Senate ignore the Senate's own
leader, Sen. William Knowland, and
such a division of responsibility would
be disastrous to the President and the
Republican Party alike. Finally, to
project the Vice President into California
politics will precipitate a clash
there with California's legitimate Republican
leader, who is also Senator
Knowland. That would deliver the
state to the Democrats.

I cannot believe that the Vice President
realizes that any of the circumstances
mentioned above would injure his
party as well as himself. I can believe,
however, that such suggestions arise
from the guile of Democrats intent
upon destroying Mr. Eisenhower,
Nixon, and the Republican Party, operating
upon the guilelessness of some
of Nixon's friends.
