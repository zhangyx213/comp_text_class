**PERSPECTIVE**

**THE GOP MAINSTREAM**

**BY RAYMOND MOLEY**

The word "mainstream" was vaguely and inaccurately used by Governor Rockefeller and others to belabor Barry Goldwater in 1964. But at this moment, when rivals for the Republican Presidential nomination are expressing their views about Vietnam, it has a special relevance. Many years ago, Republican Presidents and Secretaries of State clearly defined American interests in the Pacific and the East Asian perimeter. Their policies not only are still valid, but they have in the past 34 years been accepted by Democratic and Republican Presidents alike. In the light of these policies it may be quite appropriate to measure the views of various Republican leaders on Vietnam.

This year we should celebrate the centennial of a great period in the career of William H. Seward and in the history of the GOP. For within twelve months in 1867 that Secretary of State made four important decisions about American interests in the Pacific. At the instance of Russia, he achieved the purchase of Alaska and the islands which reach almost to Japan and the Asian mainland. He proposed the annexation of Hawaii. He brought about the American occupation of the Midway Islands. And he negotiated a treaty with Nicaragua which looked toward the construction by the United States of an isthmian canal.

**OBJECTIVES IN PACIFIC**

The vision of Seward saw two objectives in this extension of American interests. One was the defense of the United States, which had already reached the shores of the Pacific. The other was to provide access for our trade with Asia and the islands of the Western Pacific. The latter had been a concern of American policy well before Seward. For while European powers had their colonies and ports over there, we had to depend upon diplomatic negotiations to keep open those areas for our growing commerce. In 1852 and after, we had opened Japan and had gained a foothold on adjacent islands. Our interest was not exclusive. We wanted to assure access to all trading nations.

Hawaii remained a primary objective of successors of Seward. In the last months of the Harrison Administration, Secretary of State John W. Foster negotiated annexation and introduced it in the Senate. But Cleveland withdrew the treaty. It was revived when McKinley took office and was finally confirmed in 1898.

The superficial reason for American intervention in Cuba in 1898 was humanitarian, but members of the Senate and Theodore Roosevelt, Assistant Secretary of the Navy, had in mind the assurance of our right to build an isthmian canal as a gateway to the Pacific. But TR looked beyond that and secured the appointment of Commodore Dewey as commander of our Pacific fleet. And so the treaty with Spain found us in the Philippines. The urgency of this move was to frustrate the plans of Imperial Germany to acquire the archipelago.

**TOO LATE FOR ISOLATION**

Thus the outpost of our defense became the perimeter of Asia. We craved no territory, but we needed Luzon and the harbor of Manila to serve our interests in the Far Pacific. Then John Hay, Secretary of State under McKinley and TR, achieved the Open Door in China.

Seapower, as Roosevelt saw it, was the key to our Pacific policy. Hence he envisioned a great navy. But Wilson, preoccupied by Europe, permitted Japan to begin its imperial expansion through mandated Pacific islands. By 1933 our posture in the Pacific and in the periphery of Asia became national policy. In truth no political Administration ever really ends, and none ever begins anew. And so FDR adopted the Stimson policy of checkmating Japanese expansion. FDR, who was Navy-minded and who had hereditary concerns in the China trade, accepted the Japanese challenge. By the end of World War II, we had not only vast interests in the Asiatic area but vast commitments there.

Presidents Truman and Johnson inherited this policy, and that is why we were in Korea and are now in Vietnam. It is far, far too late to ignore what happens in the non-Communist countries of the Far East. Our responsibility lies in our geographical position, our vast economic resources and an unquiet world.

Thus the ambivalence of Romney, Percy, Morton and other isolationist Republicans places them far outside the mainstream of Republican policy. It is fortunate that a majority of Republican leaders support our posture in Vietnam, although they may differ in details of strategy. We are a world power, and we must behave like one.
