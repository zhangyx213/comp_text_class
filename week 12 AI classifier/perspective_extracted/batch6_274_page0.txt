**Barkley the Minnesinger**

by Raymond Moley

MY ETYMOLOGY fails to clarify the
point whether the word "minne-
singer" literally translated means "love
to sing" or "sing of love." But which-
ever way you put it, there could be no
more appropriate way to describe our
Vice President. For never since Walter
von der Vogelweid (Bird Meadow) in
the thirteenth century has there been
a more authentic representative of a
happy but now almost ex-
tinct species. Exception must
be allowed for that great
troubadour of our own era,
William Jennings Bryan.
But surely since Jennings
breathed his last on a Sun-
day afternoon after a hearty
meal of fried chicken, pota-
toes, and gravy, the Demo-
crats have had no peer to
the mellifluous Alben.
If Democrats yearning to hold all
their blessings in the four years ahead
have sense, they will consider the
popularity of their Vice President and
offer him as their candidate for President.
And, I may add, Democrats are
not slow in recognizing such indispen-
sable but scarce talent.
At the first ball game in Washington
the venerable Vice President, accom-
panied by the still more venerable
Clark Griffith, walked out on the field.
The resourceful Veep paused at the
home plate, squatted umpirewise, and
extended his hands to signify "safe."
The din was tremendous. I ask you,
who among all the other aspirants
could have gotten away with that?
In fact, most of them couldn't have
thought of it.
Consider, if you will, the indispen-
sability of the Vice President at one of
those Democratic affairs known as One
Hundred Dollar Dinners. Unlike the
custom in the old Bryan days, the long,
long succession of orators who speak
now have carefully written speeches.
Television has dealt a deadly blow to
their readings. For not only are the
texts reeking with threadbare plati-
tudes and moldy political clich√©s, but
the speakers seem by their intent
peering at the scripts to indicate that
they have never before read them
and that they fear lest the ghost writer
has planted therein some fearful indis-
cretion. Behind said speakers usually
sit a bevy of bored and distracted
diners. Every faction in the party, every section of the country and, in
years like this, every candidate must
be allowed to talk. By tradition when
Democrats break bread they must sit
for hours after in discomfort.
But Alben is always diverting. He
seems to be the only Democrat left
who can speak without a manuscript.
And surely he possesses the only
known Democratic sense of humor.
His popularity is unques-
tioned. After long years in
the Senate he enjoys the af-
fection of men of all parties
and all factions. The public
likes him. To dislike Alben
Barkley would be like hat-
ing the springtime or show-
ing contempt for Christmas.
If he were nominated, it
would take an extraordinary
Dixiecrat to revolt.
Ah! but there is the troublesome
matter of the actuarial figures, for
Alben was born back in the Hayes
Administration. This would check any
group of conscientious people in se-
lecting a candidate. But in 1944 those
rogues who ran things at the Demo-
cratic convention proved that they
were not the kind who looked too
closely at medical reports or actuarial
charts. For they nominated a man
whom they believed to be unable to
live through his term, and then pro-
ceeded to pick a healthy Vice Presi-
dent with scrupulous care. This can
happen again. And if it does and if
Alben is elected, I for one will pray
that Alben will check Father Time in
his tracks and live through. For it can
be assumed that the candidate they
pick for Vice President will be vastly
inferior and certainly less interesting
than the durable minnesinger.

AND if he is nominated and elected,
I propose a simple inaugural ad-
dress in rhyme. It is taken from the
golden age of jongleurs and is at-
tributed to the great Raimbaut:

In heat or cold, to come and go,
To trot and gallop, run and leap,
To toil and suffer, scorn to sleep,
This is the life I'm now to know.

If and when that happens, there
will be little for all of us to do but join
in those words. For our songs will be
all that we shall have left.
