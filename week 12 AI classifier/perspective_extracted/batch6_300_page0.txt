**Perspective**

**Aftermath of Delusion**

*by Raymond Moley*

THE Labor Party remains a potent
threat and a challenge to the new
government of Britain. That is a fixed,
perhaps permanent, fact, and it is the
best assurance that the Conservatives
will do their utmost to succeed. But
socialism as a policy and a way of
life has been weighed, tasted, tested,
and repudiated. This is shown not
only by the verdicts of the voters at
two elections, but by the
actions and words of the
Labor leaders themselves.

The Conservative major-
ity is more adequate than
comfortable. Those who
claim that this is not a
"working" majority overlook
the lessons of British politi-
cal history. Parties have
been in power in more than
half the years during the
past century which not only lacked
the absolute majority of this new Con-
servative government, but were in a
position to be cast out at any mo-
ment. No one can say that those
governments have not "worked." The
test now is how the Conservatives clean
up the mess they have taken over.
Considering the incompetence of those
who created the mess, it would be
hard not to make a great improvement.

ANOTHER factor seems to have been
overlooked. The Labor Party re-
ally legislated their small majority in
1950. They had abolished the twelve
university constituencies. Those seats
were filled at the 1945 election by
seven Conservatives, two Liberals, and
the others were independent. Not one
was Labor. Labor abolished those seats
in 1947. Had they been retained, the
1950 story would have been different.

The Labor Party has lost a great
deal since 1945 when it filled 394
seats. One hundred of those are gone.
This is one measure of the electorate's
judgment of socialism.

More important, much more impor-
tant, has been the inferential aban-
donment of socialism by the high
command and most of the Parliamen-
tary representatives of the Labor Party
itself. This is proved out of their own
mouths. Radicals are always slick in
juggling the vocabulary. And so the
language of Attlee, Morrison, et al.,
has run to "welfare," "planning," "fair
shares," "social benefits," and "democ-
racy." I failed to hear socialism or na-
tionalization mentioned by Attlee in
1950. This time also he was the
prophet in soft garments.

Politicians are prone to temper doc-
trine to the veering winds of opinion.
Their concern is personal power. The-
ories are not ends but means. In this
respect, these people have advanced
on Dunsinane hidden under
verbal branches stolen from
the Liberal woods.

Aneurin Bevan, an authen-
tic Marxian, would say, per-
haps he now will say, that
the ills of the Labor Party
are due to the fact that it is
no longer socialist. Now the
inter-Labor fight will begin
in earnest. Perhaps these
Bevanites would rather not
be in power until they can purge the
party of the Attlee compromisers. But
unless a tragic national crisis takes
place, that time will not come. Mean-
while, the real Socialists will return
to the role to which they are accus-
tomed, which is agitation and attack.
They never seemed to feel at home
in office anyhow.

And so socialism has been cast off in
all the English-speaking world except
in Fair Deal Washington. There, too,
it hides under the guise of the "welfare
state," "social benefits," and other dis-
tracting phrases. The politicians who
now direct our own destinies know
that Americans will never accept so-
cialism under that name. Hence they,
too, adopt soft words for the realities
of statism. A century and a quarter
ago, Alexis de Tocqueville warned us
that we need never fear tyrants, but
guardians. "I have always thought," he
wrote, "that servitude of the regular,
quiet, and gentle kind...might be
combined with some of the outward
forms of freedom." But these gentle
ministers of paternalism are not usually
equipped with clear heads. They are
incapable of understanding what may
come of their theories. The warm-
hearted, God bless them, are some-
times the soft-minded, God keep them.

THE mask has been torn from such
leaders in Great Britain. It ought
to happen here in our own country
before too many are living on too few.
