**7â€”Our Foreign Trade**

Foreign trade is a subject in which wishful thinking and rational expectation are eternally in conflict. Whenever, in the course of years, I have suggested in this space a caution against rosy promises on this subject, indignant letters have come in.  "Don't you think we ought to have more foreign trade?" they ask.

Of course! Everybody does. But that isn't the point.

Perhaps this trend toward the nonrational is what makes promises and predictions about foreign trade such rich meat for politicians. Every candidate for President makes a bid by promising more foreign trade. But few Administrations in the past half-century have seen such promises materialize.

Loans were the magic supposed to help trade in the Coolidge-Hoover days, just as loans are now the magic capsule of Truman and Wallace. But the curves of all international loans and trade from 1900 to the late 1920s show that, while loans rose to tremendous heights, trade was only slightly increased in volume. And when loans went down, trade decreased for a while at an even greater rate. Herbert Hoover, who, in 1928, preached the value of loans as a stimulant to trade, now says that the amount of increase trade which comes from loans is very small.

Those who expect considerable increases in foreign trade point to the theory that when a country becomes a creditor, trade increases. They also point to the great needs of an impoverished world and to what the war showed to be our vast capacity to produce and to consume. It is also true that one great industry after another, such as those producing automobiles, farm machinery and motion pictures, has outgrown the need for protection.

There are factors, however, which should be set beside these reasons for optimism. Experience has shown that foreign trade increases at a vastly slower rate than domestic trade, even in periods of booming prosperity. Technology, which will attain its golden age in the years to come, consistently works against the tide of foreign trade. For as technology spreads to undeveloped countries, they become more self-sufficient and they begin to process their own raw materials. The great necessities now apparent in war-ridden countries are more temporary than most of us realize. Russia will make heavy demands in our markets for a long time, because it needs not only to be restored, but to be developed. Britain, which must increase her foreign trade by 50 per cent, will be a strong competitor. Other countries will be racing for outlets for their goods.

With due appreciation of these reasons for caution, we should, however, address ourselves to a number of constructive steps for the long future.

Our general tariff policy should be toward a gradual reduction of duties. The rate of reduction should be tempered in accordance with the needs of domestic trade and employment. The method of reduction should aim at securing the reduction of tariffs in other countries.

We should, moreover, use our present great strength and bargaining power to induce other countries to abolish preferential systems, to limit cartels and to temper the action of government monopolies.

Above all, our foreign-trade policy should accept the fact that it is better for the world and better for us that every country should become increasingly industrialized. The world cannot find peace when some countries are industrialized and others are condemned merely to produce raw materials. As long as that old concept persists, raw material countries will be the prey of the advanced nations. And those so-called advanced nations will quarrel over the spoils.

Hence, our greatest American contribution to the world economy will be the export of brains, of know-how and of ideas, rather than of fabricated goods. Whatever we contribute through the labors abroad of American-trained technicians will work for good will for us and lasting peace for all.
