**Dewey**

The phenomenon of Tom Dewey's national popularity grows no less "phenomenal," as the beloved Joe Humphreys used to say, because of its durability. For months, polls of public opinion have shown that Dewey was not only the leading Republican contender, but that his margin of advantage over his runners-up was immense, overwhelming, conclusive. In May, according to the Gallup poll, he was first choice of 54 per cent of Republicans. Taft followed with 15 per cent and Vandenberg with 13 per cent. It was clear that this lead could hardly be held by a newcomer in national politics, especially by a newcomer whose opportunity to increase his reputation by new exploits was strictly limited. Part of the loudly prophesied decline of Dewey's popularity has now taken place. The newest Gallup poll for July shows that he has dropped to 47 per cent. Vandenberg is up to 19 per cent, and Taft is at 18 per cent. At this rate, Dewey's popularity can have the vapors for some time and still leave him the outstanding Republican possibility.

Many things contribute to this extraordinary showing—the shiny newness of Dewey, as contrasted with the marks of political wear and tear on his more experienced elders; the fascination that success stories have for all human beings and the even greater fascination of stories of crime, punishment and virtue triumphant; the widespread notion that Dewey is "safe," but not in too stuffy a way; and the belief that the fire that is Mr. Roosevelt cannot be put out by a wet blanket. Still, when all this has been said, Dewey's popularity remains remarkable.

Thomas Edmund Dewey was born 37 years ago in Owosso, Mich., where his father edited a weekly newspaper. His early life was lived in an atmosphere redolent of politics, and no doubt Teddy Roosevelt was his hero. Those were the days when Ann Arbor was the Oxford of Michigan, Ohio and Indiana. Smart boys wanted to go there. Farsighted parents tried to send them. Dewey went. With his B.A. from the University of Michigan, a ringing baritone voice and boundless ambition, he came to New York eighteen years ago, where he graduated from the Columbia Law School and set himself up in what was, for a beginner, an exceptionally successful practice.

Presently, he was the United States District Attorney's natty, bright-eyed first assistant, successfully prosecuting "Waxey" Gordon. Two years later, in 1935, when it became apparent that public opinion demanded a thoroughgoing opening up of the racketeering situation in New York, Governor Lehman appointed him special prosecutor—the same Lehman, ironically, whose honorable career as Governor the young man would come within a hair's breadth of terminating in 1938.

Dewey has done a good job as New York's District Attorney since 1938. The need for competence in that job had screamed for years. Dewey has hung up a better record than Jerome or Whitman made long ago. Only Earl Warren of Oakland, Calif., now Attorney General of that state, has ever approached Dewey's achievement as D.A. Trampling on the policy of generally bargaining with criminals by accepting pleas to lesser offenses, he has succeeded in doing what hundreds of wiseacres in public office insisted could not be done. It is on this that his reputation rests among the initiated.

But his more spectacular performances are not to be pooh-poohed. He has avoided the tendency of many D.A.'s to seek the headlines on every possible occasion. And it's fantastically easy for prosecutors to get front-page news by aimless flourishes—which is one reason why so many great public figures from little prosecutors grow. Dewey's activity has demonstrated that when he aims, he shoots, and when he shoots, he's pretty accurate in his marksmanship.

To try such cases as the Jimmy Hines case takes analytical power, skill and self-restraint of a high order. Much as we may complain these days of the litigious concept of government, which looks upon government as a battle between the lawyers of the Lord and the lawyers of business, there is much to be said for the mental discipline involved in successful litigation. The lawyer may not always be right, but a good one must know how to use his brain, to learn fast, to appraise evidence and to present his case effectively. Dewey does. He seems, in addition, to possess the rare gift of picking able men, of backing them up, and of eliciting that enthusiasm that makes for successful public service.

Yet this doesn't mean that Dewey now has what it takes to be either a Presidential candidate or a President. As candidate he would have to talk to the voters of their problems—problems of an immensely complex and comprehensive nature—in terms so exact, searching and informed that he would lay bare the widely popularized and plausible economic fallacies of the past few years. This isn't a job a man can get on top of after a short process of self-education. Nor is it something that informed associates can successfully help him do between now and next Wednesday. It is true that Roosevelt learned much in 1932. But it is also true that what he acquired then was added on to 25 years of remarkably diversified experience in state and national affairs.

The Republican candidate can make an effective campaign in 1940 against Roosevelt or any one other Democrat only if he can demonstrate dramatically and intelligently that since 1937 the New Deal has not been moving toward its professed objectives but away from them; that it is making the country poorer while seeking to create the illusion that the average man is growing richer; and that its humane purposes can only be achieved by an administration which has, at least, an elementary knowledge of economic cause and effect. It is highly doubtful that Dewey is equipped for this kind of campaign, quick as he can be on his feet. Whether Republican leaders will take the gamble will depend upon how bad they think their chances are. If they feel reasonably sure of winning, they will turn to a less glamorous man with experience.

Certainly Dewey cannot get very far with the tactics used in the campaign against Lehman—the tactics at which he seems strongest. He cannot campaign against bosses, spoils and corruption. That goes well enough in local and even in state campaigns. It will not do for a national appeal. Especially, it will fail against the New Deal. Whatever indictment may be leveled against this Administration, it cannot be charged with venality. Charges of muddleheadedness, fanaticism and intellectual indirection may stick. But this Administration doesn't steal. One might as easily try to convict Gandhi of fur robbery.

And just as inexperience would hamper Dewey as a candidate, so would it limit his effectiveness as President. The chief executive's job is only in small part that of vigorously enforcing laws. As a matter of fact, a good chief executive delegates that part of his work to others. The essence of the job is evolving policies by adjustment—by endlessly delicate and informed adjustment. That involves a deep understanding of the problems of business, labor and agriculture. It involves familiarity with the technique of working with a legislature. In this sense, the availability of several other putative Republican nominees is so much more marked than Dewey's that it cannot help but cause his prospects to dwindle.
