**A Story That Sings**

THE TEMPLE OF THE GOLDEN PAVILION.
By Yukio Mishima. Illustrated by Fumi
Komatsu. 262 pages. Knopf. $4.

In 1950 in Kyoto, the Zen temple of
Kinkakuji, a masterpiece of Buddhist
garden architecture more than 500 years
old, was burned to the ground by an
acolyte who was also psychotic. All of
Japan was shocked, much as we would
be if some unhinged civics student blew
up the Statue of Liberty. "The Temple
of the Golden Pavilion" is a fictional ac-
count of the life of the young acolyte.
The temple destroyer here explains
himself in a movingly poetic way. There

are, of course, clinical suggestions—such
as the young man’s stuttering, his ugli-
ness, and a severe sexual disturbance—
but the real force behind his action is
seen less as a matter of psychology than
of the spirit. It is precisely this which
elevates Yukio Mishima’s novel from the
level of “Compulsion” to that of a minor
key “Crime and Punishment.”

Intruder: The Golden Temple is to
Mizoguchi not only a beautiful object,
but the embodiment of all beauty, the
very form of beauty itself; and it is for
this reason that he first falls in love with
it (literally, so that he is unable to have
relations with women because the image
of the temple is forever intruding),
yearns for its destruction, and is com-
pelled finally to destroy it. By this act he
gives it the one important quality it did
not share with everything else that is
loved: Transience, perishability.

“Never did there come a time when
the beauty of the Golden Temple
ceased!” he explains. “Its beauty was
always echoing somewhere . . . If one
compared this beauty to a sound, the
building was like a little golden bell that
has gone on ringing for five and a half
centuries, or else like a small harp. But
what if the sound should stop?”

Esthetics, Zen-thought, and the un-
earthly lyricism of Yukio Mishima’s prose
(sensitively translated by Ivan Morris)
combine to make “The Temple of the
Golden Pavilion” a delicately forceful
work of art. Mishima, 33, has written
a dozen novels, several successful plays,
essays, and short stories.
