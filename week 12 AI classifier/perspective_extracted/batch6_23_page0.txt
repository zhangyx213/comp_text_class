**An Embarrassed Senator**

by Raymond Moley

SEN. Mike Mansfield has inherited from Senator Gore the chairmanship of the subcommittee on Privileges and Elections and with it the embarrassing task of explaining and correcting the mass of inaccuracy and bias embodied in the subcommittee's report on 1956 campaign finances. I discussed that 928-page, 4-pound report in this space under dates of March 4 and 11.

In a long answer to my articles and to a devastating criticism of the report by Senator Schoeppel on March 29, Mansfield claims that, considering the prodigious task assumed, the subcommittee did "its very best," and that the errors and omissions are not substantial. Lord Clive, under charges for his conduct in India, said that he was "astonished at his own moderation."

I assume that the senator had little to do with the compilation of the report, but in his defense he does not touch its cardinal offense. This was to create, by a selection and grouping of contributions and by glaring inconsistencies, an alleged documentation of the charge made by his party in the 1956 campaign that the Eisenhower Administration is the creature of predatory businesses and men of great wealth, and that successful men of business cannot be trusted with public offices and responsibilities.

**MISSING DEMOCRATS**

The senator promises that if there is to be a reprint of the report (which is now unavailable), "every effort will be made to correct such errors and omissions." In many of his efforts, I have had reason to admire the senator, and in his new task I want to offer him a few helpful suggestions:

In a category of twelve rich families, the report says that "in the case of the du Pont family 900 members were checked." It then lists 73, including in-laws, all Republican. But some large du Pont contributions went to the Democrats, including that of J.H. Tyler McConnell, who gave $7,250 and was Democratic candidate for governor of Delaware. Since the subcommittee's staff had these figures, why were they omitted from the du Pont list?

Certain categories were clearly established to create the inference that government favor was being sought by Republican contributors. But to "prove" the point, serious distortions and omissions were practiced. The list of contributions from officials and directors of airlines is heavily Republican, but omits several large contributors to the Democrats. The category "100 largest military prime contractors" contains duplications which impair the entire summary. Four contributors are listed more than once, which pads the total by $112,339.

**THE ABA PROTESTS**

One man is listed not only under the two categories above, but in three others, which means that his contribution is counted five times. The unfair arranging of names to fit categories is made the subject of a protest to Senator Mansfield by the president of the American Bar Association. He says that because of a magazine article based on the report there were widespread protests from among the 90,000 association members. The category included only six members. Five of these gave to the Republicans; one, to the Democrats. Two of these were Joseph W. Henderson, a Republican, who gave $1,500, and Richard Bentley, a Democrat, who gave $2,500. The latter is Adlai Stevenson's law partner.

Mansfield admits that since such men have large and numerous interests, their personal contributions could be listed under various headings. I might add that a "Republican" case could also be made against any given church or charity.

Contributions from labor unions are treated very tenderly. The representatives of the unions were permitted to decide for themselves what expenditures were political. Why this special treatment? Consider this in the light of the Supreme Court's decision that certain activities which the unions call "education" are really political. Why did the subcommittee fail to get an accounting of the manpower used by the unions, which was decisive in many districts?

The senator's task of revision will not be easy, for vast statistical operations will have to be done over at great expense. But my best wishes go with him.
