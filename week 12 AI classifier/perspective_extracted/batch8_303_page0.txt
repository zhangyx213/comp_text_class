**Inflation**

Whisperings of the prospect of more inflation have been growing this winter into murmurings and now, at last, into active discussion. President Roosevelt and the Treasury are opposed this time, sincerely trying to hold down the deficit and even expecting the forthcoming borrowing of $300,000,000 will be the last in many a year.

But new expenditures may force the Administration down the same old road. Relief, for one thing ($250,000,000 added last week); the navy bill (possibly $300,000,000 more); the proposal of a great system of national highways—all these things lend currency to inflation talk.

The tendency toward more wages for less work, so marked in 1937, is generally recognized as a decisive inflationary factor. A farm policy looking to the maintenance of farm prices is another. The influence of these factors, it seems, is to remain. There are still other possibilities. Congress always finds them. Eventually something will have to be appropriated for old-age pensions out of the Social Security intake now used for the ordinary expenditures of government. The possibility of spending the gold profit in direct outlays has been suggested outside the Administration.

Sooner or later, come revival in business, the new money injected into the credit stream will start prices up again and set in motion the phenomena of 1935 and 1936.

Alternatives to inflation are easy to propose but hard to execute. They have an oddly reminiscent ring. One is to let the depression run on until prices, wages, debts, building costs and government income and expenditures find a natural level or balance, and confidence returns. Another is to launch some new program of reform, some untried brand of state capitalism, such as vast home building by government for rental or sale, which will inspire and stimulate the nation. A third is to obtain such a lifting of international fears and trade barriers that our export industries snap into recovery. None of these is immediately within the grasp of this Administration, and two of them are politically risky.

Nobody can even guess how an inflationary course would go this time, so many efforts to stimulate it having failed some years ago and so much determination to hold down the deficit being present this time. Perhaps industry would take a long while to regain confidence or get excited. But there is a strong suspicion that if we don't get a thumping recovery this spring we may repeat many of the old experiments with only slight changes in the rules.


**'Blücher or Night'**

From all of the evidences that are now part of the public record, the House bill to revise the undivided-profits tax will not afford business sufficient relief from the stifling effects of that ill-conceived measure. The undivided-profits tax has justified the gloomiest predictions of its original critics, and yet the House bill fails to take account of some of the most pertinent aspects of their criticism.

Fortunately, there is good reason for the belief that the Senate will take hold of this tax in a statesmanlike way and really come clean in revising it. Chairman Harrison of the Senate Finance Committee has forgotten more about taxes than the tax's original author in the Treasury ever knew. He has strong feelings about the undivided-profits tax, and his defeat for the leadership last year has freed him of the necessity of yielding to the Treasury's desires for face saving in this regard. Whether the Administration likes it or not, things may be expected to happen when the Senate gets to work on the tax.


**Program Notes**

If anything has become clear in the past four weeks, it is that the new New Deal has drifted into a glassy sea of inaction. But for the occasional flapping of its sails by gusts of the Jackson-Ickes variety, it might be Coleridge's painted ship upon a painted ocean. The Wage-Hour and seven TVA Bills are, for the time, forgotten. Relief debate is desultory. The real tax fight is some days off. The effort to adjust business-government relations is temporarily in a state of suspended animation. And Supreme Court reform is a battle long ago.

Other problems, chiefly foreign, preempt the news and the Congressional forum. Americans read anxiously about Europe—although no immediate situation there threatens us. But purges by blood in Russia and by edict in Germany, instability in France, indecisive bloodshed in Spain, military pageantry in Italy and grim preparations in England awaken old fears. Debate proceeds concerning our relations in the Pacific.

**NEWSWEEK**

All of this has produced a familiar shifting of the actors in public life. Active champions of the New Deal, like Senator La Follette and Professor Beard, drift into opposition to the Administration. Conservatives drift into agreement with it. The radical zealots within the Administration begin to feel the creeping chill of neglect: new figures whom they detest bask in the spotlight.

So it always is when foreign policy takes the stage. The long Gladstone-Disraeli-Chamberlain-Asquith era in English politics and the second Wilson administration in our own history remind us of that. Domestic reform ebbed and flowed: foreign policy flowed and ebbed.

Thinking men on both sides are torn by perplexity at this moment. A strong American policy in foreign affairs means to reformers the immediate slackening of public interest in their plans, but, ultimately, a greater and more concentrated governmental power over many private businesses. Conservatives also see these alternatives. All are calculating the time element, weighing the probabilities. Thus the mood of America in February 1938.

**'J'accuse'**

I am not an architect and I should hate to get into a fight with the members of this useful and esteemed profession. But since I’ve talked around the country a good deal this winter, I find myself bursting with protest against certain tendencies in school architecture.

School auditoriums, and this goes for many college auditoriums as well, are built as if the audience were perpetually expected to contemplate a sort of magnified Punch and Judy show. Standing on the high stage, a speaker is often 20 feet away from his nearest hearers. The audience extends back an almost terrifying distance. None of the interplay and personal atmosphere that tell a speaker whether he is boring or pleasing his listeners is possible. All he can do, perched on his high spot, is to shout his speech to the shadowy listeners, much as the ancient Greek actors and choruses used to shout to theirs, and wish that he had an assortment of masks, as they did, to indicate his moods and intentions in so unmistakable a manner that every spectator, even the most distant, could understand them.

Such auditoriums, of course, are made for a variety of purposes, but apparently the desire to conserve the best traditions of the theatre or make possible a friendly intimacy between performer and audience is not among them. It is a pity, considering the bricks and mortar that have gone into our educational plants, that so many of them are unsuited to the still prevalent arts of acting and public speaking.
