**PERSPECTIVE**

**Goldwater's Decision**

by Raymond Moley


IF BARRY GOLDWATER had the Presidency in mind twelve years ago when he left behind the pleasant life of a successful businessman and entered the arena of politics, the evidence fails to support it.

There have been many perennial seekers of the Presidency in our history, and certain rituals have developed which border on superstition. The successful aspirant must have a "base" in a large, pivotal state. A governorship is fine, since governors have to take few, if any, positions on national issues.

The aspirant should also have something of an organization to create an "image." He must suit his views to the shifty winds of popular opinion. If he serves in Congress, he must not oppose the President of his party. He must be an orator of sorts. And he must take himself seriously and be totally devoid of humor.

And so considered on the basis of what is called "availability," Goldwater is deficient. His "base" is a small state. He can bring from that state pathetically few delegates. He is no arm-waving, ear-splitting orator. He has grievously and, it seems, permanently offended a most popular President of his own party. In the Senate he voted almost alone against critical measures. He maintained no "image-making" staff. And he presented himself as a conservative ten years ago when that word had no repute at all.

**POPULAR DEMAND**

He also has made speeches before groups with no political potential. Many of them were young people with no votes. He made no appeal as an "intellectual." He offended powerful labor leaders. He curried favor with no special-interest minorities. And he stoutly denied being an "independent" and was a loyal Republican party man.

But somehow, through processes in public psychology that defy analysis, he has gained a massive following all over the nation. He has awakened a new and young generation to the realities of politics. College and school auditoriums have been jammed to the doors and into the streets for his talks. Goldwater clubs and, later, a vital Draft-Goldwater movement have emerged over the nation.

Inevitably, this meant a demand that he become a candidate for President. There was a wild demonstration for him at the Republican convention in 1960. He quelled this by a moving appeal to support the foreordained ticket. And during the campaign that followed, he made scores of speeches supporting the Republican candidates, even where the chances of winning were remote.

**CENTER OF HOPES**

Thus he has won the warm support not only of people generally but of Republican political leaders in a great many states. And because of his efforts, a growing two-party system has emerged in the South.

As Goldwater faced the demand that he offer himself as a candidate in 1964, grave and moving considerations must have crossed his mind. His life in Washington and at home in Arizona has been enjoyable and stimulating. He is at home in the Senate, for he deeply respects the legislative process. And there is no reason to believe that he could not continue indefinitely in the Senate.

As a candidate he must face ten months of grueling campaigning with incredible demands upon him and also the slings and arrows of bitter criticism. Beyond that, if elected, lies hand-to-hand grappling with vast, unanswered problems. The glamour and perquisites of the Presidency have little attraction for him.

But he has been and is the center of the hopes and aspirations of countless thousands of Americans. For he is the personification of a great demand for change in the Federal establishment. He believes that this movement, if it is to succeed, must be drawn within the Republican Party and win its objectives at the polls. The possibility of electing more members of Congress who share his views depends upon who is elected President. And no one who is willing to be fair, regardless of differences in party and ideology, can deny his concern for the future of his country. The values he would seek lie far beyond the possession of exalted office. These considerations are paramount.
