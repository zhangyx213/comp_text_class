**Perspective**

**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

**Power**

The Administration, it seems, is
somewhat chagrined and no little puzzled
by the recent outery over the partisan-
ship of our quasi-judicial agencies. Yet,
however astonishing the phenomenon may
be, it is by no means inexplicable. A little
scientific gumshoeing has traced it back
and linked it to the presence of a few re-
actionaries in this country—to people
who have not only read the Constitution
and the Holy Books, but who have read
them literally!

Curiously enough, these benighted folk,
these intellectual atavists who deplore the
powers and methods of some of our agen-
cies which exercise quasi-judicial power,
do not know that both the Constitution
and the New Testament have been amend-
ed. Despite the events of the past few
years, they are unaware of the facts that
the phrase "to establish justice" now reads
"to establish justice by permitting those
who think they have been treated unjust-
ly to treat others unjustly" and that the
Golden Rule according to Matthew now
reads "all things whatsoever ye believe
that men have done to you, do ye even so
to them."

They do not know that, when the AAA
and the Wagner Acts were being passed,
their pure-spirited advocates were seeking
to create not judicial agencies, in the old-
fashioned sense of the term, but militant
bodies, enforcers of "rights," friends of
the friendless, crusaders—bearing not
scales but a sword. Nor do they understand
that government has ceased to be a court
of last resort in resolving conflicts and a
conciliator of disparate purposes and be-
come a series of powerful agencies equipped
to seize powers and property back from
"predatory interests" who possess them.
In this New Era, nothing could be more
repugnant than agencies which deal a
general justice with an even hand. For it
is shaped in the belief that our system has
gone far beyond the point where general
justice is adequate and needs agencies to
take power and property from people who
have more of both than is good for them.
The philosophers of the New New Deal
have a phrase for this—"restoring the
economic balance."

Hence the argument as to whether E. S.
Smith of the NLRB or Secretary Wallace
possesses judicial temperament is quite be-
side the point.

The judicial arm of the government is
obviously the last stronghold of the archaic
conception of equal justice. Its subversive
activities have made the Administration


itself one of the oppressed groups. That is
why all loyal members of the New Order
are striving to bring the courts under their
sphere of influence. Perhaps when they do,
and there sit on the Supreme Court nine
representatives of nine interests, the great
adventure will be complete. And yet, that
in itself will mark the beginning of a new
adventure—the crusade of those who
didn't get represented among the nine.
And so will new deals rise upon old new
deals to the end of time—as the phoenix
mounts from its ashes.

Unless, perchance, we limit the clash of
interests to the legislative field—as Madi-
son and others intended that it should be
limited—and make the Administration
once more the impartial executor of law,
the emblem of our social and economic
unity, the embodiment of our transcendent
national interest.


**Fortune**

Businessmen who are able to ana-
lyze business trends with expertness will
do well to avoid pitfalls that abound in
the more shadowy field of political fore-
casting. As those who remember the Lit-
erary Digest debacle of 1936 will know,
most egregious errors in totals can come
from small misconceptions on the part of
those who test public opinion. And when
figures are mingled with editorial opinion
and interpretation the caution of the
reader must be redoubled.

Awareness of these facts should charac-
terize a reader's attitude toward an un-
signed article on "Mr. Roosevelt's Party"
in the current Fortune Magazine. The
piece begins with a deep bow to the po-
litical sagacity of Senator Guffey of
Pennsylvania, who, while the article was
in press, lost most of his reputation for
picking winners. It devotes thousands of
words to not-so-new gossip about Demo-
cratic Senators and Representatives and
concludes that "Mr. Roosevelt's party...
is still the party of Mr. Roosevelt"—which
Delphic utterance recalls Horace's satiric
"Whatever I state either will come to pass
or will not; truly the great Apollo has
given me the art of divination."

All this reminds me of the man who set
out to write an article on the weather and
ended up with a chatty piece about the
home life, eating habits and literary tastes
of the clerks in the weather bureau.

The news value in the article, duly noted
in the press last week, is that it uses a
preliminary analysis of the reliable For-
tune Quarterly Survey which indicates
that 54.7 per cent of the population ap-

prove of Mr. Roosevelt, while 34.4 disap-
prove and 10.9 don't know.

But this test must have been made
weeks ago and, when the details are pub-
lished next month, it may well be sub-
ject to a large discount. Public opinion
changes pretty rapidly in an election year
when the business index is sliding down-
ward and jobs are disappearing like stars
at sunrise. And 54.7 is a long way from
64.7—which the authors of this article
neglect to say was the proportion approv-
ing Mr. Roosevelt in the survey published
in Fortune's April issue. If the decline
has continued, Mr. Roosevelt's "majority"
is now gone.

Dr. Gallup's poll, showing a trend meas-
ured from month to month, indicated on
the first of May the continuation of a de-
cline in Mr. Roosevelt's strength which
began six months ago. That does not tell
us yet what kind of a Congress we shall
have next year. But it certainly refutes any
attempt to dismiss cavalierly the rapidly
growing insurrection in the Democratic
party.

**Fortune and Power**

It is good that Emil Ludwig's
"Roosevelt" is subtitled "A Study in For-
tune and Power," for, while it throws a
melancholy light upon Mr. Ludwig in pur-
suit of fortune and in the presence of
power, it does not shed much light upon
Mr. Roosevelt.

Employing the technique which, the
publishers say, he established in "The
Nile," Mr. Ludwig stands beside the rush-
ing torrent that had its source at Hyde
Park and achieved deltafication in Wash-
ington, and sings of its wonders.

The Egyptians used to call the Nile
"Hapy!" This newest example of "The
Nile" technique might better be called
"Happy Days Are Here Again." For after
seeing the President but a few times, Mr.
Ludwig draws a picture so ecstatic that it
must tax even the credulity of Mr. Roose-
velt himself.

Mr. Ludwig pays tribute to the splendid
books which Ernest K. Lindley has written
about Mr. Roosevelt, but his work gives
no evidence that he understood even dimly
Mr. Lindley's careful studies.

Unfortunately for Mr. Ludwig, he is
writing of a living man—not a river. The
Nile could not talk, nor could the bits
of wood that floated on its great sweep.
Not so the subject of Mr. Ludwig's present
study. The bits of flotsam that coursed
with him from Karnak to Cairo are, for
the most part, living and articulate people.
Their testimony could make Mr. Ludwig's
lyric outbursts sound like the apostrophes
of one of the Pharaohs' medicine men. Bi-
ographers do not run the risks of such
great embarrassment when they write
about the inanimate Nile or the mythical
Cleopatra or the departed Napoleon.
