**Hoarding Among the Bureaucrats**

by RAYMOND MOLEY

Among the many neuroses of the
bureaucrat is what is known in
psychopathology as the "collecting
mania." In the misty hinterland of
human life, it is common to find the
quite innocent but often symbolic
manifestations of this aberration. Psychoanalysts tell of patients who hoard
mountains of such irrelevancies as collar buttons,
pictures of pigs or mushrooms, old pocketbooks,
milk-bottle caps, and specific types of insects. A
wealthy old lady disturbed her children by her habit
of stowing away old newspapers in a safe. When one
safe was full, she would buy another, and so ad infinitum.
In answer to the physician's question, she said: "Well, every little thing
counts nowadays."

Of course, the Napoleonic achievement of the Collier brothers brought
them posthumous fame of a sort. But most of these humble collecting
folk gather unseen and die unsung. It would be unfair to draw clinical
inferences from this trait among our bureaucrats. But since they indulge
their obsession at our expense, it becomes a matter of some economic
moment.

Many of us have wondered where all the things go that are
bought by the government. It has remained for the task force of the
Hoover commission on "supply" to give us the scope, the disposition, and
the habitation of all that stuff. Our government spends $6,000,000,000
on supplies annually, of which five-sixths goes to the armed forces. We
now have stored away supplies worth $27,000,000,000. Two and a half
billion of this is an unnecessary accumulation. With proper methods of
purchasing, transportation, storage and use of supplies we could save $250,
000,000 a year.

The government makes 3,000,000 purchases a year, and half of these
are items costing less than $10. A $10 purchase costs the taxpayer another
$10 in red tape. By the time a dollar tablet or bottle of ink has reached
the place where it is used, it has cost us nearly $2.
The figures on ten selected government bureaus show that they have supplies on hand to meet their needs for
anywhere between one and 50 years. Their excess stocks average 70 per
cent of the total stock inventories.

Aside from the psychological and emotional factors involved, which only
a psychiatrist should comment upon, there are two, more material
reasons for this hoarding. The first is the fact that agencies are so incompetent
that they buy without knowing their needs. The second is their deliberate brazen
purchase of enough stuff every year so that they will not have to turn any unused
money back to the Treasury.

The old lady who stored newspapers in a safe has her counterpart immensely
magnified in the keeping of official records. The records of our bureaucracy now add
up to some 18,500,000 cubic feet. They would fill 3,080,000 four-drawer filing cabinets
worth $154,000,000. The space required for these records is equivalent to six Pentagon
Buildings. The annual rental value of such space amounts to $20,000,000. A third of the
records could be thrown away. A large part of the rest could be moved out of Washington
into idle surplus war plants.

A very important factor in this hoarding of supplies and records is that the bureaucrats seem intent on
keeping their stuff close at hand, in Washington. Perhaps this is the same protective obsession which caused the
Collier brothers to fill their house. The prime absurdity is that surplus supplies are stored in expensive Washington
space for use in field offices throughout the country.

Another Hoover report indicates that while there are many and overlapping systems of money accounts, the
government has done little to keep accurate accounting of property. Bureaucrats usually know they have bought things, but often do
not know where the things are kept. Here the figure of speech must change from psychiatry to animal life. The
squirrel is a busy animal. He collects and hoards, but cannot remember where he puts his little store. He keeps
no property accounts.
