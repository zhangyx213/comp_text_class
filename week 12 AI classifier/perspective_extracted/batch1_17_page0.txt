**PERSPECTIVE**

**CAMPAIGN AGONIES**

**BY RAYMOND MOLEY**

The public may enjoy the big show of a Presidential campaign. But among those who participate, there is more agony than ecstasy. It may not seem "constructive" to dwell upon this, since I have no remedy. It may, however, serve a purpose to suggest that unless there are changes, the quality of future Presidents will drastically decline.

The simian curiosity of people has always demanded that candidates be seen as well as heard. Before we had air transportation, public curiosity was measurably satisfied by pictures of the candidate, by his appearances in large cities and by his traveling by rail over large stretches of the Republic. In my travels with candidates this never seemed more relevant to public enlightenment than hauling a dead whale on a flatcar from town to town, or charging a fee to see a fat man or a bearded lady.

But in those quiet pastoral days before World War II the slow pace of rail travel provided time for candidates to prepare and expound reasonably satisfactory statements of the issues. It was possible, too, to limit these statements so that the press was able to present the dialogue in print for those people who could or cared to read. In 1928 and thereafter the radio helped the public enlightenment because millions could listen to the arguments in the quiet of their homes.

**THE PACE THAT KILLS**

But when air travel, especially the jet, arrived, the lure of almost unlimited exposure offered itself to candidates. The candidate could travel from coast to coast in a day, with plenty of stopovers in between. Finally, in 1960 there emerged a totally different kind of campaign. Richard Nixon visited 50 states, traveling 65,000 miles. He made 180 scheduled speeches and an equal number of unscheduled ones. There were also press conferences, television appearances, cavalcades and informal gatherings. John F. Kennedy's program was almost equally extensive.

Theodore H. White's remarkable book "The Making of the President 1960" gives us the raw details. The two candidates by late October were drained and spent—physically, mentally and emotionally. And so were their managers, speech consultants and companions.

But so far as informing the public about the issues was concerned, the "coverage" was probably less than in any earlier campaign. There were too many speeches to report and, despite endless repetitions, the press simply could not respond. White offers a vivid picture of the ordeal imposed upon the correspondents:

"And so up into the plane at 1:30 in the morning, to unwind and relax and worry about baggage and what to write about the day's events—and to talk…the tired, emotional measuring of judgments…for weeks and months they must live like tramps—shaken, rushed, fighting with police at police lines, dirty and unbathed for days on end, herded into buses like schoolboys. Physical care and handling were much alike in both revolving headquarters…But none of this meticulous, logistic care could erase the turbulent reality of reporting, the insane jet-flight quality of the 1960 campaign…men who had to combine the qualities of roustabouts and philosophers."

**IRRELEVANT TESTS**

That is what happened to public "education" that year. Measurably it happened in 1964 and it will happen again and again.

The public isn't informed. It is dazed and confused by the snatches of what it hears and reads. The time for the reflection and thought that inform decisions is denied because the show goes on to the last night.

When an incumbent President is a candidate he has certain advantages. But he must live in this world of make-believe while his grave responsibilities are neglected in his office.

Those who choose candidates in the future cannot judge aspirants by what they might do in a rational campaign or as President if elected. They must be guided by how the candidate can stand a jet-propelled campaign. Youth, vigor—the attributes of a long-distance runner—prevail. Other irrelevancies must be considered. How will he look on TV? Can his voice stand the strain? Etc., etc.

Finally, among those who might serve admirably as President there will be few who are willing to pay the price of the tortures of a campaign.
