**PERSPECTIVE**

**Los Angeles Roundup**

*by RAYMOND MOLEY*

EN ROUTE LOS ANGELES TO CHI-
CAGO—The two were not Californians,
but they were tanned with the sun of
Palm Springs. They sat uttering clichés
between gulps of their drinks as the train
moved East through Arizona. "Yeah,"
said one, "the people are apathetic."
"Yeah," answered the other, "a few
bombs dropped on 'em would help."
Stuff and nonsense. If my fellow
travelers saw apathy in California they
certainly managed to avoid going any
place where people are doing real things
and living real lives. They must have
managed, for instance, to avoid last
week's blackout in Los Angeles. I had
just asked a drug clerk for a tooth
brush. He heard something in the street.
"Blackout," he said. I never did get the
brush. The clerk went to the front of
the store, pulled the blinds and closed
the door. Somebody else turned out
lights and produced candles. Two min-
utes, and all was snug. After a time, I
slipped out into the dark street. Hun-
dreds of people were in doorways or at
the curb. Wardens were moving about
with flashlights and helmets. Auto-
mobiles had all stopped. I made a
difficult mile, frequently stopped by
wardens, up a dark Wilshire Boule-
vard. From the hotel room I could see
miles of the city with no pin point of
man-made light other than the tiny
red and green slits in the traffic signals,
almost invisible from eight stories up.
So it remained, a perfect blackout with
absolute order and calm, for almost
two hours. London or Berlin could not
have done better.

I saw no trace of apathy anywhere in
ten days on the Coast—neither on the
streets, where more soldiers and sailors
are in evidence than anywhere I have
been in the East or Middle West, nor
in the stores, nor in the great manufac-
turing plants. I saw five aircraft plants
in the Los Angeles area—incredibly huge
and dynamic. Not being Speaker Ray-
burn, I can't use production figures
without being slapped down by the
censor. But it can be said that the
production of the aircraft plants on the
Coast in 1941 increased in geometric
ratio over 1940, and that production in
1942 will again mount by geometric
ratio. The bombers, fighters, transports
and trainers endlessly rolling out on the
fields through the big plant doors are


our first line of offense. Here and there
in the plants are corners where custom
jobs are still in the creative stage. Many
of these models, far better than our
present best, will soon be in mass pro-
duction. That is our second line of
offense. In the shops and offices where
the men who are creating the designs
and directing production are working,
is our third. Out of the brains in these
shops and offices have come most of the
ideas that Germany and Japan have
stolen to create their air forces. But
those brains are inexhaustible sources
of limitless improvements. And they are
American brains.

Women are moving in increasing
numbers into the Coast aircraft plants.
Serious, sensibly dressed, they are be-
having like veterans. Everywhere, I was
told that in any task in these plants
where a woman's strength is adequate,
she can, with a little training, do the
operation faster than a man because she
is more nimble with her hands. These
women, in large part new wage earn-
ers, are on a pay-parity with men. They
and hundreds of thousands of men earn-
ing a yearly income of around $2,000
will be the chief source of retail buying
power in 1942, in view of the tax grip
on incomes over $2,500. Here, in this
group, lies a major threat of inflation.
Their buying now may be their ultimate
undoing through inflationary price rises.
This, the No. 1 problem for Congress
and the Treasury in the field of taxes,
is at long last being frankly faced in the
capital.

One over-all conclusion that
emerges from a visit to Los Angeles
needs constant reiteration. It is that
talk of removing Coast aircraft plants
inland is impractical and unnecessary.
The move would black out their pro-
duction for enough months to lose us
the war. Besides, the danger is vastly
overrated. Industry is not concentrated
in small areas in California; the distance
from the Lockheed to one of the Douglas
plants, for example, is comparable with
the distances separating many of the
great industrial cities of England. Nor
is California as near the enemy as the
East is near Europe. Los Angeles County
is about half the size of New Jersey or
Massachusetts. It is no easy mark. And
it is magnificently on the alert.
