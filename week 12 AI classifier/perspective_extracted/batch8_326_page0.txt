**Perspective**

**Peace In The United States**

"America hates war. America
hopes for peace. Therefore America ac-
tively engages in the search for peace."
Thus ended the last two major speeches
of the President.

With such sentiments no reasonable per-
son can quarrel. But it is not quibbling
to point out that there are ways to seek
for peace that neither speech suggests.
What of peace here in the United States
—peace between employers and labor,
peace within organized labor, peace be-
tween sections, peace between government
and business?

The President has rightly pointed
out again and again in the course of his
Western trip that he is the President of
all the people, not just of certain parties
or groups within the nation. But each of
his recent utterances is studded with such
expressions as the following:

"We can get along in local and state
and federal government without the serv-
ices of those who are good citizens only so
long as it does not cost their pocketbooks
anything to be good citizens." (Caspar,
Wyo., Sept. 24.)

"...the calamity-howlers and narrow-
minded stay-at-homes." (Fargo, N.D.,
Oct. 4.)

"...in respect to public affairs and na-
tional problems, the excellently educated
man and woman form the least worth-
while opinions, for the simple reason that
they have enough education to make them
think they know it all, whereas actually
their point of view is based on associations
with others who, in their geographical out-
look, at least, are about one inch wide.
'Don't talk to your banking friends or
your Chamber of Commerce friends...
but specialize on the gasoline station man,
the small restaurant keeper and the farm-
ers you meet by the wayside and your
fellow automobile travelers.'" (Herald
Tribune Forum speech, Oct. 5.)

"...enemies of democracy...the
alarms of a few who seek to regain con-
trol of American life...big manufactur-
ers...never hesitate to shut down their
own huge plants, throw men out of work,
and cut down the purchasing power of
whole communities whenever they think
they must adjust their production to an
oversupply of the goods they make. When
it is their baby who has the measles, they
call it not 'an economy of scarcity,' but

'sound business judgment.'" (Fireside
Chat, Oct. 12.)

These excerpts are less than one month's
crop. They bespeak an America at war
with itself, not an America searching for
peace. And their endless repetition, now
in one form, now in another, creates the
very discord they are intended to portray.
Their repetition does something else,
too—something else that is likely to be of
more immediate interest to the politician.
There is an inexorable law of diminishing
returns where the winning of public favor
is concerned. Theatre people and movie
producers know it—or soon have it burned
into their consciousness. The customers
get tired of the same act. The actor may
sing or dance or speak his piece just as
well as he did when he was packing them
in, but if he doesn't change his routine,
the public goes elsewhere.

One of these days, somebody is going
to capitalize on the growing weariness of
the country with the there-are-villains-
lurking-in-the-bushes-ready-to-tear-you-to-
pieces appeal. Somebody is going to cap-
ture the interest of the public by insist-
ing that life isn't a bitter war, but a proc-
ess of continuous adjustment. I still cher-
ish the hope that it will be Mr. Roosevelt,
rather than someone less conscious than
he is of the fact that a living government
must facilitate the processes of change.
But that hope has had little to sustain it
these past months.

In his speech at Chicago, Mr.
Roosevelt paraphrased a fine passage in
James Hilton's "Lost Horizon," in which
the Grand Lama of Shangri-La speaks of
"a time when men, exulting in the tech-
nique of homicide, would rage so hotly
over the world that every precious thing
would be in danger, every book and pic-
ture and harmony, every treasure gath-
ered through two milleniums, the small,
the delicate, the defenseless—all would be
lost."

But the President omitted from that
recital what follows: "Here we shall stay
...seeking such wisdom as men will need
when their passions are all spent. We have
a heritage to cherish and bequeath."

Haven't we in this country, here at
home, a heritage to cherish and bequeath—
something more precious to protect than
even books and pictures and harmonies,
—a way of life to sustain and perfect,
whatever the surge of darkness around us?
Are our energies to be dissipated blindly

NEWSWEEK

grappling with forces abroad or needless-
ly shattering our domestic tranquillity,
while we lose "such wisdom as men will
need when their passions are all spent"?
Mr. President, what of the vision of
which you have so often told us—your
vision of a friendly people achieving, in a
spirit of amity, the security of an equi-
table social order? What of peace right
here? Here is your Shangri-La!
The Holy Grail? "Behold, it is here
..."

**Congressional Probabilities**

These are general guesses as to
Congress—offered in all humility:

Before the end of the regular session,
the President will get laws dealing with
each of the five problems he discussed in
his fireside talk. But he will get what he
wants only in modified form.

Congress will pass a fairly effective farm
act, but it will be more satisfactory to
Chairman Jones of the House Committee
on Agriculture than to Secretary Wallace.

The wages and hours bill will be so com-
pletely shaped by Congressional amend-
ment that the parents of the original bill
will scarcely recognize their child.

A thin and emaciated edition of the new
seven TVA plan will be forthcoming.

The administrative reorganization legis-
lation will more nearly resemble Senator
Byrnes' joint-committee proposals than
the scheme sponsored by the President.

Mr. Roosevelt is not likely to get a sub-
servient ICC or Comptroller General.

Congress will pass fragmentary anti-
trust legislation.

In short, the President will no longer
get what he wants because he wants it.
He will get something of what he wants
because a majority of Congress is con-
vinced the people want it. Twilight is
falling on the idea of "must" legislation.
Congress' growing independence will be
evident in other ways as well. There will
be fireworks over the President's obvious
desire to play a leading role in European
and Asiatic affairs. If the business reces-
sion continues, the inflationists in Con-
gress will be in full cry demanding that
the permissive inflationary powers now
held by the President be made mandatory.
There will be a rumpus over the new tax
schedules promised by the Treasury.

The Court fight, the Black affair and
the disposition of the President to set
aside the Neutrality Act by indirection
have created deep resentment on the part
of many powerful members of the two
Houses. There is no reason to believe that
the split in the Democratic party has nar-
rowed or will narrow to any considerable
extent, unless the President refrains from
impulsive acts of retaliation when Con-
gressional opposition grows irritating to
him, as it unquestionably will.
