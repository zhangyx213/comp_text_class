**Irresponsible Power**

by Raymond Moley

DON'T believe the stories that
Walter Reuther came through
his examination before the McClellan
committee in March with flying colors.
In the persistent questioning by Sen-
ators Curtis, Goldwater, and Mundt,
laboring under incredible handicaps,
it was made clear that either Reuther
refuses to accept responsibility for the
conduct of the Kohler strike or, as he
claims, he has only slight control over
his own union. He revealed a pattern
of irresponsible unionism—power with-
out responsibility.

This pattern stood out after I had
read carefully and analyzed every
word of the 775 pages of the tran-
script for those three days—a task, I
am sure, that few have undertaken
who now conclude that Reuther won
the tilt. My space this week permits
only a general delineation of Reuther's
denial of responsibility. I shall record
later much more of what was re-
vealed, especially the most important
point of all, the unrestrained use of
UAW power in politics.

**THE SENATORS' HANDICAPS**

The handicaps encountered by the
three senators were, in part: The
availability to the three senators of
only three investigators out of the 50
to 70 employed by the committee;
the apparent indifference of the in-
vestigators, other than the three, to
Reuther's significance in the general
problem for which the committee was
created—an indifference made most
clear by the conduct of the chief
counsel, Robert Kennedy; the insist-
ence of the chief counsel on divert-
ing the course of the inquiry into
Reuther's undisputed purity in his pri-
vate finances; the resistance in the
committee to the Reuther inquiry, and
later to an attempt to have Reuther
testify after, rather than before, the
facts had been written into the rec-
ord; the contemptuous attitude of
Reuther and his counsel, Joseph L.
Rauh Jr., toward these United States
senators; the annoyance during the
hearings caused by members of
Reuther's staff who were flitting about
passing notes and comments; the par-
tisanship displayed by the majority
senators, and the inaction of Republi-
can Senator Ives, who was elected to
a large degree because he was sup-
posed to be an expert in industrial re-
lations; finally, and regrettably, the
failure of the chairman during more
than two days of the hearings to re-
strain the irrelevant oratory of the
witness and to compel him to give
specific answers to specific questions,
and his patent annoyance at the
whole course of the inquiries.

Despite all this, there was elicited
from the witness an amazing denial of
his responsibility for the conduct of
his union and of its high officers.

**UAW RESPONSIBILITY**

But the union local at Kohler was
the creature of the International
UAW of which Reuther is the head.
The International organized the local,
receives dues from it, creates the
rules under which it operates. In
the Kohler strike it spent more than
on any strike it ever had—$10 million.
It paid relief for the strikers; it paid
lawyers for defending members and
officers charged with crimes; it paid
their wages if they were in jail. But
violence and illegal mass picketing,
completely proved, were placed by
Reuther at the door of the local. He
visited Kohler only once, and then
only to make a speech.

Men responsible to Reuther, such
as Earl Mazey, secretary-treasurer
and second man in the International,
were guilty of arrogant incitements to
class feeling at the scene. This was
excused by the witness because
Mazey has "a low boiling point." He
failed to explain why International
representatives knew or were alleged
to know little of the law in a state in
which they had loosed wholesale dis-
order. Not Reuther but the authorities
in Wisconsin had to teach them the
laws governing labor disputes. Re-
spected citizens of the state, including
members of the clergy and judges,
were traduced by union officers, and
the courts were violently attacked.

For this revelation of irresponsible
power, the country is indebted to
Senators Curtis, Goldwater, and
Mundt. They also served the public
interest by bringing before the coun-
try the picture of lawlessness at
Kohler. They put this union and others
on notice that in the long run they will
be judged by what they do and not
by what they say in their propaganda.
