**Good Gulf Citizenship**

by Raymond Moley

LAST September, Archie D. Gray, senior vice president, announced that the management of the Gulf Oil Corp. had decided that the company would "take an increasingly active interest in practical politics." The precise nature of such participation would be the subject of long and careful planning. Now, after ten months of study, the Gulf plan is being presented to the tens of thousands of members of the company family and to the general public. It is a fine example for all businesses and for all Americans.

It is nonpartisan. It is educational and inspirational. It is the assumption by a big corporation of its responsibility to the civic and political life of thousands of American communities. The plan is directed toward the positive, practical awakening of employees, dealers, and stockholders to the need for individual activity in government and politics at the local level. For a wholesome political renaissance must begin in the communities, where votes are cast and public servants are elected. It cannot begin by mere appeals to representatives in Washington and state capitals who have been the beneficiaries of the special interests that are most active now. Maintaining a fair and sound government must be a citizen's do-it-yourself concern.


**REGIONAL SUPERVISORS**

To advise and assist the members of the Gulf family in local politics and civic affairs, there will be regional supervisors who will have one purpose in view: "What is good for the community is good for Gulf." These supervisors will order no one to do anything. But through them, the corporation will in its company publications give "recognition of outstanding civic and political contributions." Moreover, "in the case of an employee who undertakes a part-time civic or political responsibility which is deemed worthwhile," the supervisor will "endeavor to make arrangements" to enable him to do so. If an employee is elected to public office, a leave of absence will be considered. Gulf personnel will be urged to work with local political leaders and elected representatives. And since women are a great potential force in political life, the wives of Gulf personnel will be a part of the company's program.

To provide a two-way channel of information between local communities and their representatives in Washington, an office will be established there with two key people in charge. One will be a political analyst with contacts with members of Congress and other government officials. The other will be a political writer and public-relations representative. Through a biweekly news letter and through company publications, this office will provide information concerning vital decisions before Congress and the executive departments. It may be assumed that elected officials in Washington will be kept informed concerning the questions and opinions current in the home communities.


**NO PARTISAN POLITICS**

Regional supervisors and others will be given systematic training in public affairs, practical politics, and in the corporation's economic problems. Emphasis will be on positive rather than negative approaches.

There has been much public discussion of business in politics. The program now announced does not put a corporation into partisan politics. Rather, it seems to me a recognition of the fact that a corporation is something more than a mere mechanism to provide goods and services to the public. It is an institution created by authority of government for a public purpose. A corporation like Gulf becomes a vital part of thousands of American communities. As such, it is concerned not only with its economic interests but with all social and political affairs which affect the lives of the communities it serves. All relationships—economic, social, educational, and political—are interdependent.

American businessmen have traveled a long and stony road since 1948 when in a Presidential election tens of millions of Americans refrained from voting at all. Meanwhile, special interests who have multiplied their talents in political affairs have won victory after victory. Free institutions demand the enlistment of all talents. Business has those talents, and they should be used.
