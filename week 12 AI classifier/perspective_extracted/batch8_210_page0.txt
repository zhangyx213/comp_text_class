**Business Looks Ahead**

A crisis liquidates many delusions. This crisis is no exception. We are now seeing the unmourned end of our most prized national self-deception. That is the belief, firmly held in Washington and blazoned by government economists to the world, that recovery could come only from the artificial creation of purchasing power and from its distribution throughout the population. President Roosevelt's spending program was defeated during the summer amid the lamentations of its friends and their dire predictions of economic disaster. But within a few weeks, we began the grand whoosh of recovery. Another economic fairy tale also passes from the scene—the theory that our industrial plant was overbuilt; that capital investment, as we had always known it, was at an end; and that government, through great expenditures for public works, must take over the direction of the flow of capital. Millions of dollars of private money are beginning to pour into the replacement of run-down industrial plants.

The swiftness of the present recovery has been exceeded by only one in our experience—that of the hundred days of 1933. Its origins this time are in the old-fashioned places—the heavy industries. Its inspiration is foreign, but its volume is almost entirely domestic. It would be misleading to suggest that it has come because of the defeat of the Administration's spending program, but it does indicate that recovery does not depend solely and exclusively upon the enlargement of consumer markets. Recovery comes from a combined ability and will to spend. Here we see many wills working in the direction of recovery: the desperation of the Allies, the anxiety of South Americans and others who have formerly bought from Europe, the concern of Americans for their low stocks of goods and the lively anticipation of more jobs, more profits and more business generally. All these work together this time.

Many a business house had let its stocks get too low and its machinery become obsolete. Recollecting what happened the last time we had a war, most businessmen conclude that they had better be getting into a position where they can handle a boom if it comes. Everybody is discovering that the other fellow is doing the same thing. So the trend accelerates. People are realizing that the government is going to


The cuts in the WPA came when industry was still languishing. No problems were being solved. They were just being put off. We have a breathing spell now, and a breathing spell which is not dependent this time upon the caprice of politicians. It is a breathing spell enforced by hard circumstance.

Yet our industry's need is primarily for long-time reassurance. Under the very worst of circumstances industry would probably continue to hit upon those occasionally brilliant discoveries—those inventions and technological improvements—that have made it the wonder of the modern world. But, as everyone knows, such contributions, though stunning, have been spasmodic, relatively haphazard and unnecessarily expensive. The answer is to be found largely in those experimental plants, divisions and laboratories some of our businesses have set up for continuous development, study and planning. And a variety of governmental measures—notably the corporate surplus tax—has placed almost insuperable obstacles in the way of the more general establishment of such industrial experimental agencies. If we are to stake out new fields for the employment of labor and capital, develop new materials and processes, achieve the beginnings of stable, year-round industrial productivity, a minimum requisite is a relief from the political uncertainty that has characterized the past six years.

We already have an immense advantage over such an industrial rival as Germany—an advantage that will operate after this war even if postwar Germany is in shape to compete with us. The German industrial machine has been built primarily for war. Ours is geared for peace. This will give us the edge in the peace that must follow war, however protracted.

But we will need all the edge we've got and then some, it appears. For it's perfectly clear that the United States is facing today an unparalleled world trend toward cheaper production under a sinking standard of living. We must, here in America, either lower our own living standards or produce more and better goods more cheaply. There are no other alternatives.

The history of American enterprise to date justifies the belief that if we concentrate on the stupendous job of making our industrial machine more efficient, we can keep forging ahead. Assuming always, that is, that those who can probably do the job are given the assurance of sufficient freedom to tackle it. That is the first step the Administration can take to make America strong and safe. It is to be hoped that the promise of an adjournment of politics means this at the very least.

have its hands full for a while with the naked problem of national defense, and hence will not immediately be thinking up new methods of plaguing business. This buyers' panic is enough to give us another 1937, and it is widely believed that we shall have a business volume about equal to the peak in 1937 by the time December comes around. Some estimate that it will be hitting that pace some time in November.

Of course, it is clear that this recovery is largely replenishment of inventories and the replacement of our more immediate deficiencies of plant. Because it was touched off by the war, it must depend, to some extent, upon the course of the war. If the war should end suddenly or drag on too long, we shall have to readjust, and that might cause trouble again. But it is conceivable that this recovery will carry on to the point where underlying sources of confidence, long dormant, will come into full play—confidence, for instance, in the capacity of private enterprise to employ capital and labor profitably, to produce and distribute more goods more cheaply, to operate with reasonable stability and to devise new productive outlets for human effort.

There are healthy elements in the present situation that cannot be overlooked. The fear of overstocking and over-building, induced by the reversals of 1921 and 1929, are fresh in our minds, and businessmen are taking precautions that they never took before. In many businesses orders are being refused that might induce a business volume beyond that they regard as safe. There will be a prudent avoidance of overexpansion for the time being, at any rate. Moreover, the healthiness of business opinion is pretty well displayed in the reactions to price increases. Many makers of finished goods are doing their best to avoid them. Those who do raise prices apologize. This deference to sound economic opinion was never shown before. Finally, no one can overlook the psychological importance of the complete rout of the radical front occasioned by the unforeseen alliance between Communism and Fascism. A type of sabotage widely experienced and deeply feared has been vastly minimized, perhaps ended, by the strange reconciliation of Hitler and Stalin, the very people who would regret most profoundly this far-away incidental outcome of their pact.

We can use a recovery very well. Many a city is running out of money for relief.
