**Perspective**

**Army Over Ideology**

by Raymond Moley


The quotation which follows is an appraisal of the recent reorganization of the Soviet, written at my request by a man who speaks with the authority of intimate knowledge and long study of the Communist world and its ideologies and intrigues. For a sufficient reason, his name is withheld.

"The 1952 reorganization of the Soviet Union brought more men into the top echelon, which means that those who had the top positions before lost power. Despite appearances to the contrary, this measure must have been directed primarily against the heir apparent, Malenkov. Several years earlier, the previous heir apparent, Molotov, also was divested of some of his powers.

"Several weeks ago an announcement was made to the effect that Zhdanov had been poisoned by Jewish doctors and that sinister forces were contemplating the assassination of leading military officers. By implication this announcement meant (a) that Zhdanov's policy had been right; (b) that a return to his policy was advisable; and (c) that the military men opposed to this shift had better obey orders. Zhdanov was a man of ideological purity, the promoter of the pact of 1939, and the instigator of the aggressive policy in 1948.

"At the same time, Stalin made it a point to show himself in public. It can be deduced that after a prolonged illness during which he lost effective control, he tried to climb back into the saddle. For this purpose, he had to oppose Malenkov and also to embark on a different policy.

"Malenkov's accession to power does not constitute a simple succession. The will of the beloved, departed leader is not being implemented-and it is remarkable that no political testament has as yet made its appearance.

"The first basic change is the scrapping of last year's reorganization. If the succession had been developed with the approval of Stalin, this scarcely would have happened.

"The second basic change in the new dispensation is that, contrary to expectation, leadership is taken over by five instead of three people.

"The third basic change is the elevation of the armed forces beyond the appointment of Bulganin. Stalin always was careful to keep the army 'in its place. Now, Voroshilov becomes a President and the old labor President, Shvernik, is demoted. Zhukov, heretofore in disgrace, is given an important place. The combination of Bulganin, Voroshilov, Zhukov, Vassilyevski, and Sokolovsky is the strongest power the armed forces ever had in the government.

"Whether the other changes-the absence of a true Communist theoretician in the government and the apparent emphasis on the state to the detriment of the party-have any particular meaning is not yet discernible. These may be tied in with Malenkov's requirement of tight power control.

"If this interpretation is anywhere near accurate, it could be said that the Soviet Union under Stalin was getting ready to embark on a more aggressive policy; that Stalin died in time or was stopped; that domestically this aggressive policy would have been directed against Malenkov & Co.; that Malenkov's assumption of power probably means the abandonment of the aggressive designs for the time being, although at a later date a return to an aggressive policy is quite possible; that the position of the armed forces in the Soviet Union has been strengthened greatly, and by implication this means that the power of the party and the MVD has been reduced; and that the Soviet Government no longer includes people with very strong (or at least very explicit) ideological motivations."


The emphasis on the enlarged role of Zhukov and the Red Army is further confirmation of the views set forth last week in Newsweek's "Significance" on the new Soviet regime. It is further confirmed by Marshal Tito. Above all, it confirms the plain facts in the satellite countries. It is the Red Army and not Communist ideology that holds those countries in subjection. An idea is words, and words, as Falstaff remarked, are air. But a soldier is a man with a gun in his hands. It requires no indoctrination to understand that.
