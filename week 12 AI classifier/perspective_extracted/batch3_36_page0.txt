**A Pawn of Yalta**

by Raymond Moley

ON a bright spring day in 1945, under the guns of British tanks, 2,000 officers of General Vlasov's army were turned over to the Soviet by His Majesty's Government. Across the stony river Mur they were carried, some to death, others to years in prisons, and still others to long years of horror at slave labor. They were followed by thousands of others, many of whom were not Soviet citizens.

Once in the Soviet grip they had the grim distinction of having been prisoners under three world powers. They had been captured by the Wehrmacht, then recaptured by the Allied armies. Under the secret terms of the Yalta agreement signed by J. Stalin, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Winston Churchill, they were "repatriated" as Soviet citizens.

One of these pawns of war was N. N. Krasnov Jr. Born in czarist Russia, he was taken to Yugoslavia where he grew up as a citizen of that country. He went into captivity with his father and grandfather, a famous Cossack author and czarist general who had fought the Bolsheviks in 1918. Both were soon to die. Young Krasnov lived to tell the fearful story of his ten years' enslavement in the Soviet in a book, "The Hidden Russia" (341 pages. Henry Holt. $5).


**EAST WIND**

Krasnov's account is a chill wind from the past. It blows from the East â€”from Soviet Siberia, the frozen Russian steppes, and the Moscow of Stalin and Beria. It is also a touching, human account written by a brave and gifted man who at 42 died of a heart attack last November in Buenos Aires.

Disillusionment with the Communist system has been articulately drawn by such literary figures as Milovan Djilas. Others have described the incalculable terror and malevolent methods employed by the Cheka, NKVD, GPU, and MVD. This is a compelling account of an individual caught in the machinery of Soviet penology following the second world war. Krasnov's story unfolds with a recital of the cynicism and brutality displayed both by the British, who literally clubbed prisoners into Soviet hands, and then by the Soviet captors. Here is a detailed description of methods used in Mos-

cow's Lubianka, Lefortovo, and Bukyrki prisons which should be a primary source on the techniques of brainwashing, of breaking men in spirit, will, and resistance. The book reveals the degradation realized in the Siberian camps where thousands upon thousands were broken morally and physically, laboring to build the Marxian utopia. "Hunger that would destroy a camel" was used by the regime in those camps as a method of minimizing the possibility of successful mutinies by compelling despair.

**A PRISONER'S HOPE**

But through this grim odyssey of one man among 20 million runs a line, frayed at many places to be sure, of fundamental love of the Russian people and of hope. The regime that shackled Krasnov and depleted his strength and will was not identifiable with the Russian people. Krasnov warns the West that to fail to make this distinction is to abandon the real hope of eventual freedom throughout that vast country. The labeling of Communist imperialism as inherently Russian has already aroused suspicion of the West among the Russian people. Krasnov is emphatic in his hope that progress within Russia will work the eventual downfall of Communism.

This book should serve to point up the grievous misconceptions of the Western Allies toward the end of the war. To say that the Yalta agreement made no essential difference in the postwar isolation of Eastern Europe and parts of Asia, since the Red Army had already "liberated" or was on the verge of "liberating" what was to fall behind the Iron Curtain, is not true. This view also overlooks the fact that Yalta gave the Communists a stronger future negotiating position and indeed was construed by them as compliance or at least acquiescence by the West to their claims. The Yalta conference was a calamitous display of sloppy work on the part of both Western Powers pitted against agile, masterful maneuver by the Soviets. What has been already published reveals that Marshal Stalin was prepared, untiring, and persuasive, a striking contrast to his counterparts. Krasnov's story is a reflection of what one man suffered as a consequence.
