**Perils of Polling**

by Raymond Moley

IN EARLY September there appeared
in many newspapers a column by
Joseph Alsop datelined Seattle which
asserted that "the working-class dis-
tricts are solidly returning to their
former Democratic allegiance." This
assertion is "proved" by a poll which
Alsop and a professional pollster made
in certain blocks in "the 32nd Precinct
of the 34th District which Eisenhower
carried in 1952 by a vote of 255 to
233." This encouraged Alsop to pre-
dict that "unless the trend is changed
the precinct ought to go for Stevenson
by three to two."

I was in Seattle three weeks after
the Alsop research and learned that
an investigation was under way which
had raised serious doubts about its
authenticity. Joseph H. Lawrence,
King County Republican chairman,
now announces that his check of the
Alsop poll reveals that the blocks re-
ferred to above were not in the 32nd
Precinct but in the 33rd Precinct
which in 1952 went for Stevenson, not
Mr. Eisenhower, by a vote of 255 to
233. I have had a competent person
in Seattle check the Lawrence charge
and he asserts that Lawrence is right.
A small sample is a pretty flimsy
basis for a conclusion concerning a
great city. When the precinct is the
wrong precinct, the conclusion is
egregiously misleading. Alsop's labori-
ous exploration of what he calls the
"working class" reveals that a precinct
which was for Stevenson is for
Stevenson. That's all.

**WHO HELPED IKE?**

Despite those who would seem to
embrace the President for popularity's
sake, while they make snide refer-
ences to the Republican Party in Con-
gress, Mr. Eisenhower more and more
firmly identifies his destinies with his
party. This is in part because he real-
izes that his opposition is not only
against his party but is trying to de-
stroy him. Another reason is that he
knows that his party in Congress has
been loyal to him.

Candidate Stevenson persists in as-
serting, as he phrased it in his accept-
ance speech, that the President
"cynically coveted as a candidate but
ignored as a leader, is largely in-
debted to Democrats in Congress for
what accomplishments he can claim."


The authority for that assertion
was, according to Stevenson, the Con-
gressional Quarterly, a private com-
mercial information service. In July,
I offered a criticism of the CQ's
method of reporting party voting
which that organization at first re-
sented and later took to heart. As a
result, the CQ's summary of the 1956
session of the 84th Congress elimi-
nated at least one target of my criti-
cism. It has not counted as Democratic
loyalty to the President, instances in
which a tiny minority of Democrats
provided a "margin of victory" for the
President. But the CQ failed to go
back in the entire record of the 84th
and 83rd Congresses to eliminate
these misleading "winning margins."

IT ALSO persists in measuring support
for the President on a group of is-
sues much smaller than the real num-
ber in which the Eisenhower pro-
gram was involved. Senator Schoeppel
and Congressman Simpson inserted in
the Congressional Record of Aug. 17
and 20 a truly representative account
of Congressional voting which showed
that of all the votes cast in both
houses in both Congresses, the per-
centage of votes cast for the Presi-
dent's program by Republicans was
80.6, and that 45.7 per cent of all
Democratic votes were against him.
The President won in 75 per cent of
the party divisions in the Republican
83rd Congress and in only 41 per cent
in the Democratic 84th Congress.
The CQ's method still does grave
injustice to individual members. For
example, Democratic Majority Leader
John McCormack's "over-all support"
of the President in the 84th Congress
is listed by the CQ as 67 per cent.
Republican Congressman John Taber
is listed at 59 per cent. But on the
issues which really counted, where
the parties were divided and the
chips were down, McCormack was
89 per cent Democratic and Taber
was 84 per cent Republican. The ex-
planation of the discrepancy is that
the CQ analysis includes in "over-all
support" a good many bipartisan is-
sues and eliminates several issues in
which the parties were divided.
The President in this campaign is
loyal to his party in Congress, and his
party in Congress over the past four
years has been loyal to him.
