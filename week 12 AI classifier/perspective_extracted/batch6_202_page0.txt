**High Taxes and Hard Work**

by Raymond Moley

THERE are still old-fashioned folks
among us who believe that high
taxes discourage hard work, extra ef-
fort, more production, and hence
more income and more taxes to pay.
They agree with the tramp in the
cartoon who said: "I finally found a
way to beat the income tax and. I
haven't worked since."

But there is a school of mod-
ern economists, well repre-
sented in the Harvard
Graduate School of Busi-
ness Administration, who
are undermining this last
remaining tenet of more
primitive times. These econ-
omists hold that the exact
opposite is true.

Prof. Sumner H. Slichter,
who has his moments of
empyrean flight, puts forth
the New Thought this way: "High
taxes on profits may even be stimu-
lating rather than discouraging [to
business]

No one objects to people speculat-
ing on such things in Harvard-as long
as they stay in Harvard. When they
become policymakers in the govern-
ment of the United States, however,
their ideas become a matter of public
concern, in, this case of great concern.
Slichter's generality seems to have
been based upon a curious book,
"The Effects of Taxation on Execu-
tives," by Thomas H. Sanders, also a
Harvard Business School professor. It
was edited by Dan Throop Smith, a
professor on leave, who, when ap-
pointed to serve with Under Secre-
tary Marion B. Folsom, was an-
nounced as "responsible for analysis
and building of tax policy."

Can it be that the Administration's
insistence upon a continuation of the
iniquitous excess-profits levy was
based at least in part upon the theo-
ries of Smith who still believes the
Sanders book to be sound?

Prof. David McCord Wright, in an
address published by the National In-
dustrial Conference Board, neatly dis-
sects the book. He points out that the
conclusions of the author are "merely
a write-up, heavily edited, of a some-
what haphazard collection of inter-
views." Professor Wright also points
out that even the interviews pre-
sented by Sanders contain a good deal
of evidence that high taxes are

a deterrent on business enterprise.
In a passage where Sanders dis-
cusses the comments made by self-
made executives about their sons, he
says that said sons "are not occupied
with work, progress in business... but
with the good life, good living, and
forms of social service." Wright ob-
serves that he is "surprised that a
business school of all institutions should
release a book in which the
'good life' is in some way op-
posed to work." Of course,
Harvard will claim that
Sanders' opinions are in the
realm of academic freedom.
That might mean that peo-
ple who do not believe in
success should teach young
men how to succeed.

I would add to Wright's
criticism two further obser-
vations. The first is that this school of
economists seem to have revived a
myth which they, of all people, have
always labored to dissipate-the "eco-
nomic man." They have created a
new, economic man-this time, "the
businessman," and have tried to put
an abstraction into material form. Who
knows what predominates in the mass
of impulses that drives him to scorn
delights and live laborious days? And
who can devise a generality that fits
such a conglomerate of people?

My other observation is that once
more we see an effort to use taxation
to produce something other than reve-
nue. New Deal economists used taxes
for all sorts of things for reforming
people generally, for redistributing
wealth, for abolishing poverty, for
breaking up big business, and even
for hunting down criminals. Now comes
a new use. It is to make men work!
Material profit may not be the sole
motive that moves us. But the earned
dollar is still a measure of the value
that others put upon our efforts and
as such it is a measure of personal
achievement and personal satisfaction.

PROGRESSIVE taxation, notably in
taxes on business, is designed to
put the heaviest penalty on that last
extra effort that marks the difference
between mediocrity and excellence.
Surely, that is not the way to promote
national progress and high endeavor.
Government was not designed to de-
termine what makes men work.
