**Perspective**

**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

**Bennett Champ Clark**

Consider 1911: a Roosevelt—the
gigantic question mark after all political
calculations; a Taft—supported by conservative sentiment; a La Follette in the
Senate—a threat to complacency; a Lodge
in the Senate—too parochial for national
honors, but powerful; a Clark in Congress
—able, shrewd, independent and a serious
possibility for the Democratic nomination.
There is no strict parallel, of course,
now, in 1939. But the remembrance of
1911 recalls the immortal motto of the
Medicis. Le Temps Revient. History repeats itself, after a fashion. Situations recur,
with just enough new twists to absolve Clio from the charge of trying to palm
off the same story twice.

I don't believe people would so generally associate Bennett Champ Clark with
the name of his father if it weren't that Bennett wished it so. He adores the memory of the old Speaker of the House. The innumerable portraits and photographs of
his father that crowd his office are the smallest token of his adoration.

Not everyone is willing to put the Presidency ahead of all other objectives. There are many things that men of great spirit prefer. Clark, I am sure, would rather be remembered as a son who honored his father than as Senator or, even, as President. The two-thirds rule defeated Champ Clark in 1912. In 1936 Bennett led the fight for its abolition. It is said that he was solemnly warned that the rule that beat his father might some day nominate him. He is said to have answered that he didn't "give a damn. It's an unfair rule."

But, unlike many sons of the distinguished, Bennett does not try to honor his father by any shabby attempts at imitation. There is no aping of his way of life, his manner of speech, his political opinions. It is no disparagement of old Champ to say that Bennett's intellectual achievements have begun where his father's left off. That's as a father would want it. To give a son an honorable name, to pass on what one has learned of life and faith and disillusionment, and to see one's son become a man in his own right, an individual making his own way—who dares to hope for more?

Bennett Champ was educated as much in the Capitol at Washington as in school and college. So, when he came to the Senate, in 1933, there was no need for him to go through a silent novitiate with other freshmen senators. He knew what it was all about from the beginning. In the first Roosevelt session he spoke effectively and often. I can testify, as a constant reader of the Congressional Record, that from the running fire of debate Clark has easily emerged as one of the three or four most able senators.

During the debate, this March, on the Defense Bill, he stood on the floor day after day brilliantly analyzing technical military problems, exposing inconsistencies between the contentions of the Army and of the Navy, riddling the amateurish advices of Kennedy, Bullitt and others of our present brood of bespatted diplomats who suddenly took it into their heads to pose as powder-burned Napoleonic marshals. He tore into little bits and scattered over the Senate floor the whole pasteboard melodrama Bullitt had built around the French air mission. The frail Senatorial friends of the Administration, like Barkley, were no match for this fast-moving buzzsaw from Missouri. When less-informed men on his own side of the question faltered, he resourcefully helped them over the rough spots by asking meaty questions. It has been many a year since a senator, singlehanded, has given such a performance.

Here is no synthetic figure, ghost-ing his way to glory. Here is a man who can think and speak on his own, a hater of shams, the most recent of a long series of Missouri senators who opposed fiercely, stubbornly, the urbane substitutes for statesmanlike policy that have bamboozled the country from time to time. But in the long succession, no one since Thomas H. Benton has been abler than Bennett Clark. There seems to be something to the legend that men from Missouri have to be shown. From the beginning, Clark refused to "go along," wheel-horse fashion, on each and every Administration measure simply because it was labeled "humanitarian." Clark has gone off the reservation on several notable occasions—not because he does not sympathize with the New Deal's objectives, but because he does not believe that good objectives can be achieved through questionable means. The temporary benefit that a short cut may secure, he thinks, cannot compensate for the ultimate destruction of great values it usually involves.

That was his position on Supreme Court packing and on the Reorganization Bill. That was his attitude toward the purge. And it was one of the most enlightening aspects of the late purge that

the President scrupulously avoided a head-on collision with Clark.
There can be no doubt that the determining factor in that abstention was the knowledge of Clark's strength back home.
A year before the purge, I tried to get some notion of what the people of the states were thinking about those of their senators who had opposed the President's wishes. The answer I got from an editor in Missouri tells a lot about the state which elected and reelected Clark. "Out here in Missouri," he said, "we expect our senators to be responsible to us. We don't give a hoot about their relations with any President. That's the tradition here."

But this tradition is not the reason why Clark is independent. It is merely the fortunate circumstance that permits him to remain in office. He would be independent whether it was politically wise or not. If he were thinking merely of the next campaign, he would probably be doing what most other candidates have done in the past—talking as little as possible at this stage of the game and, when he simply had to say something, talking as ambiguously as possible. He has not done that; he is not doing it, and he is not going to do it. On foreign affairs, particularly, he has been leading the fight against those who believe we can throw our weight around in European affairs and still stay out of war.

Clark's stand on this question stems from his vivid memory of the days in which Wilson was being pulled down the road to war by his unneutral advisors. When it was all over, Clark swore a great oath that never again would he remain silent while young men gave their blood for a delusion sold to the American people by the dupes of European power politics. Now, as the old war calls are being trumpeted once more, as we are being told that we cannot stay out of a war for freedom, democracy, Western civilization, peace and what not, Clark is standing firm. He would deny not only this President, but any President, the discretionary power to decide which side in a foreign war we shall help, how and when we shall help it, and at what point intervention "short of war" will involve us in war.

This position he takes without the slightest concern about what its political consequences may be a year from now. It is possible that the interventionist propaganda, which has had a conspicuous place in Presidential utterances during the past two weeks, will capture public opinion again—just as it did, so tragically, 22 years ago. But Clark will not pussyfoot, no matter what the effect upon his political fortunes may be.
It was his father who said: "No man ever turned down a chance to be President." Bennett would rather keep this country out of war than be President of the United States.
