**PERSPECTIVE**

**After 30 Years**

by Raymond Moley

IN THIS issue, under date of Oct. 28,
1963, my subject concerns a matter
of personal privilege. Under the
date of Oct. 28, 1933, there appeared
the first issue of the magazine
*Today*. Its publisher and principal
backer was Vincent Astor. I was editor
and in that capacity I contributed a
signed article which thereafter appeared
each week. In 1937 *Today* took
over *News-Week* and assumed its
title and format. After a few
months, I relinquished the responsibility
of editor and took the title contributing
editor and continued my articles as
signed opinion.

In those 30 years I have written and
there have been published 1,556 of my
articles of opinion. The four weeks
short of 1,560 are accounted for by
statements on Federal finance appearing
in 1957 under the name of my friend,
Sen. Harry F. Byrd. Since I solicited
these from the senator, edited them, and
wrote an introduction, I believe I am
correct in claiming that I have contributed
a weekly piece without a break or vacation
for all those years. These pieces have
been prepared and filed in health and in
illness, in peace and war, in depressions
and prosperity, from wherever I happened
to be at home or abroad, come hell or high
water, without missing a week. They
concerned, for the most part, national
issues and political affairs during the
Administrations of four Presidents. This
is a sort of record for continuity, unusual
if not unequaled.

**PUBLISHING INTEGRITY**

But while I lay claim to some marks for
durability, the real credit goes to the
ownership and management of the magazines.
Until his death in 1959, Vincent Astor was
responsible as principal owner. Then for two
years Malcolm Muir exercised management
control. Two and a half years ago the late
Philip L. Graham took over the magazine for
the Washington Post Company and became
president and chief executive officer. In the
Astor-Muir years, in part under contract and
mostly by mutual unwritten agreement, the
subjects of my contributions and the opinions
expressed therein were my exclusive responsibility.
When Mr. Graham assumed control that
freedom was continued under the same terms.
I am glad to say that under these managements
no one has ever told me what subjects I should
select, what opinions I should express, or what
I should not write. Nor has any contribution
of mine been omitted. This, I submit, is evidence
of character in those who have published this
magazine. It may be unique in the publishing
world. It is a freedom of expression which is the
guarantee of the integrity of the magazine.

**PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY**

Before and during these 30 years, as a university
professor I enjoyed what is known as academic
freedom, a fine tradition in higher education. In
journalism I have enjoyed the same freedom of
expression. I stress this because of vicious charges
against the American press that it is "kept." Or
that it is dominated by advertisers. I have known
no pressure from advertisers. For advertisers that
are worth serving want their products to be displayed
in publications in which the public places its confidence
â€”no more, no less. Freedom is a two-way street.
Publishers such as those I have worked with give of
their confidence. Those who write reciprocate with a
sense of personal responsibility. As I have reviewed
the hundreds of my articles, I realize that I have often
been dull reading and imperfect in many of my conclusions.
And many, many times I have been unpopular. To take
such risks is the lot of anyone who writes opinion.

The journalist cannot be a feedback to suit the
opinions of the largest number of readers. He may excite
dissent, but he must try to win respect. He mistakes
his calling when he enters a popularity contest. There
is also virtue in the moderate expression of a point of
view. There is nothing so tragic, so bereft of influence
as a commentator with no more words to conquer. He is
ultimately rejected, alone on a peak of vituperation.
Those who write in this book are trustees. The substance
is the institution itself and the principles that guide its
operations.
