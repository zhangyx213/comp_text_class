**After 25 Years—And Six Days**
by Raymond Moley

On Oct. 28, 1933, there appeared a venture in journalism, a weekly named *Today*. Vincent Astor was principal owner. I was editor. It is quaint to call Mr. Astor "owner" at that time, because he was really a heavy contributor in what for several years proved to be a precarious investment. If there were mistakes to be made in editorial and business management, we made them. Mr. Astor's loyal support never wavered.

After three years, the magazine *NEWSWEEK* was absorbed. It, too, had its birth in 1933. We took its name and format and combined our editorial formulas. Then Malcolm Muir, president of the great and successful McGraw-Hill organization, came to us. He brought with him three McGraw-Hill associates—Sam Perinier, Ted Mueller, and Sallie Turner. Sam died in 1938; Ted, last spring. Sallie is still with us. These were dedicated people, greatly skilled in editing and publishing. Ted told me at the time he came that nothing but an audacious idealism and a drive for public service moved Mr. Muir to risk productive years and an established reputation to meet such a formidable challenge. Fortunately for all of us, it was for him another dawn "risen at mid-noon." In a very few years we turned the corner.

**NEW FORMULA**
The *NEWSWEEK* formula broke new ground in the field. The news, national and worldwide, was to be presented fairly, impartially, and with scrupulous accuracy, together with its significance and meaning.  There were signed columns of opinion. The great tradition of journalism has been public service through the presentation of the news, plus leadership through editorial opinion. *NEWSWEEK*'s formula was a variation of that: News, plus opinion signed by qualified and responsible contributing editors speaking for themselves.

In the exercise of my privilege, which I believe to be unique, I wish to pay a tribute to Mr. Astor and Mr. Muir. Never, during these many years of association, has either of them told me what to write, what not to write, or what line or philosophy to follow. My record of continuity at this mile-post I offer here with gratitude to a kind Providence and to my associates. I have never missed a weekly contribution in those 25 years, except in 1957 when I was honored by Sen. Harry F. Byrd, who took over during four weeks. There have been about 1,300 of these compositions of mine. A word, for what it may be worth, about method. The fact that I came to this profession from academic life was an advantage, but also a handicap.


more readers but imposed upon the writer more care, more exactness, and much, much more labor.

When, amid the rushing course of change, so many subjects are available, my rule, posted over my desk, is: "Is it true? Is it important? What does it mean? What do I think about it?" Understatement is a virtue, but it need not be pallid neutrality. I also have, over my desk, this quotation: "There comes a time when silence is not golden—just yellow." I am concerned with what ought to be, not what I expect will happen. I could not in conscience tarnish the priceless privilege of free expression by avoiding an unpopular point of view. Nor permit frankness to lose its luster by dodging a controversial issue. To lose a battle is merely an incident in the day's work. But I have faith in the nation's future. A cynic has no influence and a pessimist no friends.

**SHADOWS, SUBSTANCE**
There is nothing in life so tragic, so bereft of influence, as the commentator with no more words to conquer. There he is, lonely in a pit of vituperation. I draw inspiration as well as many a chuckle from my colleague, John Lardner. I wish I could write like that. But John, like his great father, Ring, is inimitable.

I am fortunate to be able to write this personal note. Happy is the man who may write his own epitaph. But this is neither an epitaph nor a valedictory. It is, Providence and my colleagues willing, a pause on a longer road. I anticipate another stretch of years, busy with these "brief chronicles of the time."

But those of us who fashion this book are, after all, the shadows. The institution is the substance. We are trustees not only of the past but of a future in a fiercely competitive world. What we have is an inalienable trust, never to neglect, to diminish, nor to lose. It belongs to those ahead, who will labor here and who will read what *NEWSWEEK* can offer them in years to come.

*Newsweek*, November 3, 1958
