**Perspective**

**Phony Campaigning**

What kind of campaign is this, anyway, that the Third Term party is waging? The President, of course, is too busy for politics. He has therefore been obliged to limit himself in the past two weeks to one "inspection tour" of the upstate New York communities where Republican majorities are heavy; to one "inspection tour" of Pennsylvania and Ohio, from which reports of Willkie gains have come; and to a speech designed as a direct reply to criticisms of his defense efforts.

While he has been so engaged, his political shock troops have publicly devoted themselves almost exclusively to being "shocked" about this or that. One of the colleagues of Boss Frank Hague, the Vice Chairman of the Democratic National Committee, is "thoroughly shocked by Mr. Willkie's conduct in Jersey City..." Attorney General Jackson, between explanations of his remarks on the NLRB and defense, is shocked because Mr. Willkie cusses and swears in the presence of workmen. In the course of a day which brings the announcement that the Democratic National Committee is buying $100,000 worth of radio time on election eve, Mr. Edward J. Flynn, Chairman of the Democratic National Committee, is shocked because, he says, the Republicans are trying to "buy" the election. But Mr. Flynn is also shocked at a publication of the Colored Division of his own Democratic National Committee which likens Willkie's political rise to Hitler's in Germany, quotes Hitler's "Mein Kampf" as saying that "Negroes are lower than apes" and charges that Mr. Willkie's "whole background is German." It's been a great two weeks for "shocks" like these.

Meantime, the President finds time to receive so many political leaders abroad his "nonpolitical" inspection train that an extra car must be taken on. The accurate commentator, Fulton Lewis Jr., reports that Mr. Roosevelt spent only seventeen minutes "inspecting" the huge Mesta Machine Co. plant and only twenty-one minutes "inspecting" the vast Carnegie-Illinois Corp. plant at Homestead. Mr. Roosevelt discusses with Mr. Ickes a political speech Mr. Ickes makes in Akron, Ohio. Mr. Corcoran injures his head on the dome light of a car belonging to the City of New York. And there is a crisis in our relations with Japan.

Thus the news from the Third Term front—a tableau of attempted political indifference rudely marred by the run-nings-about of the stagehands and the nervous twitchings of the extras. Small wonder, then, that the Third Term campaign which consists of posing that it isn't a campaign, nevertheless reveals so many inconsistencies. The campaign is neither what it seems to be nor what its leaders say it is. The New Deal is neither conducting a campaign as a campaign should be conducted, nor is it ignoring the fact that a campaign exists. Its drive for votes is a potpourri of make-believe, cynicism, hypocrisy, overconfidence and indecision, revealing all the weaknesses that may well precede a violent revulsion of feeling on the part of the public.


Consider for a moment the third-term issue, which, according to a Gallup Poll, is the main reason why many who voted for Roosevelt in 1936 have decided to vote against him this year. The issue of the perpetuation of a President in office is as profound an issue as has ever confronted the American people. It is unnecessary to argue it here, except merely to state once more that it involves a basic change in our constitutional system—a change which may very well spell the end of republican government in anything except name in our generation.

The opposition to a third term has been stated again and again by men whose sincerity, truthfulness and scholarship are unquestioned. But those who propose to destroy this traditional principle have cynically ignored it or are sneeringly minimizing its importance. At the Chicago convention it was avoided by the platform, by the stooges who spoke for the Administration, and by the President himself in his acceptance speech. An Administration with dozens of men who have never been especially retiring or inarticulate has maintained a blank silence on the issue, broken only by an occasional quack from Mr. Ickes.

The only seemingly authoritative statements of the New Deal on the subject of the third term are two small pamphlets. The first is a conglomeration of not very relevant quotations which appears under the name of Mr. Ickes. It purports to be an anthology of quotations on the third term. But its omission of pertinent quotations from Jefferson and Jackson is so glaring that one can understand why it does not bear the imprimatur of the Democratic National Committee or of the President.  The second statement is a limp folder of eight pages published under the imprint of the Democratic National Committee. This document deserves at least a passing comment, for it contains two strange and significant items. The first is a quotation from Jefferson in which Jefferson said that the only consideration that would ever permit him to run for a third term would be a situation in which a monarchist might be brought in otherwise. The anonymous author of this pamphlet adds parenthetically, after the word "monarchist," the words: "Fascist in his day." The implication, then, is that Mr. Roosevelt is running to prevent a Fascist from becoming President.

This is interesting indeed. What is the name of the Fascist in our midst whom only Mr. Roosevelt can keep out of the White House? Is this remark a smear or a slip or just a piece of plain dumbness? It is, in any case, a challenge to the good faith of every voter who believes that there are other ways of filling the Presidency than by filling it with Mr. Roosevelt. Perhaps it can be explained by the crass cynicism that characterizes another part of this pamphlet. Here the third-term tradition, cherished by Jefferson, by so many of the Presidents who succeeded him and by millions of American citizens, is called just a "phony precedent." Thus, contemptuously, the New Deal refuses to justify its position to reasonable people. This "phony precedent" crack is the lineal descendant of Boss William Marcy Tweed's infamous "As long as I count the votes what are you going to do about it?"

When President Roosevelt has set about it, in the past, he has been able to make a dignified and at least a plausible case for himself in public debate. In this autumn of 1940 he owes it to himself, to what remains of his party, to his Administration, to the American people and to the position of the United States in the world to lift his campaign above this sordid level of pose and ward politics. The effect of his silence on the major issues is, inevitably, to drive his campaign into the byways of race prejudice and scurrilous misrepresentation.

Mr. Roosevelt has been challenged by a responsible opposition. Mr. Willkie has conducted his campaign with sincerity, earnestness and intelligence. The public is waiting for the answers to Mr. Willkie's questions. Mr. Roosevelt is unable to maintain the pretense that the public is not entitled to those answers—entitled to them long before the $100,000 worth of broadcasting on election eve. It is not the third-term tradition that is "phoney." It is the Third Term campaign sub silentio that's the phony.
