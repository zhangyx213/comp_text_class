**Running for President**

*by Raymond Moley*

"ANYONE who wants to run against
John F. Kennedy," Richard M.
Nixon said in Paris, "would have to
have a hole in his head if he didn't
start now to build up a staff, especially a research staff."

That fact about any candidate for
a Presidential nomination, unless he
is already in the White House anticipating a second term, seems to be
overlooked by those people who are
speculating about a draft for Nixon
or the nomination of someone other
than Goldwater or Rockefeller. The
fact that Nixon has no such staff, has
no intention of forming one, suffices to
dispose of silly talk about a draft next
summer. And he has a firm commitment to the business of his law firm.

Rockefeller has had a large and expensive staff of experts since he first
ran for governor in 1958, and Goldwater is assembling one now. For under modern conditions, preparations
for running for President must be
made months before the first primary.
Gone are those pastoral days in the
nineteenth century when a man
chosen in a howling, disorderly convention could go forth and hope to
end in the White House. He left it to
the national committee of his party,
with a chairman chosen by him after
his nomination, to scrounge for votes
while he remained at home most of
the time and greeted delegations of
citizens from his front porch.


**THE EARLY DAYS**

Two changes appeared in politics
in the 1890s. Mark Hanna, probably
the greatest political organizer in
modern times, had been building an
organization for his friend William
McKinley for more than four years
before the convention in 1896. His
objective was to get the pledges of
prospective delegates and then, after
the convention, to use his supporters
in the states to mobilize voters. The
Republican National Committee, of
which he was chairman, was only one
of the organizational tools which
Hanna used to win the election. McKinley had been in Congress for years
and had his speeches all memorized.
Faced by this organization, William
Jennings Bryan adopted another
innovation. He took to the hustings
and traveled over the states from
place to place expounding the principles of free silver. He had little personal equipmentâ€”an alpaca coat, a
Prince Albert, a change or so of linen,
and an assistant or two to care for
railroad tickets and to meet the press.

When radio appeared and newspaper coverage of a campaign was
greatly increased, it became necessary for the candidate to seek much
greater variety in his speeches. This
brought about another innovation in
Franklin D. Roosevelt's campaign for
the nomination and election in 1932.
His organization was largely personal
because the Democratic National
Committee prior to his nomination
had been organized by Governor
Smith's supporters.

**FDR'S INNOVATIONS**

While Roosevelt left something to
be desired as an administrator when
he was President, he was a master at
political organization. Hence, he divided his staff into two parts. On the
one hand were the people charged
with mustering delegates before the
convention and votes afterward. On
the other hand there was the group
subsequently called the Brain Trust.
This group was exclusively concerned
with the policies and issues which
were to be presented in speeches
and statements by the candidate.

Each group reported to Roosevelt
directly and had few contacts one
with the other. To mix them would
have brought about utter confusion.
This sharp division of function remains one of the imperative necessities for success in a campaign.

Another principle relates to the
operation of the group concerned
with policy. To succeed, its head
must be the sole contact with the
candidate. There can be several experts concerned with the various issues before the country. But they
should submit their ideas and facts in
writing to their chief, who then works
with the candidate in formulating
speeches. Speeches cannot be written
by a committee or group.

Violations of these principles explain the failure of certain Republican
candidates in elections since 1936.
Without organization, a candidate is a
voice in the wilderness. And there
are no votes in the wilderness.
