**The Seventy-Eighth Congress**

**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

To say that the Seventy-Eighth
Congress will be more independent than
the last is not enough. This session may
mark the beginning of a new dispensa-
tion in government. Certainly executive-
legislative relations will not in our time
be what they have been over the past
ten years. The changes will be many,
important, and, over all, for the better.

To see how different this new Con-
gress will be, we shall have to look back
a bit. In 1933, during the well-remem-
bered Hundred Days session, the Presi-
dent was new. Except for a few leaders,
Congress was new, too. As soon as the
new government took office in March,
the economic index turned upward.
Whatever was done by Congress and
the Administration was done to the tune
of a reviving country. There were no
sharp orders from the Executive to
Congress in those days, although legis-
lation, by common consent, originated
on the executive side. That day seemed
lost when the "low descending sun" did
not see an executive message or piece
of legislation appear in the record. It
was an era of good feeling and, it should
be added with emphasis, an era of mu-
tual respect between the two branches
of government.

I can speak with some assurance
when I underline the statement that
those members of the Administration
whose duty it was to work with Con-
gress approached that august body with
respect. There was an occasional im-
pertinence by some of us, of course. A
resounding cuff on the ear was the
response when that happened. People
didn't tell Joe Robinson what to do or
what not to do. At least, they never
tried it twice, for there were traditions
of Congressional power too strong to
flout.

But over the years after 1933, those
traditions were less and less invoked.
Messengers of various sorts scuttled
back and forth between the Executive
Offices and the Hill. The leaders of the
majority, not the minority, were sum-
moned to the White House and usually
pleasantly, but always firmly, given
marching orders.

The same leaders will be on deck in
the Seventy-Eighth Congress. But the
President will find them changed men.
It is a curious fact that in dealing with
the President, a Speaker with a major-
ity of a dozen is stronger than a Speaker
with a majority of a hundred or more.
Mr. Rayburn can now tell the President
what legislation he can and cannot get
through. As his freedom from Presi-
dential domination becomes more ap-
parent, his influence on both sides of
the House will increase. Mr. Rayburn's
reported statement that "this Congress
won't take legislation written by men
who not only were never elected to
Congress but never ran for office" is of
great importance. This is not the Ray-
burn of the past few years talking. This
is the Texan whose thirty years in the
House have implanted deep in him a
sense of Congress's ancient dignity.

Since Mr. Martin shares that tradi-
tion, there will be genuine cooperation,
despite political difference. We may
never have a coalition government, but
this will most certainly be a coalition
Congress. Bureaucracy is going to be
a fighting word in the vocabulary of
both sides of the House. Tax bills will
be written in Congress and expenditures
scrutinized there. Many an alphabetical
agency will be roughly mauled; Presi-
dential appointments will not always
get approval; and blank-check appro-
priations will be fewer.

But none of this means, as some
observers here and abroad apparently
fear, that the new Congress will prove
to be anti-Administration to the point
of impairing the war effort. No member
of Congress, in fact no sane American,
believes that blood or money can be
saved by lessening the war effort. The
contrary is true. Congress is more likely
than the Administration to catch the
general impulse of the nation to fight
fast and hard and get it over. Rayburn
and Martin join in naming this the
"Victory Congress."

Under his present powers, constitu-
tional and statutory, the President con-
trols foreign policy. Beyond the actual
making of treaties, not even the Senate
can check him. So the issue of foreign
policy will be unimportant in Congress
this year. Debate on postwar arrange-
ments is unlikely before 1944, toward
the end of this Congress.

The fact is that never in his ten years
of power has the President been in a
better position to establish an agreeable
working relationship with Congress. All
he needs to do is to recognize the con-
stitutional equality of the legislative
branch. Perhaps he is reconciled to this.
It was an omen, pleasant but possibly
of no moment, that the President had
a little birthday party for the Speaker
to which he invited not only the Re-
publican leaders but such unrecon-
structed anti-New Deal Democrats as
Gene Cox. The President gave Rayburn
a new hat, in which, it is hoped, no cob-
blestone was secreted.
