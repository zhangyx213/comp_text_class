**Clearing It With Sidney**

**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

Denverâ€”There is almost as much interest in Sidney Hillman's PAC in the Midwestern states as there is in the Democratic party. In fact, in cities like Cleveland, Detroit and Milwaukee the Hillman machine seems to be a more vital political force than the Democratic organization. In Chicago Kelly's juggernaut dominates but respects the PAC. In Republican circles there is a firm determination to nail the red banner on the fourth-term masthead. Governor Bricker's attack on Mr. Hillman in his acceptance speech is only a sample of things to come.

In New York I heard regrets about this concentration of fire on Mr. Hillman. But the answer to these regrets is that if this politico-labor committee becomes the hottest issue in this campaign, there is no one to blame but Messrs. Hillman and Murray. They asked for it. The Hillman strategy since 1936 has been directed toward putting the leftist side of the labor movement into a dominant position in the Democratic party.

No one with whom I have talked takes seriously the pretense that the PAC is nonpartisan. The way to judge the partisan, political character of an organization is to consider not what it says, but what it does. The PAC participates in the nomination of candidates. That was proved at the Democratic convention in Chicago. Whether Mr. Roosevelt actually said, "Clear it with Sidney," is not important. His directives to his leaders in the convention meant exactly that. The PAC solicits and collects campaign contributions. It spends its money on propaganda for candidates. It gets voters registered and will see that they vote. Its leaders make political speeches. What, it may be asked, does a political party do that Mr. Hillman's organization does not do?

Charges of Communist influence in the PAC will be made repeatedly and they will be effective. But it seems to me that the question whether this or that Communist is working for Mr. Hillman is not the issue. The real issue is the projection into American national politics of an organization, based upon a single economic group, whose purpose is the control of a major American political party and whose position in the national government, if this campaign succeeds, will be immensely powerful.

Moreover, the tactics of Mr. Hillman in his relations with the Democratic party, as well as in his previous relations with the American Labor Party in New York, follow a line quite foreign to the traditions of American politics. Those methods are best described by a former political associate of Mr. Hillman, Louis Waldman, in his moving and informative book "Labor Lawyer." Mr. Waldman knows his stuff from firsthand experience. For many years he has been in a legal capacity very closely related to Mr. Hillman's Amalgamated Clothing Workers. He still is counsel for the Joint Board of the Amalgamated.

The technique described by Mr. Waldman is now routine. A minority group, well organized and clear in its objectives, gets itself into the inner workings of a big organization by pushing a few persons here and there into committees and minor offices. Then these patrols push farther and make room for a few more. They seek, by persistence and skill, to get their language into official expressions and rules of the big organization. Finally, the big body finds itself captured from within. No doubt, this is what is going to happen to the Democratic party. Already there is evidence that such an invasion is taking place. Democratic organizations throughout the Midwest are apathetic and lazy. The PAC is quietly taking over their intimate contacts with the voters.

The present Democratic party is especially vulnerable to such an invasion. The top officers of the party in many states, as well as the major officials in the Administration and in Congress, have been carrying a heavy official load for a long time. Despite their public protests, they are tired. The state organizations throughout the country are growing weaker every day, especially since so many states have Republican administrations. The Democratic National Chairman is neither experienced nor particularly able.

Wise Democrats know all this. They privately express great fear of Mr. Hillman. And their fears are amply justified by the facts.
