Pork, Unlimited

-by Raymond Moley

Two weeks ago the Senate passed
a Colorado River storage project.
Voting for it were senators represent-
ing the massive special interests of
sixteen of the reclamation states, of
the states getting gravy for irrigation
and flood control in the Missouri Val-
ley and other Western areas, the five
states on the west bank of the Missis-
sippi concerned with flood control and
river development, and one
Great Lakes state which
got its St. Lawrence Sea-
way. Representing Phineas
Phorgotten Squeez, the
American taxpayer, was a
scattering of senators mostly
from east of the Mississippi.

Here are some incontro-
vertible facts about this bill,
and neither the piety of
Watkins nor the wit of
O'Mahoney shall cancel half a line:
►An Incredible Bill: A year ago I crit-
icized in a number of articles in this
magazine the 1954 version of the
plan, which was born in the wedlock
of the Bureau of Reclamation with
politicians from four mountain states
and blessed by an Administration in-
terested in keeping Western Republi-
cans in office. The 1954 model was
priced at about $900 million. The one
now passed by the Senate has a tag of
$1,658,000,000. In both cases Phineas
P. must pay hidden interest charges
amounting to two and a half times the
cost. And remember, Bureau of Recla-
mation actual costs have traditionally
been two to four times its estimates.
The 1954 model would have author-
ized two major power dams and
eleven irrigation and storage projects.
The 1955 bill contains five power
dams and 33 irrigation and storage
schemes. This mammoth spending
plan will, if passed, probably cost
ultimately between five and seven
billions. When T.R. started reclama-
tion in 1902, projects were to pay
out in ten years. This one will run
75 or more.

►Unnecessary Irrigated Acreage:
Senator Douglas said in his masterful
speech against the bill that there
could not be found in the whole, wide
nation land less suitable for cultiva-
tion. Not only would such arid land be
grievously wasteful of water, but
when watered its product would be
mainly alfalfa, hay, and some corn.
And since it lies in very high altitudes,
it would have short growing seasons.
Therefore, it cannot be compared
with the successful Imperial and Salt
River projects in California and Ari-
zona. Phineas P. is already stuck for
subsidies on surplus food and fiber to
the extent of $8 billion. The Depart-
ment of Agriculture experts say that
we shall have surpluses for years to
come and that by 1975 sci-
entific progress will supply
the population with a meas-
urably small increase in cul-
tivated acreage. Moreover,
if we need new land, there
are 20 million acres east of
the Mississippi and in Okla-
homa and Texas which can
be prepared for cultivation
at an average cost of $100
an acre. The construction
cost on the 1955 project would aver-
age $1,000 an acre, but since the
repayment period would run 75 years
or more, the hidden interest cost
would be $5,000 an acre.

►Excessive Power Costs: Senator
Douglas cannot be accused of hostility
to public power or to hydropower. He
said that the cost of producing power
on the Tennessee is 1.1 mill per kilo-
watt, and 1 mill on the Columbia.
Power from coal can be produced for
less than 4 mills. The plans in this bill
call for power production costs of
about 4½ mills at Glen Canyon and 6
mills at Echo Park. This bill actually
assumes in its alleged payout plan
that 6 mills can be charged for 75 to
100 years. And the region has enor-
mous unused coal and shale oil for
power production. It also has a lot of
uranium. If power is to be sold com-
petitively in such a region, it will have
to be below cost, and that means a
subsidy for power as well as irrigation.
This knocks into pieces the already
rickety financial plans for the project.

►Hoover By-passed: The Hoover
commission already has a task force
report on reclamation. The commis-
sion itself will report about June 1.
The Senate and the Administration
have now ignored, affronted, and
frustrated the commission which they
piously created two years ago.
Phineas P., the little man who pays
the bill, has two hopes left: His House
of Representatives, and his own ca-
pacity to complain.
