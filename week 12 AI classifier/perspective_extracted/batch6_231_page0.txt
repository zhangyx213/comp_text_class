**The End of a Blind Trail**

by Raymond Moley

THE precise policies which the new
President and his Secretary of
State propose to substitute for the
Truman-Acheson policy of contain-
ment are not yet clear. Perhaps they
should never be spelled out because
such disclosure would be fatal to suc-
cess. It is clear, however, that con-
tainment as a policy has measurably
been abandoned by the Administra-
tion. This is good news.

Two principal assumptions
behind the policy of
containment are critically
examined in a new book,
"Containment Or Liberation?" by
James Burnham, whose previous
effort on the same subject, "The
Coming Defeat of Communism," has
had no little influence in shaping the
thinking of Republican critics of the
Truman-Acheson diplomacy.

The first of these assumptions was
that Communism is the product of ad-
verse economic conditions. The adoption of this theory by the statesmen of
the New and Fair Deals was to a degree
the result of its wide acceptance over
the past generation in our educational
system and generally among our self-
styled intellectuals. It was the translation into world diplomacy of
President Truman's conviction that the
key to politics is material benefits and
that our foreign peril is what he called
"stomach Communism." This, of
course, is economic determinism, a
cardinal principle of Marxian thought.
It is ironical that over the years while
this ugly, dangerous, and deceptive
half-truth has been eagerly adopted by
American politicians it has largely been
abandoned by the cynical masters of
the Soviet.

While it cannot be denied that desperately poor conditions can provide some
opportunity for subversion, the fact is
that the apparatus of Communism, as
we well know, can operate at any
economic level. We have as proof revelation after revelation of Communism
among our well-to-do, in our colleges,
and among the well-kept denizens of
Hollywood. Of course, some of our
well-heeled Communists will claim that
they are moved by sympathy for the
underprivileged. But that assertion itself
is a part of the trickery of Communism.
We can assume that the same thirst for
power or adventure moves them that
induced Lenin and Stalin to choose
poverty over years of revolution in order
to destroy those whom they hated. This
doctrine of economic determinism suggests that we can merely buy our way out
of our perils when in reality we need
sharp intelligence, countersubversion,
courage, and determination.

It is fantastic that the same people who
have shown such naïve belief in economic
determinism should also have promoted
propaganda designed to show the world
how rich we are. My colleague, Harry
Kern, says that our foreign policy has
been largely based on the belief that
everybody loves a fat man. Burnham
puts it this way:

"The curious assumption seems to be
that others will love us if they see us as
we really are. And why? The only
evident reason is that they won't be
able to help loving us because we so
want to be loved. In their ardent
youth, Americans have not yet learned
the tragic lesson that the most powerful
cannot be loved—hated, envied, feared,
obeyed, respected, even honored perhaps,
but not loved ...

In the late summer of 1952, Moslem
pilgrims piled up in Beirut on the way
to Mecca. The United States ran a
'Magic Carpet' of airplanes to transport
thousands of them free and comfortably.
Undoubtedly this was done on the inspiration of one of the psychological
warriors ...

"Islam teaches that all things, good and
bad, come from Allah. The planes that
took the pilgrims to Mecca appeared and
functioned by and solely by the will of
Allah. For that, the pilgrims no doubt
gave due praise to Allah. It would have
been sacrilegious and indeed unthinkable
for them to feel thanks, gratitude, or
obligation toward the American pilots,
generals, or diplomats. These were the
instrument that Allah happened to choose."

IF ALLAH is great and Mohammed is his prophet, where does Uncle Sam fit in?
Certainly, the way to win the hearts of the poor of the world is not to boast about our
own wealth and well-being.
