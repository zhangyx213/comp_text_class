**PERSPECTIVE**

**U.S. PATENT POLICY**

**BY RAYMOND MOLEY**

A long, bitter and inconclusive issue over the rights to inventions made in research and development financed by the Federal government will come to a head in the 1966 session of Congress. For Sen. Russell Long has been laboring for years to have the government retain such rights. In eleven instances he has been able to attach amendments to specific bills asserting the government's rights. Last year he introduced a comprehensive bill which he will press upon the Senate this year. This bill would give the government exclusive rights to all such inventions at time of contract, with the exception that the government might waive such title to identified inventions, but under nearly impossible conditions. It goes further and provides for a Federal Inventions Administration to develop such inventions and promote their widespread use.

Long's argument has that sort of surface plausibility which commends it to the uninformed. For he claims that since the taxpaying public has paid for the research that produced the inventions, the public should have the rewards.

But such a bill would drive the ax of government into a very complex set of private rights and conditions. In many instances it would not serve the public interest at all, but would make it more difficult for the public to enjoy the benefit of science, research, invention and discovery.

**REWARDS FOR INVENTIONS**

The rights of the contracting company which supplied the managerial know-how and recruited and directed the scientists and technicians are to be considered. Very often the company has pooled its technical resources in such operations, and thus it is difficult to know whether the invention actually came from the government contract. The company may already have prior patent rights involved in the new invention.

There are also the individuals whose brains and experience have produced the invention. In giving rewards for inventions and discoveries, it must generally be recognized that most such developments come from more than one person working on a project. The helpers as well as the department head deserve credit. Motive is a paramount consideration. The company's motive is to make a legitimate profit. The motives of the individual inventors are the sheer joy of creation, the credit and public notice and their deserved pecuniary reward.

In some big companies, contracts of employment with scientists and technicians provide that all rights to inventions go to the employer and that no employee may take out a patent on something which was developed on the company's time. More enlightened company practice, however, is to give the individual inventor a share in the profits.

**KENNEDY GUIDELINES**

In the past, agencies of government have followed various rules in making contracts. But in 1963 President Kennedy stated certain guidelines to be followed. He asserted the public interest in all government-supported operations. But he also stated that where a contractor "has an established non-governmental commercial position and where there is greater likelihood that the invention would be worked [out] and put into civilian use than would be the case if the invention were made more freely available," the contractor should have exclusive rights.

Senator McClellan has a bill which would recognize this distinction. It would recognize the government's rights to inventions or discoveries which would have an enormous impact upon the public welfare or to a device usable only in military operations. But beyond such exceptions the contractor's and the individual's rights would prevail.

In any commercial product there is a wide gap between the invention or discovery and the marketing of the product. Unless there is a profit motive for the investment of the necessary capital-and this may involve great risk-the product may not reach the public at all. And if such a bind is imposed as Long proposes, certain contracts may not be accepted. Or inventors or companies might not disclose what they invent or discover by applying for a patent. In such cases, the public interest would be very poorly served indeed.
