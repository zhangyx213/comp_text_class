**Will the Farmers Defeat Ike?**

by Raymond Moley


IN RECENT weeks, in two notable
NEWSWEEK polls, editors over the
country have discounted the ef-
fect of farm discontent upon the
Eisenhower vote this year. The facts
bear out their estimates.

In the first place, the so-called
"farm vote" is neither easily identi-
fied nor large. It is complicated and
influenced by many factors other than
the price of commodities.

Since 1940 the farm popu-
lation has declined at a pre-
cipitous rate. It was 23
per cent then, 16 per
cent in 1950, and 13 per
cent in 1955.

It numbers 21.7 million.
But the Republicans need
worry but little about the 44
per cent in twelve South-
ern states. Of the 12 million
in the rest of the country, perhaps 8
million are in Republican families.
Only 5.3 million of these are old
enough to vote, and judging by the
past, only 3 million will vote. Reports
show that Eisenhower may lose only
about 25 per cent of his 1952 support.
Thus the possible loss will be only
750,000, scattered over 36 states.

The great dispersion of the popu-
lation in recent years by automobiles
and good roads and also by the de-
centralization of industry has moved
into rural areas (not in towns) many
nonfarm people. These outnumber
those living on farms 36,276,000 to
21.7 million. The rural nonfarm popu-
lation in Ohio, for example, is double
the number living farms.

Critics of the President use figures
showing a decline of farm income.
They fail to tell you that while the
pie is getting smaller, there are fewer
people to share it. There were 5.7
million farms in 1949, and there were
5 million in 1955. Agricultural em-
ployment in 1949 was 8,026,000; in
1955 it was 5,635,000.

Three great classes of farmers re-
ceived more income in 1955 than in
1954. These were cotton farmers in
the Southern Piedmont region, dairy
farmers in the Central Northeast, and
wheat-small grain-livestock farms in
the Northern plains. It has been in the
Western Corn Belt that drought and
falling hog prices have caused distress.
It should be added that with an
expanding economy many farmers


have added income from nonfarm
sources such as various kinds of part-
time employment for themselves and
members of their families.

At this point, however, it is sug-
gested by those who regard the farm
problem as politically decisive that
Eisenhower will lose not only the
votes of farmers but the votes of those
in towns and small cities in agricul-
tural regions who trade with
farmers. This is the old
William Jennings Bryan ar-
gument about grass growing
in the streets of cities, etc.

It fails to note the vast
changes in our economy
since 1896 or, indeed, since
the Dewey disaster in 1948.

With a greater variety of
goods and services now re-
garded as necessities, towns
and cities to a large degree generate
their own economic life. It is no longer
merely storekeepers selling to farmers
and farmers selling raw materials.
Moreover, spending on farm equip-
ment and construction has declined
considerably less than farm income.
It was $4 billion in 1949, $3.7 billion
in 1954, and $3.8 billion in 1955. Ex-
cept in certain spots, the townspeople
have not been seriously hurt.

Votes are changed not by what the
opposition says, but by what people
feel and think. It will occur to vot-
ers that the parity index has turned
against the farmer not so much be-
cause of the fall in the prices of his
crops, but because of the inflationary
rise in the prices of manufactured
goods due to labor costs.

THERE is no clear evidence of an
Eisenhower slip in towns and small
cities. A straw vote in Shenandoah,
Iowa, showed that while the margin
for Eisenhower over Kefauver was
250 to 156 among farmers, it was
558 to 116 among townspeople.

I believe the vote in the towns and
small and medium-size cities will most
strongly support Eisenhower. The
danger to him is not there or on the
farms, but in the larger cities where
the political arms of the CIO-AFL are
mobilizing millions in cash and thou-
sands of workers to elect Democrats.
The decisive battles will be in Michi-
gan, Pennsylvania, New York, Illinois,
Connecticut, and Massachusetts.
