**PERSPECTIVE**

**Tamper With an Image?**

*by Raymond Moley*

IN RECENT weeks some admirers of
Sen. Barry Goldwater have been
complaining that their favorite has
been too free with offhand opinions
on large issues. Liberal Republicans
hope that these comments of his may
prevent his nomination. And Democrats are using them in behalf of Mr.
Kennedy's re-election. The President,
it is believed, scored perceptibly
when he said in a press conference:
"I think it would be unwise at this
time to answer or reply to Senator
Goldwater. I'm confident he will be
making many charges... in the coming months. And in addition, he himself has had a busy week selling
TVA, and... suggesting that military
commanders overseas be permitted to
use nuclear weapons; attacking the
President of Bolivia while he was
here in the United States; involving
himself in the Greek elections. So, I
thought that it really would be not
fair for me this week to reply to him."
Democratic commentators have followed this line of attack. And while
General Eisenhower said that Goldwater would be a "safe" candidate
and President, he said that the Arizona senator is "impulsive."
The precisionist in me, perhaps because of my years as a schoolteacher
and writer, tends to worry about any
public figure's offhand comments. But
a realism born of long observation of
the habits of the electorate discounts
this worry and these attacks.

**ANOTHER FRONTIER**

Goldwater's popularity is built of
stern stuff and has not been shaken
by his casual remarks. He has always
been free in his comments on the
issues, but along with these his general ideology and his frankness have
won him rapidly mounting support
among millions of Americans. They
are not likely to split hairs about their
favorite. Vast numbers of Americans
agree with his comments. Precision-
ists may quarrel over details, but an
electorate does not. It never has. It
never will.
Not only has Goldwater become a
symbol of protest against a regime
and a trend of policy, but his personality has awakened sentiments
that lie deep in the American spirit.
This has resulted not only in an intellectual but an emotional choice of
Goldwater as a leader. An electorate
wants a sharp and understandable
contrast when it must make a decision between candidates. Fine-spun
arguments between a tweedledum
and a tweedledee evoke only apathy
and indifference. We have seen that
in elections when only half the electorate has chosen to vote.
I hate to use the concept of "images" in describing the Goldwater-
Kennedy contrast, but the President's
preoccupation with image-making has
invited it. No one has expressed this
contrast better than Chalmers H. Roberts, writing in The Washington Post:
"Goldwater, many seem to feel,
represents the wide-open spaces, the
last frontier, the untrammeled American, in contrast to the Kennedy image of Harvard, big-city political
bossism, high living, family high jinks,
and a determination to regiment every aspect of American life."

**PERIL IN CHANGE**

But as Roberts so perceptively
points out further in his article, Gold-
water is no mere embodiment of that
primitive West that so many millions
see in their television programs. The
Arizona which is the Goldwater background is as sophisticated as the
West Coast, Chicago, and New York.
To Goldwater, the jerry-built national welfarism and tax structure of
the 1930s are in need of modernization. He would not and does not
advocate abolishing government help
to those who need it. But he would
bring those programs into line with
modern methods and capabilities.
As a candidate, and as President
if elected, he would be himself. It
would be fatal, now that he is a
serious contender, to change his character. That has happened with other
candidates in the past, with disastrous results.
Those who are concerned about
Goldwater's speeches up to now will
see, as the months pass, the unfolding of a firm and understandable program. He recognizes the need for
expert help.
In this process there will be no
"new" Goldwater, but a real alternative to what the Kennedy Administration is giving us now.
