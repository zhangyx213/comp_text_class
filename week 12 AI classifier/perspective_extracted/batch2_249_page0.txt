**Perspective**
**Construction Taxation**
by Raymond Moley

THERE is one firm opinion upon
which conservatives, "liberals,"
moderates, and those with no concern
except their own taxes, are agreed. It
is that Federal, state, and local tax
laws are a mess. All units of government,
as the costs of government have
risen, have grabbed every source of
revenue and squeezed it dry.
Collectively, our tax laws violate
every principle of sane taxation which
has been defined since Adam Smith.
They depress production. They are
hard to collect. They encourage evasion
and avoidance. They are in large
part hidden in the cost of what we
buy. And they create a vast army of
lawyers and accountants who, with
simpler tax systems, might be used in
more productive employment.
Legislators who enact laws and executives
who recommend changes
have shown little imagination. Boards
and commissions that are constantly
telling us about all the things government
should do for us, relegate the
question: "What are you going to use
for money?" to insignificant notice.
Special-interest groups limit their out-
cries to demands that they and they
alone should get relief.
Probing more deeply into the reasons
for this lack of intelligence, we
find a depressing weakness in our educational
system. The colleges offer
little in the way of instruction in the
principles of taxation. Law schools
give only elaborate courses largely
devoted to instruction in how to serve
clients to their greatest advantage.

**EXPENSIVE GOALS**
The foregoing observations were
impressed upon me as I examined the
recently issued report of the President's
Commission on National Goals.
That commission got generous public
notice when it was appointed and
since its report has been made public.
It was supposed to be a group of high
thinkers, of national stature, who
would consider the nation's needs
over the next ten years. It consisted
of three ex-college and university
presidents, an ex-general, an ex-
judge, an editor, two working heads
of higher educational institutions, two
corporation presidents, and the president
of the AFL-CIO. They had
in their service a large staff of professors,
social workers, and others.
There are 372 pages in the report
delineating what we are going to
need in the next ten years, mostly to
be supplied by government at staggering
cost, but less than two pages
concerning the means by which the
money for all these things can be
found. The comments on this subject
merely say that "the tax system should
be revised." But there are no suggestions
of specific reforms. Only
one member, Crawford Greenewalt of
du Pont, pointed out that weakness in
an emphatic minority opinion.
There might have been constructive
suggestions about how the money
for the recommended benefits might
be found without loading still more
increases on the existing muddled
tax rates.
Space allows me only one notable
example of such omissions.

**PENALIZE SLUMS**
It is recommended that $4 billion a
year should be spent on urban renewal
programs. Presumably, this
would be collected by existing Federal,
state, and local taxesâ€”to be increased,
of course.
But a great part of this undeniable
need might be financed by imposing,
through a review of assessment policies,
a heavy tax on those who own
slum land. This would put an end to
the immense speculative profits now
being made by people who create no
improvements but permit slums to remain
until improvements in the vicinity
raise the value of their properties.
The need to tax this unearned increment
has been stressed a good
deal of late. The magazine House and
Home dealt with it at length in its
August issue. In a recent issue of Look
magazine there was an illuminating
article entitled, "Let's Tax Our Slums
to Death," by an informed Chicago
real-estate man.
The Commission on National Goals
completely overlooked this source of
revenue to meet the cost of urban renewal
and thus lighten the Federal
burden on all taxpayers.
We have reached the limit of what
can be raised from our unreformed
tax system. And we cannot meet the
need by mere wishful thinking about
"economic growth."
