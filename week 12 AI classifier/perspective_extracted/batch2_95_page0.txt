PERSPECTIVE

Frosty Touch of Age

by Raymond Moley

AMONG the millions who saw and
heard President Johnson's first ad-
dress to Congress, many noted the
aged men sitting behind him.
Speaker McCormack and Carl Hay-
den, president pro tem of the Sen-
ate, are respectively in the 73rd and
87th years of their lives. They stand
in the direct succession to the Presi-
dency. Their age is one reason for
the many comments which have ap-
peared suggesting changes in the
order of succession. Such talk, how-
ever, has followed the death of all
Presidents in office, and only in 1947
was anything done about it. Nothing
is likely to be done this time.

The age of these two men, who
have served their constituents for
decades, suggests in a rather vivid
way that the official Democratic Party
generally is well along in years. It
is hardly the bright harbinger of a
new day of which liberals speak so
movingly. Those who control party
affairs, shape policies, pass our laws,
spend our money, and determine our
destiny belong for the most part to
an earlier generation.

The chairmen of the seven com-
mittees of the Senate who will have
most to do with the great issues be-
fore Congress in 1964 have reached
an average age just short of 69. In
the House the most important com-
mittee chairmen average 72.

YOUNG HEAD, OLD BODY

The ripe age of the Democratic
Party was mostly forgotten while
John F. Kennedy occupied the
White House. No doubt, one of the
reasons why he was nominated and
elected was the bright image of
youth which he projected. A new
generation would take over, with
new ideas and illimitable vigor.

Political appeals always seek con-
trast. In 1960 we were invited to
compare John F. Kennedy with
the incumbent, an aging soldier-
statesman. Orators in that campaign
dwelt plentifully upon the Eisen-
hower vacations and golf playing.
The two serious illnesses of President
Eisenhower sharpened the contrast.
The slogan was "Let's get moving,"
fice, the public was bewildered and
Congress confused by an immense
number of innovations called collec-
tively the New Frontier. These, how-
ever, were incandescent fireworks
against a dark party sky.

Now the young President is gone
and the reality stands out. Nothing
much happened about the New
Frontier program. And the new Presi-
dent faces the problem of reactivat-
ing frustrated plans. Can those
beacons be relighted?

OLD IDEAS, NEW NAMES

But were the ideas of the New
Frontier really new? When analyzed,
they appear to be policies of the
1930s dressed up with novel names
and made-over arguments. Created
in a depression decade, they have
little relevance in the 1960s. Spend-
ing, whatever you call it, is
still spending. Deficits, even when
planned, are still inflationary deficits.
That which was called relief in the
1930s is now called welfare, but even
when the sums devoted to it are
multiplied, it is still relief in any gen-
eration. Economic laws stand firm.
That is why the philosophy of the
1930s, which is now called liberal-
ism, has not caught the imagination
of young people who were born too
late to know the New Deal except as
a chapter in their history books. In
the 1930s young voters knew from
personal experience the hard times
of their childhood and youth.

John F. Kennedy attained political
understanding in those depression
years. As President he sought to re-
enact the drama of the early Roose-
velt years when Congress granted
FDR whatever he asked. But Roose-
velt's party in Congress was mostly
new in office after years of Republi-
can majorities. Most of those who
now control Congress were there in
the 1930s. They are not moved now
as they were then.

Lyndon B. Johnson came to Wash-
ington in 1932 before Roosevelt took
office. Perhaps he recognizes that the
policies he has now inherited are the
old ones he knew then. But he has
pledged himself to support them in
a quite different national environ-
ment. How he faces this anomaly will
be his real test in the months ahead.
