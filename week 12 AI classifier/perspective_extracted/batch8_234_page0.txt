**Two Worlds of Tomorrow**

New York's World's Fair opens at a moment when people are facing a crisis of tragic implications. Both the Fair and the crisis relate to a world in which our children will live. The one contemplates its tomorrow with vision and hope; the other sees beauty prostrate and progress buried in hopelessness.

Through the Fair, men and women of imagination and intelligence are trying to tell us something. Inventors, scientists, artists, musicians, industrialists, workers, educators are saying to us that they can create out of the resources around us a world in which enlightenment, comfort, health and the capacity for happiness can grow. They can build such a world—if we give them a chance.

The other world, which people everywhere see before them as in a nightmare, is a place of ruin and of blighted hope. The war that may start will, if our experts are right, engage the energies and resources of the earth. New capacities for destruction may impair beyond recognition the things that European civilization has built over centuries: London, Paris, Berlin, Rome in ruins; millions dead and maimed—not only soldiers, but women and children; hunger, disorder, revolution as an aftermath, no matter who wins; nothing held dear that has been tried, that bears the imprint of tradition, that roots in experience. The people who survive cannot respect the restraints and the rulers of a world that ultimately gave them neither stability nor security. The fantastic, the incredible, the illogical in social and economic and political life will be tried simply because, in a world that failed, it was not tried. Old cycles of disorder will emerge—mob rule, followed by Communism, by dictatorship. Democracy, the product of evolution, of the quiet, intelligent accommodation of conflicting forces, will wait a long time, perhaps generations, for its next chance. Everything else will be tried and will fail first. That is the world that war will give our children.

The rulers who are in power because they have won the confidence of their people are trying to stop the drift toward war. But these rulers are subject to political pressures at home and abroad. Their capacity for intelligent action is limited by inexorable circumstance. They must make moves in a game of make-believe. They must bluff, gamble, save faces. Even the best of news gatherers cannot penetrate, through the seeming, to the essential being. Will Germany fight? Will Italy fight? Does England intend to yield more? What will America do? All these unanswerable questions flame above the open powder kegs.

Rulers, thus circumscribed, may fail. If they do, they will be blamed. Among the makers of the world, the engineers, the artists, the scientists and the politicians, they, the politicians, will be pilloried as those who destroyed all that the others built up. But in that day of accusation, it will be hard for the radicals to blame "the bourgeois, the capitalists and their puppets" as they did twenty years ago. For the radicals had their chance, too. They created the Soviet Republic, which, as cold-blooded and selfish as the next, is simply postponing its aggression until the road to ideological, economic and political empire is wide open, cluttered only with wreckage. We are left with the deep hope that the rulers may still save the world for the builders. The promise in the World's Fair may live. As they have before, the rulers may yet win peace for their people. But their people must let them pay something for peace—something in concessions, forbearance, the willingness to correct wrongs. We must not demand too much of our rulers. They are fragile human beings. They too can succeed—if we give them a chance.


**Intelligent Planning**

It was unfortunate that the Administrative Reorganization plan submitted by President Roosevelt in 1937 should have produced such bitter and wasteful controversy. It had many admirable features. But these were largely ignored in the battle over those parts of the plan that threatened an unhealthy concentration of power in the Executive. Happily that fight is over and all but forgotten now.

Under the law enacted in this session, the President has been given authority to group and transfer agencies, submitting his plans, in all cases, to Congress for review. Roosevelt's Plan No. 1 is an immense step in the process of unifying the scattered agencies created in the haste of the New Deal's early days. The main purpose of such reorganization is to tie agencies into convenient bundles and relieve the President of the burden of dealing directly with scores upon scores of officials.

**NEWSWEEK, MAY 8, 1939**

The President's Plan No. 1 sets up three new agencies—one dealing with Federal security, another with Federal loans and a third with Federal works. These new agencies will be, in a sense, second-string departments, directed by "administrators," rather than secretaries, who receive $12,000 a year. It is probable, since the President designates his own Cabinet and advisors, that he may include these administrators in his Cabinet meetings.

An equally important feature of Plan No. 1 is the transfer of the Budget Bureau, with a number of new planning and statistical functions, to the White House. This is both an important and desirable reform. The Director of the Budget must, of necessity, be a direct subordinate of the President. It is his job to provide the President with continuous information about the operation of the great departments. If he is to be an effective budget officer, he must not only have the strong backing of the President but must be inexorable in his surveillance of Federal administration.

It was never wise to lodge him in any one of the departments, inasmuch as his job is to watch them all. But he was put in the Treasury Department when the office was created nearly twenty years ago, and there he has stuck ever since, although the first holder of the office, General Dawes, made it perfectly clear that he did not consider himself a subordinate of the Secretary of the Treasury. In his book on the budget, General Dawes speaks of an occasion when Secretary Mellon came to his office instead of asking Dawes to come to the office of the Secretary. "That was," says Dawes significantly, "a historic walk in the history of the United States."

But as time went on and less positive Directors of the Budget appeared, the office became a back seat. Its importance was briefly revived by Lewis Douglas, who maintained direct contact with the President and almost ranked as Cabinet officer. With Douglas' departure, and under the Morgenthau administration of the Treasury, the Director of the Budget once again became subordinate to the Secretary of the Treasury.

Now, at last, the office has been freed of Treasury domination and placed securely under the control of the President.  The six administrative assistants for the President, authorized under the Reorganization Act, have not yet been appointed. But the President makes provocative comment about these jobs in his message. Their purpose, he says will be to help the President "get information and condense and summarize it." His playing down of the importance of these officials is presumably advance justification of the decision not to appoint two of his closest young advisers to those posts and to let them operate, as heretofore, from bases outside the White House. But it would be ungenerous to cavil over this one slight incongruity in a generally constructive move.
