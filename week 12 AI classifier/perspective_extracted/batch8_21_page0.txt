**The Black Market Is Enemy No. 1**

**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

The most recent OPA policy shifts mean only one thing: the regionalization of price ceilings. The ideal of a nation marching to the tune of control by a single national schedule of prices is vanishing in the face of hard reality. Enforcement must become local too. The black market has won the first battle.

The term "black market" describes a practice as old as sin and selfishness. It grows as laws against it multiply. Now, in the United States, it is everywhere. It starts with the producer and runs through to the retailer. It is Protean in character, capricious in its effects and, like the Hydra, it grows a flock of new heads every time one is lopped off.

Many of us are innocently patronizing the black market, and the black market shades off into a "gray market." Every housekeeper has personal stories, tales of favors from merchants of steak sold under names like "hamburger" and "baloney," of little unexplained cakes of butter found in market baskets when they are opened in the kitchen. People find it hard to resent these favors. Perhaps they think they have paid for the butter somewhere along the line. They don't count carefully any more.

In some cities there has already been exposed the custom of vegetable markets of wholesalers requiring retailers to take unwanted goods to get the scarcer goods they want.

The black market is big business, too. The current Cleveland Federal Reserve Bulletin reports: "Black-market operations in the livestock industry near and in Cleveland have drawn nationwide attention. This area and the Detroit area have been termed the two 'hot spots' of the nation. In comparison with other livestock terminals in the Fourth District, the receipts destined for local delivery at the Cleveland stockyards have taken a drastic plunge. Competent observers believe this situation to be largely the result of black-market activities which shunt the livestock around the normal and legitimate distributive channels."

What is to be done? For obviously something must be done. Government—Federal, state or local—must control the black market or it will control government. It must be suppressed or inflation will rage uncontrollably.

In attacking it, the government faces a myriad of problems. It can say, as the sailors of Columbus said: "How can we sail where the compass no longer responds to accustomed impulses?" Its carefully calculated cost of living statistics cannot operate in black markets. The OPA is not sure of its measuring rods.

The OPA can also complain, with some justice, that it has inadequate appropriations, cut when Congress was trying to "get" Henderson. Under Henderson, when the OPA announced that women would not be used as "snoopers," it spoke the language of free men. But a desperate government may ultimately resort to such practices.

Meantime, the breakdown of Federal authority throws the incredibly complex problem of enforcement on the local communities, just as it did in Prohibition days. So, again we awaken to the fact that our administration of criminal justice is a national weakness. It has been, it is and will be.

By comparison with the liquor racket, the black market is a giant. It involves hundreds of trades. Unlike most crimes, dealing in it consumes its own evidence. The corpus delicti is eaten. Policing it is not like collecting taxes because, while taxes are hard to collect, there is only one source against which social coercion has to be brought. The tax dodger has no confederate: the bootlegger has at least one.

Perhaps there is still time to take up the suggestion made earlier by Herbert Hoover and others—to limit ceilings to the essentials of life. Ceilings on a dozen or two products would cover 90 per cent of the essential means of life. Let the rest go sky high. It will starve no one if ketchup goes to ten dollars a bottle. But bread and butter are something else. Take the profit out of luxury selling by taxes. This would absorb purchasing power and bear down on inflation.

But whatever the government does, people of good will cannot afford to let the black market go on. They cannot sit back and depend upon Washington. They cannot wait for Washington to mobilize them. The press, the pulpit, the schools—every agency in life must fight this thing. In every community public sentiment must combat the black market. If fundamental habits of liberty prevent government from meeting this threat, then those liberties will have proved insuperable obstacles to their own preservation. For inflation destroys liberty.
