Socialism Smothered in Oil-I

by Raymond Moley

CALGARY, ALBERTA—The dominant
political parties in the adjoining
provinces of Alberta and Saskatche-
wan were both born in the agonies of
an agricultural depression. They are
class parties. Both have been in power
a long time—the Cooperative Com-
monwealth Federation in Saskatche-
wan since 1944, Social Credit in
Alberta since 1935. In both, the hard
cement of voter unity was
hatred of eastern financial
and industrial interests. In
both crusades the leading
figure was and is a minister
of the Gospel. Both philosophies
would, if carried
out, destroy capitalism—the
CCF by taking over private
enterprise (except
the farmer’s private enterprise);
Social Credit by
destroying the value of money. Neither
has succeeded in its mission, and
neither at the moment has any intention
of carrying out its basic philosophy.
Both are literally begging for
new capitalistic enterprises to come in
and make everybody rich. The seduction
of wealth has dissolved the marriage
of ideology.

These two gospels of salvation regard
each other with as deep a
hatred as did the various versions of
Christianity during the religious wars
centuries ago. Each believes itself and
only itself to be on the road to Utopia.
Ideology in both parties has now
been subordinated to a struggle to
stay in power. That is why in both
governments there is, after these
years, evidence of that evolution always
characteristic of ruling groups—
through an initial stage of idealism, to
arrogance, and finally to corruption.
The CCF has reached the second
stage; Social Credit, I strongly suspect,
the third.

Any student of American politics
can recognize the origins of these philosophies
in our own history. We had
them under different names. In
Roosevelt’s first term two groups struggled
to reach the Presidential ear, and
ultimately both found it wide enough
to enter. There were the planners, à
la Marx, who won the TVA, and there
were the easy-money boys who won

devaluation and deficit spending. And
how they hated each other.
The Rev. Thomas Clement Douglas
told me the story of the building of his
CCF philosophy. It seems to have
started when as a boy he heard radical
doctrine in his native Scotland. It
took form while he was at the University
of Chicago. Finally, it learned politics
from Gov. Floyd Olson’s Farmer
Labor Party in Minnesota.
Douglas is a seductive
orator, a veritable Billy
Graham of politics.

The CCF formulated its
dogma in the Regina Manifesto in 1933
which said that “No CCF government
will rest content until it has
eradicated capitalism.” The
prairie caught fire with
Douglas’s oratory, and in
1944 CCF was swept into power.
Douglas told me that he anticipated
that not more than 5 per cent of the
economic life of the province would
be government owned. A very large
part of that 5 per cent, the telephone
and power business, was government
owned long before the CCF was
formed. The extent to which capitalism
has been eradicated is measured
by compulsory automobile insurance,
a shoe factory, a tannery, a brick
plant, a woolen mill, a system of air
transportation, and some bus lines.
Some of these have been economic
flops. The CCF has left it to private industry
to exploit the oil and gas fields,
taking royalties and leasing fees. It
buys the gas and distributes it.

THE speeches of Douglas sound like
those of a chamber-of-commerce
secretary pleading for new businesses.
They stress the vast natural
wealth of Saskatchewan in oil, minerals,
including uranium, and, above all,
the friendliness of the government to
new industry.
Truly this is a miraculous transformation.
It would appear that after a
big draft of the wine of political power
and a view of the mounting wealth of
the province, the Reverend Douglas
has seen a vision of the reconciliation
of God and Mammon, with Marx
skulking into the nether darkness.

Next week Mr. Moley writes about socialism in Alberta.
