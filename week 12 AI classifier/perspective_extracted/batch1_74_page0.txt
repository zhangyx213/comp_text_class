**PERSPECTIVE**

**A BRIEF, NOT A HISTORY**

**BY RAYMOND MOLEY**

Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. ignited a lively controversy last summer when excerpts from his book about the Kennedy years appeared in magazine articles. The discussion was renewed more recently when the book itself, "A Thousand Days," appeared. Now many are buying it to see by reading its 1,031 pages what all the fuss is about. And the blessed fruits of any controversial book are being gathered by the publisher in profits and by the author in royalties. When one decides to write a book of that kind, one must decide whether one wants the book or the author to be assailed. Tell little, and the book will be judged dull. Tell all, and the author will be denounced. Schlesinger seems to have drawn fire on both author and book. But not because the book is dull.

I am not reviewing or evaluating the account here, nor am I attacking the author. I am concerned whether a book like this is a history or a brief in the form of a memoir.

The issue raised is not new. It has appeared many times in the past when individuals who have participated in memorable events under notable men have written books.

**MEMOIRS INEVITABLE**

Twenty-three years after Lincoln's death, in 1888, William H. Herndon, the President's former law partner and close friend, in collaboration with Jesse W. Weik, published his "Life of Lincoln." The book was republished in 1930 by Albert and Charles Boni. The editor said that "Herndon saw Lincoln through the glass of his own personality." That is inevitable in any such work. It reveals the author as well as the principal. Among the books published by members of the Wilson Administration was one by Joseph Tumulty, the President's loyal and capable secretary. Someone said it should have been called "Woodrow Wilson as He Knew Me."

It makes little sense to argue that no one should write a book about events in which he was a close friend and subordinate of a President. There is no law against it, and there should be no such law or order or promise. A man who has participated in making policies has his own record to explain or, if necessary, defend. There may be some differences in interpretation by different contemporaries, because there are different predilections and points of contact.

The best explanation of Schlesinger's purpose in writing his book was in his telling the inquisitors on a "Meet the Press" program that his book is a memoir, useful perhaps 25 years later when serious and objective histories are written. It was unfortunate that so much time was taken in that interview by discussing what Schlesinger said the late President had said about Secretary Rusk. Perhaps, as he himself commented, that was a mistake. But he deserves high marks for what he said about the State Department bureaucracy. Rusk didn't invent that bureaucracy, and he couldn't do much about reforming it even if he tried. Better men have tried in vain over the years.

**WRITER-IN-RESIDENCE**

The deeper question was raised, perhaps inadvertently, when Schlesinger identified himself as a professional historian rather than as a memoirist. Presumably a professional historian is one who writes or teaches history as a means of livelihood. But Schlesinger had discarded the historian's hat when he entered into politics long before he served Mr. Kennedy. He then donned the advocate's hat. One should not change hats in the middle of an interview.

Schlesinger was no doubt invited into the Kennedy inner circle because the new President wanted a "writer-in-residence" or, shall we say, "in-waiting." For Mr. Kennedy realized, as did Henry VII, that it was very useful to have chroniclers in court. Not only must one be a good ruler, but the nation must know how good. The President's choice was neither unworthy nor lacking in shrewdness, for Schlesinger is a prodigious and lively writer with a keen capacity for finding what he is looking for.

Nor am I implying that a politically biased account is an inferior work of authorship. For good defenses in writing are a necessary part of political life.

This is what the reader should realize when he reads this book. It is not history. It is a brief, and a persuasive one.
