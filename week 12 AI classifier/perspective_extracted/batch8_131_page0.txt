**Checks on Inflation**

Seven weeks have passed since the Federal Reserve Board, through its chairman, Marriner Eccles, made a number of considered proposals designed to retard inflation—that somber companion of war and preparations for war. Nothing has been done to further this program. Legislation to activate it has not been drafted. This is partly because of the illness of Senator Wagner, partly because of Washington's overshadowing interest in the Lend-Lease Bill. But chiefly it is because the Administration shows no disposition to support this particular anti-inflation program at the moment, although it is actively interested in other types of inflation control.

Officials who are pooh-poohing warnings about inflation, these days, place great reliance on the obvious fact that it is all but impossible for the United States to have the kind of inflation that most people think of when the word "inflation" is mentioned—the kind of dizzying and devastating decline in the value of money that marked our Revolutionary War and postwar Germany, France and Italy. The present situation differs fundamentally from such situations, they say. We have vast supplies of gold and silver, incomparable means of production to prevent shortages of goods and the skyrocketing of their prices, a great reservoir of unemployed labor and a whole battery of government switches to throw in against inflation. All of which is true.

Nevertheless, the basic cause of inflation remains pretty much the same. Leonard P. Ayres defined it in 1936, when he said:

"It seems clearly to be the rule that in any country that operates for long with unbalanced budgets the amounts of money in circulation and of bank deposits will steadily increase. The existence of this enlarged stock of money need not result in serious and progressive price advances if depression prevails, for then it will circulate slowly, and the excess of productive capacity will be so great that competing offers of goods will eagerly meet each demand. However, in the course of time recovery will come, and as expanding industry begins in various lines to approach capacity outputs, the buyers will compete for the goods, and prices will mount. Once vigorous price advances begin to appear, buyers hasten to fill forward requirements in anticipation of still further increases. This in turn produces the expected advances. A self-stimulating spiral of price advances is thus initiated. Because of the abnormally large supplies of money in existence the prices will mount far, and if meanwhile the government continues to increase the money supply through progressive borrowing, uncontrolled inflation will become a reality."

As recently as last November the London Economist, surveying America's economic outlook, warned: "There is a smell of boom in the air... If the public were for some reason to begin spending, there is no possibility of any control being exerted. An inflationary movement, once touched off, as it well may be within a year or eighteen months by the growth of defense expenditures, might well run away with itself."

largely sold to individuals, insurance companies and the like. But it is convinced that they can be encouraged to buy defense bonds by some means other than the stiffening of interest rates.

In fact, the chief issues between the Reserve Board and the Administration critics of its proposals seem to center in this question of meeting the threat of inflation in ways other than financial. The Administration does not oppose all the Eccles proposals. It merely believes it has better ones. It believes, for instance, that it can control prices by waving the red flag of publicity at specific price increases or by calling in "representative dealers" or by occasionally taking over a plant or by priorities. Priorities alone would prevent inflation if they were drastic enough, it feels, because if you prevent buyers from competing you go far toward preventing sellers from raising prices.

Theoretically these are answers. But it's easy to see their practical flaws. First, there is a question whether you can successfully fix the price of a finished article without fixing the price of every item—including labor—that goes into it. There is the same question about priorities. They must be established for every element that goes into the making of items subject to priority. It might not be possible to establish priorities numerous enough to check inflationary price rises. And if it were, the multiplication of government controls could change the face of our economic life as drastically as inflation itself.

The Eccles warning, supported by the presidents of the twelve Federal Reserve Banks and the members of the Advisory Council of the Reserve System, came along a month or so later. It proposed greater efforts toward balancing the budget; no reenactment of the Presidential authority, which lapses next June, to issue $3,000,000,000 in greenbacks, to monetize foreign silver purchases and to devalue the dollar; an increase in reserve requirements of the banks; sterilization of gold imports; and a larger sale of United States securities to individual investors.

Those who are looking for the danger signals of inflation will be well advised to remember that it will not necessarily show itself in stock-exchange values or commodity prices in the near future. Because of the volume of stock trading going on outside the exchanges, among other things, the stock market is no longer the barometer it once was. New factors in the commodity field likewise affect interpretations of commodity price levels. Beyond this, it is important to bear in mind that inflation is in no small part a psychological phenomenon. It never comes until enough people are convinced that it is coming. Certainly that is the answer to the oft-repeated question, "How much debt can this country carry?" We can probably carry, within reason, about as much debt as we think we can carry.

Particularly significant is the Board's desire to induce individual savers rather than banks to buy government securities. When an individual buys a government bond, he draws a check and sends it to the Treasury, thus transferring a given amount of money from a private account to the public account. So, too, with insurance and trust companies. But when banks subscribe to government bonds for their own account they may, at their option, enter the amount on their books as a new deposit credit against which the government may draw. Such deposit credits are actually new money—created out of the government's promise of future payment. This clearly inflationary method of borrowing money has been our chief means of financing the deficit. Everyone recognizes that continued reliance on it to the same extent, now that business activity is increasing, would be dangerous.

But the very fact that so many considerations render the lessons of the past inadequate ought to put us on our guard. An inflation that expressed itself in far less than a runaway demand for labor and materials could seriously impede the defense program. It is essential that the government adopt a comprehensive series of safeguards, devised cooperatively by the Federal Reserve Board, the Treasury, the Federal Loan Administrator and the leaders of Congress, at the earliest possible moment.

The Reserve Board believes that interest rates must be raised to attract individual savings. The Treasury, on the other hand, wants to finance the defense program at as low a cost as possible. It agrees that defense securities should be
