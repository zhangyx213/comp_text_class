**Perspective**

**Preparing for the Unknown**

The apathetic attitude, or "low
morale," with which the American people
approach the hardships now being so freely
forecast at the end of the second year
of the war, are caused by many circumstances. One of them, mentioned on this
page last week, has been the lack of clear
organization for the industrial and economic job in Washington. This lack the
creation of the seven-member Supply Priorities and Allocations Board, the SPAB,
is intended to dispel. But more dangerous
than the overlapping jurisdictions and bureaucratic misunderstandings among defense
agencies that finally made the need
for the reorganization overwhelmingly
clear is the absence of a unified conception
of the military and naval jobs the American
nation is trying to do.

We undertook our campaign for armament suddenly, when we were some
months into 1940. The campaign for armament was an all-inclusive one, like the
early five-year plans of the Russians. Short
of everything, we assumed we could build
and buy whatever we saw or thought of,
without having too much or too little of
anything.

But the time has come when we
discover that we cannot. We are building,
we find, a multipurpose Army and Navy.
We are preparing for everything at once,
every possible contingency. More, we are
making these diverse and indefinite preparations at the same time that our old
and new friends are draining away much
of the matériel that we manage to put
together.

We are, literally, preparing for war in
the Caribbean and in Alaska, in Iceland
and Hawaii and other points west and
east. We are building planes for use in
semitropical and subarctic conditions. We
even have difficulties getting enough antifreeze mixture for a hypothetical northern
campaign. We are building tanks on the
assumption that no foe, meaning Germany, would be able to land heavy tanks
on these shores under several years; and
yet we are out to assist England to repel
much heavier tanks than ours. Afraid that
we may presently be fighting the most intense specialist the world has seen since
Alexander and his phalanxes, we are jacks
of all trades in war.

Some of the apparent indefiniteness of
accomplishment, if not genuine indefiniteness of aim, can be accounted for by the
requirements that our allies, chiefly the


British, are laying upon us. The military
missions we are sending to China, Burma,
the U.S.S.R., England and South America
will all look after the weapons we are shipping there to see that they are assembled
properly and do not fall into the enemies'
hands too soon. These shipments are naturally a drain on our own supply.

But behind the seeming lack of
clarity about our precise national military
purposes is a reason more fundamental.
We have the ingrained habits of a pacifistic nation. We are unwilling to provoke
war; we cherish no racial or imperial purposes; and we possess no concentrated
military aim to serve as a foundation upon
which an armament can most readily be
built. Contrast our position, then, with
that of dictatorships of small natural
wealth but of a mobilized armament and
a unity of aim enforced by discipline. The
growth of militarism in Japan is an adequate illustration of the situation a country
such as ours faces. It is in point despite
the fact that conciliatory talks between
American and Japanese officials have
been resumed with spectacular publicity
—resumed, in all likelihood, because of the
slowdown of Germany's offensive timetable in Europe.

For many years it has been clear enough
that the militarists were getting control
in Japan. During the Hoover Administration, if not earlier, it was the policy of the
American State Department to do nothing
which might build them up in Japanese
affairs. We carefully avoided giving any
offense that might stir a naturally proud
if brittle people to emotions strong enough
to lead them to turn over everything to
the generals. This policy was broadly continued by the Roosevelt Administration
up to the point where our own officials began to conclude that the so-called "normal" ways of national conduct—the ways
that were shaped by industrial and commercial interests—were being discarded in
favor of national prestige, faith in racial
destinies and a violent, militant imperialism.

Involved in the turn from the "normal"
ways are large numbers of Japanese themselves. They made no secret of their antipathy to the military regime. They even
invited in Americans to see for themselves
that the commercial class in Japan was
little different from the same class in
America in its dislike of militarism. They
remained thoroughly aware of their own
insecurity of tenure. They knew that the
old military caste was jealous of the coming of the great industrialism and was only


biding its time. They watched their nation slowly melt into a military socialism.
Had Japan been intrinsically a wealthier
land, she might have been a more dangerous enemy, but she probably would
also have been a more trustworthy friend.
The same phenomenon was occurring, to
a degree, in Italy and Germany, where the
military spirit was only waiting for Mussolini and Hitler, fortuitously assisted to
its goals by self-deceived industrialists.
These nations began not only to prepare
their arms; they began to shape their
military strategy—a strategy that was
consistent with itself and with its industrial background. There was plenty of
warning of what was going on, but little
adequate appreciation either in England
or the United States. It was as if nations
like ours, in which the industrial revolution swept furthest forward, had forgotten
that medieval motives lingered on in the
world and were in resurgence in countries
that had emerged more recently from the
dominance of the warrior class.

So we confront nations that have cherished distinct military purposes for a long
time, long enough to have the jump on us.
They have had those most valuable things
in war, unity of aim and command and consistency in organization. Without those
unities and consistencies their smaller resources must have been exhausted long
ago.

Needless to say, our own resources are
infinitely larger. But even they are not unlimited. And their limits, for all practical
purposes, are tighter than we supposed
they were before we had begun to grapple
with the industrial dislocations that are
now upon us. We could afford a diffusive
program in the early stages of armament;
or before our desperate allies called on us
for help. The time is passing when such a
policy is sound.

Perhaps that means that the Army
and Navy and the Executive must be of
one mind as to the area in which a war
we fight should take place, if, when and as
it comes, the weapons to use in such a
contingency and the time to use them.
But most certainly it requires that the
Army, Navy and Executive be ready to
tell the country in detail that ours, as a
defense force, also has its timetable—a
timetable as definite and positive as any
on which the offensive forces have been
operating.

We have created so many boards in our
scramble for efficiency in production that
it seems pretty silly to suggest another.
But another we need nevertheless, a group
concerned with grand strategy. Working
in harmony with the President and the
Secretary of State, it ought to consider in
broad terms just what we need to defend
ourselves against, how big our Army,
Navy and Air Force should be, and what
amounts of various kinds of equipment
we should ultimately procure.
