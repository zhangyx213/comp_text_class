**Reckoning in California**

by Raymond Moley


LOS ANGELES—The contest between Sen. William Knowland and Attorney General Edmund G. Brown for the governorship grows more and more intense here by the hour. Brown himself is incidental. The labor-union-radical-Democratic forces and interests are powerful and confident. These must be rewarded if Brown wins, and the state’s solvency and stability may be the price. Several other contests are also under way—over certain constitutional amendments, the U.S. senatorship, for attorney general, and the legislature.

When I arrived here in late September there was no question about odds. The campaign was just beginning for Knowland; for the right-to-work proposal (Proposition 18); for a very attractive Republican, Pat Hillings, for attorney general; and for control of the legislature. Money was scarce, the Republican Party was divided, confusion and defeatism were prevalent, and registration was heavily Democratic. The opposition had been at work for months and years.

**1950 PARALLEL**

Since then, a considerable awakening has taken place, mostly because of the grim alternative to a Knowland-Hillings voluntary-unionism victory. As far as Proposition 18 is concerned, it might become a dead letter with a union-dominated governor and legislature. The Democratic platform adopted in August was only reluctantly made available to the public in October. It is a formidable, reckless, radical mass of proposals. One provision would put into the law an idea, fostered by Walter Reuther during the Kohler strike, which would deny purchases by any state agency from a producer “charged with unfair labor practices or against whom a strike is being conducted by a bona fide union.” Another proposal, to abolish the state sales tax and increase the income tax, parallels Proposition 17 which would wreck the state’s finances. There are also the usual bits of bait: More pensions given indiscriminately, very high unemployment insurance, and socialized medicine.

I was struck by the strong parallel between the campaign against Knowland and that spearheaded by mobilized labor-union leaders in Ohio against the re-election of Senator Taft in Ohio in 1950. There William Green thundered: “Cost what it may, let it be what it will, we’re going to bring about the defeat of Senator Taft.” Here the same threats are made on all sides. In late September 1950 I found no observer who would give Taft a chance. But Ohio citizens, business and professional people at all levels, went to work in the precincts, towns, and counties. Three weeks later, Taft was ahead and was later re-elected by a big vote. That could happen here, but only by the same effort by the same sort of people.


**MEN AND THEIR TIMES**

It is wry and tragic to hear the “charges” against Knowland, even among members of his own party. He is too inflexible, serious, inaccessible, they say. Yes, he is a very strong man whose serious mien in national and international affairs is in keeping with serious, Knowland-like times. He yields to no capricious breezes of opinion, abhors expediency, makes no deals. Also, there are thousands who say: “He has spent too much time in Washington, in the Senate. He has spent too little time out here meeting us, listening to us, getting for us the local things we want.” In short, he is being accused of being a statesman. They are saying that sort of thing about Goldwater in Arizona. Little people used to say that about Borah in Idaho and Hiram Johnson here. But overwhelming majorities for those men of the past were measures of the pride people had in having the services of noted men. Those were days when there was chiseled on a state building in Sacramento something about “men to match my mountains.”

Back about 1780, there was complaint among the electors of Bristol, England, about their member in Parliament. He was Edmund Burke, in enduring influence the greatest British statesman of his time and, incidentally, America’s greatest friend. On returning to Bristol, Burke heard of those complaints and rejected his seat in an imperishable letter: “I canvassed you through your affairs and not your persons… I could hardly serve you as I had done and court you, too.”
