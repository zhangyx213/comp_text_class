**The British Election and the U.S.**

**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

At any moment in the past ten years this remarkable British political upset would have had very important influences over here. A British Labor victory during New Deal days, from 1933 to 1939, would certainly have moved us further to the left on the domestic front. And during the six years of war, it would have given us profound concern about the fate of Europe. To have seen Churchill cast out before the German war was won would have been like a crushing defeat for our arms. But at the moment, American affairs are passing through a phase in which our course can hardly be affected by this event in Britain.

On the domestic scene, our problems are not ideological. They are, primarily, practical problems of keeping up the war effort against Japan, and while we need and anticipate British help, we feel that we have things in hand. Our tremendous task of reconversion can hardly permit social and economic experimentation. That will have to wait until we are on an even keel. We are so far committed to the financial support of our Allies that changes in their governments will not alter our foreign economic policies. The charter commits us to political leadership.

The very circumstances which brought about this British result—circumstances rooted in the war weariness, the financial stress, the housing necessities of the British people—can have no bearing on our own policies. Our domestic situation is so different that the remedies the British choose to adopt can hardly be prescribed for us.

It is clear that Americans have, with practical unanimity, reached the conclusion that with all our demonstrated strength we must begin to behave like a world power. The overwhelming support of the Charter, the Bretton Woods setup and vast additional lending plans commit us to a position in world politics analogous to that held by Britain for nearly two centuries. Americans, with not a few regretful glimpses at the detached days of the past century, have accepted a new view of our place in the world. It is not for us, therefore, to wait for what may happen with a new British Government. It is our job to move on with our own responsibilities. That is why any changes in British policy, as a result of this election, can have only an incidental meaning for us.

The American Navy has felt for some time that our share in the Japanese war is very large. That feeling the country as a whole has adopted. It was expressed in the authorized broadcast of Capt. E. M. Zacharias, in which he told the Japs that if they choose to make peace now, “it will be the United States which will enforce the formula and ensure the peace.” The war with Japan will go on, regardless of the policies of the new British Government. But, it should be added that basic British foreign policy is little affected by changes in government, except, perhaps, in this case, in Britain’s colonial affairs. It is too early to speculate with much assurance on what the election may mean in the relative strategy of the Big Three. Unquestionably, Stalin always retained some suspicion of the British Conservatives. The British-Russian relations may be easier now. But on the other hand, Russian realization of less British strength may mean a more aggressive policy in those corners of the world where the two nations have measurably conflicting interests. The United States can, if it will, exercise more of a balance between its two big partners.

There will be few Americans who will not deeply regret this personal defeat of Winston Churchill. No foreign statesman has ever been so loved and admired by Americans. His great place in history is assured. But the British have often turned out great Prime Ministers after they have saved the empire. In the case of the elder William Pitt, they actually turned out, in 1761, the man who did most to create the British Empire. His son, after eighteen years in power, suffered the same fate, in 1801. Both returned to the government later, but for very short periods. The nation, as distinguished from the electorate, enshrined them in perpetual glory. No other Englishman deserves to rank with the two Pitts in patriotism and in devotion to basic liberty.
