**How to Behave Like a World Power**

by RAYMOND MOLEY

**3â€”Training Men of Affairs**

In our new role in the world, nothing is more immediately imperative than the strengthening of our official foreign service. The State Department from time to time announces a shake-up in top officials. But the vast bureaucracy which centers in the State Department and extends all over the world needs the infusion of new blood, from top to bottom.

President Roosevelt was aware of this need, as was President Hoover before him. But nothing really fundamental has happened since, twenty years ago, Secretary Hughes established a half-hearted merit system under the Rogers Act. Mr. Roosevelt was not at his best in detailed administrative reform, and Secretary Hull accepted his appointment on the explicit condition that he was to deal with policy, not personnel. The foreign-service bureaucracy is deeply entrenched. The means of training personnel is inadequate. And political pressure for appointments to high posts is exceedingly heavy.

Meanwhile, the essential training and traditions in the Army and Navy have been proved in this war. It is not without significance that the two dominant American figures in foreign lands are Generals Eisenhower and MacArthur. Both are thoroughly trained career men.

It may be essential that an Annapolis-West Point type of school be created for final intensive training for the diplomatic service. But the problem is much broader than just the need for a single school. It involves the coordinated effort of government and many existing colleges and universities.

The need for trained people in international affairs, moreover, is much broader than the requirements of the official foreign service. Business concerns, trade associations, welfare agencies, journalism and education need experts in foreign affairs. What is emerging is a profession, suitable for a life's work and appropriate for as exact a process of preliminary training as are the professions of medicine, law or engineering.

Training for the professions, except in the armed services, has never been a function of the Federal government. It has grown up in our universities, which are now preeminent in the world. There are at least twenty American universities with the resources necessary to build up schools of foreign service, and in a dozen of these beginnings have already been made.

There are a number of advantages in having several institutions scattered over the country training people for foreign service. The first is that the need for such specialists is too large to be met by one school. Another is that our foreign service should not have the point of view of a single part of the country. It should, in the aggregate, represent all America.

But the greatest advantage is that one university may have special advantages for offering training on Africa; another, on Russia; another, on the Far East; still another, on the Mediterranean world. Columbia is already well advanced toward a professional graduate school in foreign service. Harvard is formulating plans of a similar sort. Stanford has announced plans for undergraduate instruction in the subject.

In the past the British Foreign Service has taken graduates of its universities into government training for about a year's preliminary study. The people so trained are then started in the lower ranges of service.

In Washington, the State Department has a three months' preliminary training course, and certain limited facilities for offering in-service training. The department recognizes the inadequacy of these provisions, and a serious study of the subject is underway. During the war several institutions, notably the Navy and Army schools for training men and women in civil administration and in languages, have done pioneering work which will be experience useful in the future.

Great diplomats like John Hay, John Quincy Adams, Bismarck and Lord Bryce were the products of long and intensive education and training. There is nothing accidental about statesmanship.
