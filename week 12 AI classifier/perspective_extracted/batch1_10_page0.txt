**TITAN UNBOUND, II**

**BY RAYMOND MOLEY**

In a piece two weeks ago I noted that a major, probably the major, long-term policy of the Soviet Union is to stay out of a great war, and, by developing a massive sea potential, to break out of its traditional landlocked isolation. That policy, created even before the death of Stalin fourteen years ago, has been binding upon all Russian leaders since. Some five-year economic plans have fallen short. But naval strength and seagoing commerce have even outpaced their original objectives.

At the end of World War II the Soviet merchant fleet was insignificant. When Stalin died in 1953 his government's 500 ships aggregated 1.5 million gross registered tons. Then maritime policy accelerated, and in five years an 80 per cent increase was made. That brought Russia into twelfth place among maritime nations. A seven-year plan began in 1959, and the fleet expanded to 7,290,000 gross tons, with 1,437 ships.

The economic potential of a merchant marine is measured not only in the number of units and total tonnage but in age. A technological revolution is a swift destroyer. Here the Russians, building from little, have a great competitive advantage. In 1964, 48 per cent of their dry-cargo ships and 63 per cent of their tankers were less than four years old. Only 22 per cent of the total were more than nineteen years old.

**AMERICA, THE OBSOLETE**

goslavia, East and West Germany, Japan, Italy, Poland, Sweden, Holland, Britain, Denmark—a good customer paying billions in cash and meticulously abiding by contracts.

The American active merchant marine is overwhelmingly obsolete—70 per cent of World War II vintage. To meet our needs in Vietnam, decayed relics are hauled out from the rusty reserves. They break down and are towed into port. These ships are the stigmata of our maritime sickness. The building program, which the Maritime Administration describes as proceeding “at a deliberate [snail’s] pace,” is 100 ships behind schedule. A baker’s dozen are delivered annually. Last year 109 of the reserve fleet were turned into scrap. There is a great tanker and bulk carrier fleet built for American owners and sailing under many flags, and some serve in the war in Vietnam. But their contribution to American employment is mainly a bonanza to admiralty lawyers.

**MONUMENTAL CHALLENGE**

The Maritime Administration’s figures on deliveries of new merchant ships are most significant. The U.S.S.R. added 100 new vessels in 1966 and in addition received 55 transfers from thirteen countries. The U.S.A. added thirteen. Robert L. Nichols, in “A Survey of Russian Shipping,” derived from Russian sources, notes that in a single year the Russians added more new ships than the U.S.A. built in five years. Only 386 ships have been built for the U.S. flag since 1947. But even more important so far as the future is concerned is the fact that as of May 1966 the Soviet had 581 ships under construction or on order.

“Jane’s Fighting Ships, 1966-1967” makes particular reference to the Soviet Union’s 2,000 merchant ships aggregating 9.5 million gross tons as an adjunct of naval strength. Her naval forces are now deployed on a worldwide scale. Her merchant fleet is “twice as big numerically and four times the size in capacity as it was only a decade ago, and is now the sixth largest in the world … the time has now come when [Russia] can exploit the oceans to the full.”

The U.S.S.R. seeks not only monetary returns but the multiplication of influence everywhere. Landlocked isolation is gone forever. Seapower is a reality and, to Americans, a monumental challenge.
