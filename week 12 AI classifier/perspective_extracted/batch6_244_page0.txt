**Ike the Cabinet Maker**

by Raymond Moley

WE HAVE learned more in the short span since election about the man we have chosen for President than in all his speechmaking. In the first place, he has shown an unparalleled capacity for quick and wise decisions. My memory recalls no previous occasion when, within a short 30 days after election, a President-to-be has practically completed and announced his major appointments. F.D.R., who claimed distinction as a man of action, was still fooling around with at least four spots after four months. The Ickes and Woodin selections were desperate last-minute grabs. The breathtaking promptness of Ike's decisions has prevented weeks of speculation, intrigue, party dissension, and economic stalemate.

The second encouraging point in this series of selections is what it shows us of the general's essentially conservative habit of mind. Perhaps he would call it "middle-of-the-roadism." It would seem to be more appropriate to call it conservatism. In August, after two conferences with Eisenhower in Denver, it became clear to me that on domestic issues he was somewhat more conservative than Taft. He was a more ardent believer in checking the invasion by the Federal government of the states and in private economic affairs. Taft, it must be remembered, is of the tradition of his father and of T.R.—that is, of the "New Nationalism." It is ironical in the light of pre-convention attacks on the conservatism of Taft that the senator now, while pleased with the choices, is scared because of the weight of big business in the prospective Cabinet.

Governor McKay represents the Eisenhower faith in states' rights. Wilson, Humphrey, Summerfield, and Adams are decidedly friendly to the individual-enterprise system. Another very definite pattern appears in these appointments. There have been wails from disappointed Fair Dealers since the election to the effect that Ike owes nothing to the Republican Party and that his victory is purely personal. Eisenhower clearly does not believe such nonsense. Over and over he has affirmed and reaffirmed his belief in party government. He has now laid the evidence on the line that he really believed what he said. This Cabinet is much more Republican than F.D.R.'s was Democratic. We may expect many concessions and friendly gestures toward conservative Southern Democrats, but that is again recognition of the political reality of the conservative coalition in Congress. The selections so far for the Cabinet and other posts follow the line of rewards for party service.

Moreover, this Cabinet is a nicely balanced selection from all elements of the Republican Party. It certainly sinks without trace Stevenson's joke about the two-headed elephant. The GOP that now appears in the Cabinet is a quite normal, contented, and healthy animal. Taft and Dewey, Lodge and Dirksen —all seem to be pleased. This marks the application on the domestic political scene of the fabulous Eisenhower capacity to compose differences. Finally, there is a fine human touch in the pattern. Herbert Brownell has labored for ten years with little recognition or reward—for Dewey in New York, for Dewey on the national ticket, for the Republican Party, and latterly for Eisenhower. To know Herb Brownell is to realize the true embodiment of quiet, unassuming, loyal devotion to his party and his friends. He could have been passed over and he would not have done a Morse. But Ike has done the generous thing. The recognition of Lodge may be distasteful to some Taft supporters, but they must recognize that political service deserves its reward. Likewise, the recognition of Stassen.

Despite our personal preferences we all must recognize that Ike did win the election and is entitled to choose some of those who supported him.

**ALTOGETHER,** the Cabinet-to-be reflects the President-to-be. He is decisive and conservative, a man who believes in party teamwork, an American who understands the breadth and variety of American life, and a human being who remembers those who help when help is needed. Quite a President. Look well and offer thanks, for he is rare.
