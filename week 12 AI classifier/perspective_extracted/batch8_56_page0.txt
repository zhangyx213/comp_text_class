**"Borrowed Time" in the Colleges**

by RAYMOND MOLEY

September in the colleges—traditionally full of glamour, expectancy and a measure of playfulness—is not what it used to be. It opens on the campus this year not on an atmosphere of droning idleness, but on vibrant life everywhere.

There was a time when, this month, the boys were back home, packing their books and saying their good-byes to the folks. Now they’re at college—and while this is based largely on observations at Yale, Harvard and Columbia, it’s true of almost all the colleges—and they’re studying like mad for the examinations covering the term that began early this summer. Later this month, they will get a few days of leave before October sees them deep in harder courses and more of them. But in short, thousands of boys, who never before cracked a book during the summer, have been sweating away for eleven or twelve weeks. And looking beyond this war, the present acceleration may prove that we should never go back to the old long, leisurely years of residence, with ample vacations and none too exacting work.

At Yale, 97 per cent of the upper-classmen took the summer work. Eighty-five per cent of the freshmen entered in early July. Seventy-five per cent of the seniors (figures for the other classes are not yet available) are in the ROTC or the Army, Navy and Marines “enlisted reserve.” Of the remaining 25 per cent, many are in war-industries work or in the medical school. These figures vividly suggest the immense change that has come over our colleges and the boys at work there.

The Hon. Paul McNutt need make no speeches about responsibilities to these boys. They’ve already been reminded of them time and again. They know that they are in college “on borrowed time.” They know, most of them, that they’ll either do well—or else. They are acutely conscious of the fact that insofar as the country permits them to continue their education, it is because they prove themselves worthy of it and prepare themselves, in some way or other, to serve as specially trained potentials in the service of the nation.

The threat of weeding out is, for these boys, a serious one. And properly so. There is an economic pressure too.

They’ve been told by the folks at home what it means to keep a boy in college in the face of mounting taxes and inflationary prices. The parents of these boys are of the income-tax groups that have, up to now, borne the major shock on the money front. The boys know, thousands of them, that their parents may not be able to weather the college bills for the few years ahead.

The sense of the need for making good and of being on trial, would itself account for the seriousness of the mood on the campus this autumn. But two other factors reinforce it—the nature of the work the boys are doing and their own awareness of what is going on in the world.

There is a tremendous drift toward scientific subjects. The next generation will know its trigonometry as we used to know the multiplication table. Trigonometry, chemistry, physics, in addition to new technical military courses—all these loom large on the campus, for the country desperately needs more experts in these subjects. At the same time that reading and laboratory work have been piled on without stint, physical toughening-up has been a major concern of the colleges.

Most important of all, there is scarcely one of them who does not know that while every war is a young man’s war, this is critically and decisively a war to be won by youth. Movies that show the heroism of the RAF have a singular fascination for them. They go to the same one again and again, and come out with tight lips and misty eyes. Doubts about foreign policy, so freely expressed on the campus a year or two ago, are heard no more.

So far as I can see, the boys know that there is a long, rough road ahead; that what happens now is in a large part up to them; that doubt is a dissipation of energy; and that they must serve the nation where they can best serve it—whether that be in school, or at work in a war industry or with the Army, Navy or Marines. And when the time comes for them to take their places, they will be ready—more resolute, more intelligent, better prepared and more skillful than any generation that ever went to war.
