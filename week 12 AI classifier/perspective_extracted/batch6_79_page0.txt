Black Coal for White-I
by Raymond Moley

Along with the horror stories about
the misdeeds of the "power oc-
topus"—a hardy perennial since the
1890s—the most familiar argument of
the Morses and Trumans is that of a
"power shortage" in the Pacific North-
west. This specter of a blackout must,
according to the refrain, be prevented
by pouring Federal money into the
Columbia and its tributaries. It must
be Federal money, they
say, for all other specie is
tainted and undemocratic.

Meanwhile, far to the
east by south, hundreds and
hundreds of miles away, an-
other real shortage has
been exploited by vote-
hungry politicians. It is a
shortage of work for coal
miners who live among hills
enriched by immense coal
deposits. An analysis of the 1954 elec-
tion which I presented in this space
indicated that the unhappiness caused
by that work shortage switched
enough votes to elect a Democratic
House of Representatives.

A basic economic factor is present
in both regions: Power for the proc-
esses of industry. In the Northwest
there is falling water—white coal they
call it out there. In the basin of the
Ohio River, there is black coal. There
is also the great new aluminum indus-
try, which demands immense quanti-
ties of electric power. To grow, it
must move where electric power is
plentiful and production and trans-
portation are cheapest.

Both regions can prosper only if
they have a balanced economy which
is achieved when there are plenty of
people, with remunerative work to do
and with the demands and purchasing
power essential to the growth of di-
versified commerce and industry.

Certainly there is no immediate
shortage of power in the Northwest.
Politicians who use that argument for
the spending of vast new Federal out-
lays on hydroelectric power are
wrong. After diligent research, an
able reporter for The Spokane Chron-
icle, W. Newland Riley, reports no
present shortage, but adds that the
Bonneville Power Administration says
that there will be need for much more
power in the next two decades. This
opinion of a Federal Agency is sus-
tained by private utility heads. Kinsey

M. Robinson of the Pacific Northwest
Power Co. says that the Northwest is
facing a power shortage after 1960,
but "if the Federal politicians stand
aside we'll do the job faster and bet-
ter and it won't cost the taxpayers
a cent."

The movement of the aluminum in-
dustry to the Northwest has been a
blessing, but it has also created a long-
term problem. Large pro-
ducers have settled there
because power has been
cheap. A study made within
five years shows that while
aluminum uses more than
half of all the power going
into industry, it employs a
relatively small proportion
of the employed labor force.

The aluminum producers
have no intention to move
the plants already located in the Pa-
cific Northwest. But for many reasons
new installations of the industry are
likely to be made elsewhere.

In the first place, Congress has
been showing less and less disposition
to appropriate such large sums for
Federal hydroelectric plants in so
few states. Moreover, the cost per
kilowatt of hydro power has risen be-
cause of inflationary trends in the
past twenty years. In this respect we
see a wonderful example of the ulti-
mate frustration of government plan-
ning. The New Deal sought on the
one hand to grab a monopoly of elec-
tric power by building great hydro-
plants. But also it deliberately stimu-
lated inflationary prices and wages.
The one has now overtaken the other.


The people of the Northwest—and
people anywhere—have come to realize
that public power is a spurious issue.
They know that they can be served
better and quicker and at less bur-
den in their tax bills by the
development of privately owned utili-
ties which get their money from pri-
vate investors.

All this leads to the most significant
bit of industrial evolution which this
country has seen in a long time—the
revival of the coal industry and its
more efficient use of producing elec-
trio power. The economic and political
implications of this development I
shall describe next week.
