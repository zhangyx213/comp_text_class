**Perspective**

**The Irreconcilables**

**by Raymond Moley**

THERE are unmistakable signs of a more moderate trend among American voters. One might say, with due care in interpreting the word, that it is a conservative trend. Four weeks ago, I witnessed it during a visit to Houston, Texas. A week later I saw such evidence in the California primary. Last week I found such manifestations in Ohio.

The apathy of conservative Democrats in Texas has permitted a radical group called "Democrats of Texas" (DOT) to elect such candidates as Senator Yarborough. Two years ago, in Harris County (Houston) there were elected seven DOT candidates for the legislature. DOT also controlled the county Democratic committee. This year, after intensive effort by business and professional people, the tide was sensationally turned. In primaries in May and June, five conservative legislators were elected; two were radical; and one, moderate. The conservatives captured the county committee.

In California there was a protest vote of several hundred thousands against the "liberal" Brown. Most of this would have gone to Nixon had it been possible for conservative Democrats to vote for him. The large Nixon vote in Pennsylvania, Indiana, Illinois, and Nebraska also indicated a conservative swing.

**AMERICAN TORIES**

Also important is the warm reception given to Sen. Barry Goldwater in his appearances over the country. He has become a most articulate spokesman for conservatives. His book, "The Conscience of a Conservative," has a deserved popularity. But Goldwater is now irreconcilable. He realizes that to throw into sharp reverse the trend of the past 25 years would be inexpedient and self-defeating. What is needed is to slow up the drift to the left before it is too late.

This view is not shared by altogether too many irreconcilable conservatives. Their position is that if a candidate is not with them all the way, they will not help. In short, they will join the Rockefellers, trying to prevent a Republican victory. I have met many of these in my travels. A lawyer told me in Texas that unless "Nixon gets rid of Rogers" he will quit. Another voiced similar sentiments about the Secretary of Labor. Another is against Nixon because he will not have a public brawl with Secretary Flemming. Another man was mad because Goldwater was not selected as Republican keynoter, not realizing that the senator's pledges from two states for the nomination automatically bar him.

It is a good thing to have ultraconservative people and organizations making their views known. But when their distaste for some of Nixon's views or friends amounts to a threat to defeat him, they relinquish their role as opinion makers and become very poor statesmen. Not all the Tories in Britain like Macmillan. But they realize that he is their only hope against socialist government.

**THE MIDDLE WAY**

The statesman must reckon with what he has to deal with and the conditions under which he must operate. The principle that the Federal government within its means must contribute to the general welfare is an established national policy. That is also true of a moderate amount of regulation of economic affairs. For unlimited competition would ruin the capitalist system.

To say that is not to "me-too" the "liberals" or appease the Rockefellers. The New York governor's attack upon the President's defense policies, his espousal of a great percentage increase in the gross national product by government action, his commitment to excessive welfarism and bigger bureaucracy, with little regard to inflationary forces, is exactly what Stevenson, Kennedy, and Symington have been saying. Only in advocating forcible arbitration in certain labor disputes does Rockefeller differ from them. That would mean a dangerous impairment of free collective bargaining and end in price and wage fixing in key industries. Probably the New York governor and his "team" anticipate defeat for his party in 1960 and look toward 1964.

Good sense, moderation, and the preservation of free institutions lie somewhere between our Tories and our self-styled "liberals."
