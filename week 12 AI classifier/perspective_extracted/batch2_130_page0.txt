**PERSPECTIVE**

**Report on Wastelandâ€”II**

by Raymond Moley

MY PURPOSE in this review of Comptroller General Joseph Campbell's reports on government efficiency and economy is to show that without eliminating a single Federal agency or program many hundreds of millions, perhaps billions, could be saved. This is not to imply that dozens of unnecessary, not to say absurd, operations could not be eliminated. But there is cause and effect when we consider why any agency is created and how it operates. The vast proliferation of programs creates the main reason why they cannot be administered in practice.

I have examined some hundreds of the Comptroller General's reports submitted to Congress over the past year, as well as his summary in his annual report. They fall into a pattern showing waste, incompetence, and stupid management.

The most common classes of waste show at least five categories: inefficient and unnecessary purchasing; incompetent care of government property; bad personnel management; unnecessary losses in government-operated businesses, and faulty accounting practices.

**BUYING AND HOARDING**

The greatest of all in terms of wasted dollars is in government purchasing. Some examples are: buying material far beyond need, thus making necessary heavy storage costs and deterioration of material; buying by one service when another service has an oversupply of an equivalent article; buying very expensive equipment when the manufacturer is also selling the same things in a bargain sale; one service buying directly from a manufacturer instead of through a central procurement agency; inadequate cost evaluations; buying and oversupply for storage when manufacturers are capable of providing the stuff when needed; buying new articles when simple repairing of what is on hand would suffice; buying from a higher bidder because of inconsequential details in specifications, and inadequate specifications by the purchasing agency.

All government agencies seem to have the passion for accumulation made famous by the Collyer brothers in New York some years ago. There is lack of care in storage and lack of review in purchases which continue year after year despite changes in costs and prices. There are huge rentals for oversupplies, renting of storage facilities when it would be cheaper to build, and building when it would be cheaper to rent.

**THE LITTLE STREAMS**

Bureaucrats seem to have a mania for travel. In the Comptroller General's reports there are many examples of government personnel traveling expensively when slower and cheaper transportation would suffice. Sometimes there are heavy expenses for hauling household equipment when the individual concerned is to be at a new location for only a brief time. In some cases the legal limit in the weight and amount of such transportation is exceeded. An excessive amount of living quarters are built, resulting in unused and vacant space. There is obsolete retirement pay and benefits.

Among the many businesses which government operates is the production, transmission, and sale of electric power. Some of these operations run recurring deficits. The Bonneville Power Administration is outstanding. In order to sustain the political claim of "cheap" power, inadequate rates are charged and deficits result.

It is reported in many cases that accounting practices fall far short of the standards common in private business. Thus, neither Congress nor the Executive can gain the information essential to a yearly evaluation of what goes on in such agencies. Since these innumerable deficiencies seem small when the immense budget of the government is considered, they are dismissed as mere trifles. "What," we are asked, "are a few hundred thousand dollars or even a few millions here or there, when it is billions that should be saved?" That is like dismissing the rapid increase in civil expenditures because the military budget is so much larger. But in the aggregate presented by the Comptroller General's reports, the wasted dollars amount to vast sums. They are the little streams that make a mighty river.
