**The New Under Secretary of State**

**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

ROBERT A. LOVETT, chosen by the
President and Secretary Marshall
as Under Secretary of State, has an un-
usual distinction. Of all the men in
Washington and abroad who contrib-
uted great leadership to the war ef-
fort, Lovett was least publicized. A ter-
rific literature grew in the press and
in books about soldiers, sailors and of-
ficials, high and low. But Lovett's
name was rarely mentioned.

Such distinction on the
part of an important offi-
cial in Washington must be
earned the hard way. It must
be planned, and it must be
inexorably pursued. A way-
ward word destroys it. For
the capital is a hive of ears
-a nest of tongues. Lovett,
having been summoned in
1940 to build the world's
greatest air force where prac-
tically nothing existed before, planned
to let others do the talking, writing and
dining. The glamorous Hap Arnold, a
great soldier in his own right, sold the
Air Forces to the nation and swept it
over the world. The Assistant Secretary
of War for Air sat in the shadow, build-
ing-building indefatigably-until the
production of heavy bombers rose from
a mere half dozen to 500 a month.
This was one of the stupendous achieve-
ments of our history. When victory
had been won, Lovett quietly slipped
away from Washington and went back
to private life.

THERE can be no anonymity in the
job to which he has now been sum-
moned. The Under Secretary is the op-
erating head of our foreign office-its
spokesman, its advocate and its ex-
plainer. He cannot, must not make mis-
takes. He cannot avoid the bright light
of publicity. Over the years the Secre-
tary of State has become a sort of chair-
man of the board in foreign affairs.
When Cordell Hull became Secretary
in 1933, it was specified that he was to
deal with policy exclusively. He wanted
no administrative tangles on his desk.
This situation is underlined now be-
cause the Secretary lives in a handbag,
from Moscow to Mexico. The Under
Secretary is Acting Secretary most of
the time. And the responsibility is great-
er, for President Truman is not trying,
like Roosevelt, to be his own Secretary
of State.

Unlike his predecessor, Lovett is not
a lawyer, although he studied law for
a while and then turned to business
administration. For fourteen years he
was a partner in a banking firm. The
nature of his firm's multitudinous con-
nections made it a center of knowledge,
accurate contemporary knowledge, of
economic and political affairs at home
and abroad. Those who knew Lovett
before the war regarded him as one of
the very few thoroughly informed stu-
dents of European economic affairs.
Lovett's father was Robert Scott Lov-
ett, who for years directed
the Harriman railroad em-
pire. The son has inherited
his father's fine capacity for
the direction of vast affairs.
He has an informed view
of technological problems, a
precise and economical mode
of expression and a shrewd
appreciation of human na-
ture. Moreover, he has none
of the mental stiffness so
common in the banking fra-
ternity. No banker was more alert to
the need for reform fifteen years ago,
and no one from Wall Street was more
constructively helpful to the govern-
ment in early New Deal days. Some-
one who knew Lovett's great capacity
once recommended him to Roosevelt
for Under Secretary of the Treasury.
The suggestion was brushed off to the
great loss of the Administration.


THE qualities which the new Under
Secretary will bring to the specific
tasks of peacemaking are exactly what
are needed. Once more, the prob-
lem of peace centers in Europe. Russia
can be neutralized only if the European
Humpty-Dumpty can be put together
into a productive economic mechanism.
Secretary Marshall, despite his great
qualities, is untrained in economics. He
probably knows this and sought in
Lovett a top subordinate on whom he
could depend.

Lovett's orderly mind can provide
the finish and cohesion which our spotty
foreign policy so urgently needs. The
amebic growth of Russia can be met
only by the patient, intelligent build-
ing of firmly contained countries on
all sides. This will be the major test of
American statesmanship for a century
to come. But support to a broken world
cannot be given by a country which is
unhealthy within. The problem is not
Germany, Italy or China. It is the re-
creation of a world economy. Our for-
eign policy must keep an eye on our
own country as it carries on its labors
abroad. The new Under Secretary will
be a valuable agent in creating that
policy.
