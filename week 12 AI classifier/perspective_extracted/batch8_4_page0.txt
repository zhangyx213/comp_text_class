**The Unconquerable Yugoslavs**

by RAYMOND MOLEY

Recent dispatches indicating friction, and even fighting, between the Partisan and the Mikhailovitch forces in Yugoslavia, suggest that the only nation able to conquer that country may be the Yugoslavs themselves. Germany and Italy, combined, failed in that job even before Russia came into the war. No American can fail to pause in admiration at the fight these assorted Slavs have made in their trackless mountains.

The Serbian mountains are as strange to Europeans as the Himalayas and almost as difficult to penetrate. The German General Staff in the last war pondered an attack through Switzerland, but gave it up owing to their difficulties in getting through the Serbian mountains. That had been a fateful error, because although the Alps were known to every European tourist, no one knew the Serbian territory. The Austrians tried and failed. When the Germans finally came to their aid, it took about eighteen months to quiet the Serbs. The Imperial Armies had to take the country "square yard by square yard." Even this would have been impossible had Bulgaria not delivered its well-known stab in the back. But the strong Serbian forces in the mountains were never subdued, which suggests that the Yugoslavs will stand beside the Russians as unconquerable when this war is over.

Another item from 1918 history is important in present strategical considerations. When Bulgaria left the war in September 1918, the Serbs resumed the fight and greatly facilitated the march of the Allied armies from Salonika to the Danube by cutting off the German army which Mackensen had left in the Western Balkans. With this in mind, it would be well for the United Nations to find a way for the Yugoslavs to start killing Germans on a large scale, before they start exterminating each other.

Since the occupation of Austria five years ago, Hitler has tried bribery, threats and armed attacks on the Yugoslavs without success. He has handed over sizable pieces of Yugoslavia to Italy and Hungary, and he had set up Croatia and Montenegro as puppet states. But when spring flowers appear in the mountains, shooting always begins.

Mikhailovitch has become a legendary figure. He and the Partisans have kept alive armed resistance in the heart of Hitler's fortress. They have seized arms and supplies from Mussolini's occupying legions. Often they got the sinews of war from Italians by trading good Vardar tobacco for them. In disguise, Mikhailovitch has wandered all over the country, organizing resistance. No traitor has been found willing to betray him, although the Germans have been in the market with large sums for such aid. When the Germans have advanced into the foothills, they have found only farmers working peacefully. But when they start back for the cities, they have been shot from inaccessible mountain nests.

The Yugoslavs have suffered from this resistance, of course. Their propaganda agencies in this country say that, in two years, a million Yugoslavs have been killed. The Axis has made hanging a favorite sport, and hundreds of villages have been wiped out. But resistance continues.

So does the conflict, chiefly on ideological grounds, between Mikhailovitch and the Partisan army led by Josip Brozovich, better known as Tito. This is a real tragedy. The debate between the two groups rages even among the million or more Yugoslav-Americans here. It suggests the confusion that might have resulted in 1778, when Ben Franklin was working in Paris to get French aid, if Sam Adams and Tom Paine had suddenly appeared, denouncing Franklin, Hamilton and Washington as reactionaries and plutocrats. The affair is a very grim joke, to say the least.

In Churchill's tribute to the Yugoslavs last week, he carefully avoided mentioning either of the "patriot armies" by name. The British have worked with the exile government, in which Mikhailovitch is minister of war, but have tried to heal the breach between the Partisans and Mikhailovitch by persuading the exile government not to make their movement too strongly Serbian. According to Churchill, until now we have been unable to help except by airborne supplies and by sending officers and money. With the control of southern Italy in our hands, he added, a far-reaching vista of cooperation opens up.

The United States has followed the British diplomatic lead. This is exceedingly wise, for here, as in North Africa and Italy, ideology can afford to wait on military necessity.
