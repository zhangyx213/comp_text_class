**Oppenheimer at Harvard**

**by Raymond Moley**

J. ROBERT OPPENHEIMER has received the honor of an invitation by Harvard University to deliver the William James lectures in 1957.

Nearly a year ago a Harvard alumnus, Kenneth D. Robertson Jr., initiated a protest by correspondence with members of Harvard's Board of Overseers. This protest promises to grow as the time of the lectures approaches. The objection cited is that since Oppenheimer is an atomic scientist with no established reputation as a leader or scholar in the field of philosophy and ethics, he is not a suitable and qualified person to give these lectures. The objection is supported by the further contention that the conduct which the Atomic Energy Commission declared in 1954 to be due to "fundamental defects in his 'character'" should disqualify the scientist for such an academic honor or distinction.

Robertson had a long correspondence with Judge Charles E. Wyzanski Jr., chairman of the Board of Overseers. He sought to learn whether the overseers believed Oppenheimer to be qualified. So far, this quest seems to have been in vain. There are, in fact, contradictions as to whether the matter ever reached the overseers.

**MYSTERY**

The William James bequest was made by Edgar Pierce, who specified in a letter that the Department of Philosophy and Psychology should invite "eminent scholars not connected with Harvard University" to lecture for the benefit of students and others. Presumably the department's choice would be subject to the plenary authority of the Harvard Corp., a seven-member, self-perpetuating body including the president and treasurer of the university. The overseers are a more numerous body elected by the alumni, whose powers, if any, are advisory and whose function seems to be merely ornamental. The correspondence between Robertson and Wyzanski, however, seems to indicate that this body considers itself very august, and that whatever goes on in the governing circles of the university is nobody's business except that of the people directly concerned.


Since this is the official position of the university, it will be thought by some that any opinion put forth by this writer is presumptuous. But since the Pierce letter specifically decreed that the opinions of people "not connected with Harvard University" should be proper pabulum for Harvard students, a mild observation may be ventured.

It would seem that with the diverse and fascinating array of talent in philosophy and psychology here and abroad, someone other than a natural scientist might be found suitable to illuminate the subject which William James so greatly enriched.

**STRANGE CHOICES**

Instead of seeking illumination for students entrusted to its tutorial concern on a subject which its own President Eliot said dealt with "the real values of human existence," the university has chosen a man who was, as one alumnus wrote, "ignominiously wrong about the major political issue of our time." Oppenheimer as a citizen displayed egregiously fatal judgment in the selection of the causes he supported and the propagandists with whom he advised and associated. In addition, his devotion to the truth was, by his own confession utterly compromised. If this be serving "Veritas," Harvard should be more explicit in explaining its watchword.

It is also worthy of note that three recent Godkin lectureships at Harvard, which I believe are concerned with citizenship, were filled by Adlai Stevenson, Chester Bowles, and Hugh Gaitskell. Perhaps the wisdom of those who have been repudiated by the electorate is of a rare, esoteric sort unappreciated by any except Harvard authorities. Perhaps there is the more practical reason that lame ducks have more time to prepare and deliver lectures.

Can it be that Harvard is more concerned with repairing damaged careers than in the more prosaic task of pursuing and disseminating truth? Perhaps, like Hawthorne's Pyncheon family, Harvard is haunted by the faint smell of witches burned centuries ago and is obsessed by the belief that the public is always wrong.
