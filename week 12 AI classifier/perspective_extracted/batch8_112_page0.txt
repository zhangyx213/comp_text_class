**More About Inflation**

Q. *Citizen*: What does inflation mean to John
has. As this page pointed out last week,
there are two phases of inflation—each
characterized by a special fear. First there
is an urge to buy certain things because of
the fear that there may be no more of
these things to buy. Second there is the
urge to buy because of fear that the dol-
lar may soon buy less and less. First is
fear of scarcity. Second is the fear for the
value of money itself. The first is dis-
tressing. The second is dangerous. In the
second money flies into things, whether or
not the individual needs them. Savings in
terms of purchasing power (and how else
can their value be measured?) melt away.
Holders of insurance policies and deposi-
tors in savings banks are the classic vic-
tims. For precisely the same reason, the
millions insured in the Social Security sys-
tem would be hit. The salaries of white-
collar workers do not rise fast enough to
keep up with the grocery bill. Wage work-
ers cannot strike fast enough to make in-
come catch up with the cost of living.
The farmer is gouged whenever he tries to
buy what he needs. As people find that
the money they have saved or earned is
no longer generally accepted in exchange
for goods or labor, panic seizes them. The
stage is then set for dictators, disorder and
revolution.

We, in this country, are not likely ever
to have such a sweep of inflation as Ger-
many, France or other countries have en-
dured. We are bigger. We produce more.
We are less dependent upon the outside
world. But we have suffered some of the
consequences of inflation in the past, and
we may suffer them again in the future.
If and when we do, it will be the little fel-
low who is hurt most.

How can we tell when we are passing
from the first phase into the second phase?
Economists used to have well-defined ways
of gauging the transition. They looked at
such symptoms as the behavior of bond
prices, the behavior of stock prices, the
turnover of bank loans and the like. But
most of the traditional tests have ceased
to be valid in our economy. The many
controls that the government has over fi-
nance and industrial life throw the warn-
ing signals out of gear. The government
can lend and borrow in gigantic amounts.
It can support the bond market. Through
regulation, it has to some degree affected
the functioning of the stock market as an
indicator. Some of the very protections


we have set up have so retarded the ac-
tion of our barometers that, obviously, to
rely on them would be to wait until the
storm has broken. We must act long be-
fore that happens.

Is there a hedge against inflation? "One
of the clearest of the lessons taught by the
European experience is that there are no
good hedges against inflation," Leonard
P. Ayres, economist of the Cleveland
Trust Co., has pointed out. By their very
nature bonds, either corporate or govern-
ment, are not a hedge. While it is true
that stocks normally rise in times of infla-
tion, statistical studies show that the ad-
vance in their prices is vastly less than the
advance in the cost of living. More, there
are such enormous disparities in the size
of the advances of different kinds of stock
from one moment to the next that the
nimblest and most experienced specula-
tors are unlikely to be able to forecast
the market successfully. Even real estate,
commonly believed to be the safest invest-
ment during inflation, did not prove to be
an adequate hedge during the German and
French inflations. Ayres observes that in
the midst of the general destruction of
values in Germany, real estate fared rela-
tively well only by contrast. In France,
while values rose, they did not begin to
keep pace with the rise in the prices of
goods. Finally, speculation in the commod-
ity markets in times of inflation has proved
to be as hazardous for the individual as
speculation in the stock markets.

Is it possible, then, for the citizen to
save himself? No. Most articles and books
on inflation end by exhorting the citizen
to do this or that to prevent inflation.
They urge him, for example, to lend all
that he can to the government, or to hold
on to his government bonds, or to bear
greater taxes willingly, or to demand that
government economize, or to try to per-
suade his fellow farmers or fellow laborers
to forgo pressure for special gains, or to
resist the temptation to hoard commodi-
ties that are growing scarce. All these are
fine strictures. If all citizens would observe
them, there might be no inflation, or much
less inflation. But if human beings were
thus intelligent and unselfish, there would
be no war, no need for defense and, in
fact, very little need for government. We
should be something more than human.
To enjoin individuals, unaided, to take the
steps to save themselves from inflation is
simply to misunderstand what inflation is.
Inflation is human beings in panic, grab-
bing what they can. Its slogan is *sauve
qui peut*. Its destiny is chaos.


**NEWSWEEK JULY 21, 1941**

If we are to be saved from inflation, it
will not be by millions of individually wise
and unselfish decisions. Somebody will
have to save everybody. That somebody
is Congress and the President. When
the bank crisis came in 1933, those re-
sponsible for things in Washington did
not talk about difficulties of admin-
istration. Nor did they carry on a debate
with the grandstand. They acted with
vigor and courage. And the people blessed
them for it.

Since government must do what must be
done, what are the things to do? First,
pass the Federal Reserve recommendations
to limit the control pyramiding credit and
money.

Second, enact the Baruch plan to im-
pose a ceiling on all prices, wages and
rents, with the safeguards suggested by
Mr. Baruch and quoted on this page last
week. If, as our Price Administrator says,
the problem of administering this plan is
too great, remove him and get a better
administrator. His special training has not
been in administration in any event. We
have Baruch's word that the administra-
tion of the plan "should not present insu-
perable difficulties." If the Administration's
objection to the Baruch plan is that
some prices still need to rise in order to
induce greater production, and that "di-
rect price control measures should be em-
ployed only after it is reasonably clear
that no material increase in production
will result from an advance of price," then
the Administration is hopelessly bogged
down in theory. Then it does not really
know which it wants to do more—raise
prices or prevent inflation—and it cannot
proceed effectively until it makes up its
mind.

Third, impose excise taxes sufficiently
stiff to prevent the rush of money into ar-
ticles that compete with defense.

Fourth, widen the tax base, increase tax
rates severely enough to deflect a greatly
increased amount of money available for
spending and apply it to the hottest spot
of all—the mounting Federal debt.
It is not too late—but it is later than
the Administration thinks it is.

Inflation aside, what would a high price
structure mean to the future of the United
States? It would mean that we should lose
the peace regardless of who won the war.
If we are shackled to a high price struc-
ture when the nations resume trade, we
shall be beaten at the start in South
America and in other spheres of legitimate
trade. For the other nations will enter the
peace lean, hungry and accustomed to
lowered living standards. We, with our
higher costs of production, will be unable
to compete. England, Germany or Japan
cannot drive us out of South America, but
our own price structure can. We face
crashing deflation at home and insuperable
competition abroad unless we take reso-
lute action now.
