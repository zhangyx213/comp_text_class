**Who Owns the TVA?**

The President's decision to remove
Dr. Arthur Morgan from the TVA has
wholly changed the character and import
of the TVA controversy.

More important than the proof or dis-
proof of the charges of Dr. Morgan or
the countercharges of Harcourt Morgan
and David Lilienthal, more important
than the question of whether the Presi-
dent or Congress should investigate these
charges, more important than the ques-
tion of whether Dr. Morgan had the right
to refuse to divulge his testimony to the
President, is the question of whether the
President had the power to remove a
director, any director, of the TVA. For
if he has that power, then he has the
power to control the TVA. And if he has
the power to control the TVA, then he
also has the power to control any other
business enterprise authorized by Con-
gress. (The forthcoming coordination of
railroads is a case in point.)

Thus has the President, because of
haste, irritability and dependence upon
the legal opinions of puppet advisers,
made the tactical blunder of handing Dr.
Morgan the opportunity to carry his con-
test far beyond its original limits.

The President's memorandum to
Congress explaining his reasons for the
removal of Dr. Morgan rests, in essence,
on the following argument: The TVA is
an executive agency. As such, it is to be
classed with all the various and sundry
bureaus and departments over which the
President has authority. Therefore the
President's authority over the officers of
the TVA is superior to acts of Congress
providing for the tenure of these officers
and springs from his constitutional right
to "take care that the laws be faithfully
executed and . . . commission all the
officers of the United States." True, Con-
gress specified the grounds on which a
TVA board member could be removed
and, with one exception which is not here
in question, reserved for itself the right of
removal. But the President does not recog-
nize Congress' power to do so.

The specious opinion of Acting Attor-
ney General Jackson, which purports to
give legal color to this document, goes on
to add that inasmuch as the TVA is an
executive agency "the power of removal
ought to be in the President." Note
particularly here the word "ought." It
means that Mr. Jackson has not told the
President how Congress did legislate but

how Congress ought to have legislated.
In short, the President not only refuses
to recognize any distinction between the
head of the great TVA and a clerk in the
government service but informs Congress
that he challenges its power to describe
the conditions under which a TVA board
member may be removed.

Let us consider the validity of
these contentions, so far as laymen can,
although only the Supreme Court can
pass authoritative judgment on them.
The two most important cases in which
the Supreme Court has set forth the law
on this subject are the Myers case, de-
cided in 1926, and the Humphrey case, de-
cided eight years later.

In the Myers case the Court sustained
the President's right to remove a routine
administrative officer, a postmaster, on the
ground that a postmaster is "merely one of
the units in the Executive Department and
hence inherently subject to the exclusive
and illimitable power of removal by the
Chief Executive." It is interesting to note,
however, that Justices Holmes, Brandeis
and McReynolds dissented vigorously—in-
teresting in that the Administration law-
yers who have apparently appointed them-
selves the ideological executors of Holmes
hotly defend Morgan's removal. Justice
Holmes remarked in his dissent that the ar-
guments of the majority were "spiders'
webs inadequate to control the dominant
facts." The vastly more potent facts in the
Morgan case promise to strain to the ut-
most the web-spinning capacities of
those who regard Holmes as their prophet
and saint.

In the Humphrey case the Court made
a clear distinction between an executive
officer restricted to the performance of exec-
utive functions and a member of an inde-
pendent commission which exercises quasi-
legislative and quasi-judicial powers. Such
an officer, ruled the Court, could not be re-
moved except for cause—"cause" being
stipulated in the Federal Trade Commis-
sion Act.

Now the TVA is not a quasi-legal or
quasi-judicial body. It is a corporation,
created by Congress, which exists under
and by virtue of the Tennessee Valley
Authority Act of 1933, and whose in-
corporators are the Board of Directors
first appointed under the Act. As such, it
possesses vast powers—including, among
other things, the right to issue bonds with
the approval of the Secretary of the
Treasury, the right to sue and be sued
and the right to make and amend its by-
laws. And, as such, there is reason to be-

lieve that it possesses an even greater
degree of inviolability than the Federal
Trade Commission.

In the Humphrey decision, the Court
leaned upon three things in denying the
right of Mr. Roosevelt to remove a
Federal Trade Commissioner for a cause
not stated in the FTC Act—first, the
language of the Act itself; second, the
legislative reports on the bill; and third,
the general purpose of the legislation as
shown in the Congressional debates.

The very language of the TVA Act in-
dicates the intention of Congress to re-
move this corporation from Presidential
control. The directors are appointed for
nine years—a term mathematically fixed
to extend beyond the tenure of any Presi-
dent. Congress and Congress alone is
given the power to remove a member of
the board, by concurrent resolution, for
any cause or none, at any time. (Note: a
concurrent resolution, as distinguished
from a joint resolution, is not subject to
Presidential veto.) The President is given
the power of removal only if a board mem-
ber requires a political test in TVA ap-
pointments. That specific and limited
grant of power would indicate a deliberate
withholding of power to dismiss for any
other cause.

The legislative reports make still more
clear the determination of Congress to
protect the TVA from the prejudices and
caprices of any Executive. An illustrative
sentence from one of them reads: "The
Tennessee Valley Authority can have no
power or policy except as Congress pre-
scribes it."

And perhaps the best indication of
Congress' intention came from Senator
Norris, the father of the TVA, on the
floor of the Senate on March 16, 1938.
"The very theory of the Tennessee Val-
ley Authority Act itself," he said, "was to
make the organization independent of any
department, independent of any Presi-
dent . . ."

If, then, despite every precaution
Congress could take to protect the TVA
from the interference of any department or
President, the Executive still has the power
to remove its officers for any reason he sees
fit, then a great hunk of the insulation be-
tween the executive function and the legis-
lative function has been torn down. For
the unlimited power of removal is the un-
limited power of control.

This is the issue the President has pre-
cipitated. It is important not to Dr. Mor-
gan alone but to Congress and the nation.
Dr. Morgan ought, therefore, to sue for
his salary at the first possible moment.
And the Administration, if it is genuinely
anxious to settle the issue, will facilitate
the passage of the case through the lower
courts and speed it to the Supreme Court
with all the zeal that it brought to the
Electric Bond & Share case.
