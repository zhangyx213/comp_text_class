**Fact Finding or Fault Finding?**

On April 29, the President asked
Congress to institute a study of monopoly
and monopolistic practices. This was a
wholly reasonable request, considering how
little we have learned from nearly fifty
years of experiment under the antitrust
laws. It was unfortunate, as I remarked
last month on this page, that the request
was accompanied by comments revealing
basic prejudices and preconceptions on the
President's part. Yet the fact that the order
of the day was to be a study, rather
than the precipitate passage of ill-conceived
legislation, was reassuring.

But Congress' action in authorizing the
inquiry is anything but reassuring. It provided,
first of all, for a mixed legislative and
executive study board, thereby presenting to
the executive agencies represented on the
board drastic powers of inquiry which properly
belong only to legislative committees or to
permanent commissions responsible to Congress.
Then Senator King's effort to prevent two agencies
known for their disposition to inject political
and punitive tactics into their own investigations
from being represented on the inquiry was
defeated. And finally, as if these things were
not enough to insure the biased character of
the inquiry, the President was given control of
$400,000 of the $500,000 appropriated for
the study.

In these wholly extraordinary circumstances,
the study gets under way. It is not strange
that most observers are skeptical about the
impartiality of its work. Sophisticated people
know the political stake the Administration
has in what the inquiry "proves." Certainly its
findings can be politically useful in 1940. But
the party in power also faces an election in 1938—
and under the immense handicap of a depression.
By all the rules of politics, it ought to suffer
severe losses next fall—unless it can convince
the voters that private business, and not
government, is responsible for the stoppage of
business activity. As a starter, it has claimed
that the maintenance of rigid prices by monopolies,
overproduction and high-pressure salesmanship
precipitated the 1937 debacle. If it can document
this thesis with lurid examples and pound it
into the public consciousness through shrieking
headlines, it may minimize the traditional
reaction against a party in power during a depression.

These facts impose upon the executive members
and some of the legislative members of the
investigating body an almost resistless temptation
to make the inquiry the moral equivalent of a
criminal trial, with the inquirers as prosecutors
and with big business as the defendant at the bar
of public opinion. They all but guarantee the
politicalization of what ought to be an objective,
dispassionate examination—a guarantee that
could be discounted only in the event of two
exceedingly unlikely developments.

The first of these would be the deferring of all
except the preliminaries of the study until after
the election.

The second would be the selection of advisers and
committee and staff members who represent a
variety of economic faiths. Such men as Robert
H. Jackson, Thurman Arnold, Tom Corcoran,
David Coyle, Herman Oliphant and others of the
trust-busting and "distributist" schools should be
balanced by believers in the economic values of
large-scale business, by such men as Marriner
Eccles, Rex Tugwell, Donald Richberg, Hugh
Johnson and Jerome Frank.

Unfortunately, there is little hope for the sort of
self-restraint either of these moves would promise.

It is regrettable that this country has so rarely
achieved the type of investigation characteristic
of British and Canadian Royal Commissions.
Occasionally our governmental inquiries have done
sober and penetrating work. But, on the whole,
studies of highly controversial questions with
far-reaching political implications turn into
sensation hunts, as did the Pujo and Frank Walsh
inquisitions of twenty-five years ago.

There is much that a resolutely objective investigating
body could learn from a study of Canadian
anti-combines legislation and also from a study of
the inquiry into monopoly and prices conducted in
Canada a few years back. This inquiry arose from
sweeping attacks on chain stores, mail-order houses,
the textile and packing industries by Harry Stevens,
radical Minister of Trade and Commerce in the
Bennett Cabinet. Started as a Parliamentary committee,
it was later reconstituted as a Royal Commission. Of
its three reports, the best was a scholarly study by
the lone Farmer member. But both the majority
report, by Conservative members, and the minority
Liberal report contained much useful information. The
result of the inquiry was Bennett's series of
Herridge-inspired New Deal bills designed to control
wages and hours of work.


and fair-trade practices. Most of these measures were
subsequently declared unconstitutional by the Privy
Council. But the inquiry had a cleansing effect on many
business practices.

If our own investigators really get down to business,
there are a number of very great questions which
urgently require exploration and, if possible, solution.
Any intelligent study of the problems outlined in the
President's message will begin by distinguishing
between the concentration of business in the hands of
large corporations and the concentration of wealth in
individual hands; by recognizing that the antitrust
laws were never intended to redistribute wealth. It will
make a further distinction between monopoly and sheer
bigness. Resisting the theory that it is either desirable
or possible to create an economic world of freely
competing small units, it will make extensive studies of
the economies to be achieved by large-scale production,
large-scale distribution and centralized management.

Instead of assuming that big business should be broken
up, atomized, it will consider alternative methods of
control, where the need for control is indicated. It will
bear in mind that it is not necessary or possible to
achieve universal solutions: that there is no absolute
criterion of optimum size: that control of a stated
percentage of one type of industry is not comparable in
effect with control of the same percentage of another
industry: that if the rigidity of some prices is uneconomic,
so is the softness of others—notably those of the staple
agricultural commodities: and that, while businessmen
acting in groups naturally seek to keep prices up, there
are occasions when some sort of minimum price control
preserves rather than destroys competition.

It will approach its work from the viewpoint of the
"consumer," which, in the last analysis, means everybody,
rather than from the viewpoint of the "small businessman."
And, above all, it will forget those "moral" aspects of
the problem which only befog the real issues.

But, so great is the likelihood that a majority of the
investigators will start out with closed minds, intent on
proving that bigness is badness, that a parallel investigation
ought to be undertaken by such an impartial fact-finding
agency as the Brookings Institution or the Bureau of
Economic Research. Such agencies would not have the
immense investigative powers of the official inquiry. But
their independent findings and their nonpolitical interpretation
of data amassed by it would act as a corrective, protecting
the public against a priori conclusions and prejudiced
research.
