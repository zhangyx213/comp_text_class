Young Republicans

by RAYMOND MOLEY

WHILE the cheers ring out for the
great and notable in the Republi-
can Party and while that party is warm
in anticipation of victory, let us turn
the page to a little-known soldier of
the party’s long march through the
desert.

Back in early 1936 when, as Gov.
Dwight Green said in his keynote, the
party in disaster after defeat was lit-
erally “driven back to the
county line,” Richard No-
winson, in his 20s, started
a little magazine called *The
Republican*. It was a daring
venture supported by little
except the idealism of its
youthful editor. When the
initial copy, published in
Chicago, came to this desk,
it was an eyebrow raiser.
Political magazines had long
been out of date, and their history
had been marked by failure. More-
over, this was a periodical dedicated
to the fortunes of no rising party
but to an old and badly battered
one.

But there was no wish in Dick No-
winson’s mind to glorify the old and
reactionary. He believed in two-party
government at a moment when the
trend seemed to be going toward
one-party, one-man governments every-
where, except in the British Common-
wealth.

Nowinson says that his project rested
on a few simple propositions: that mil-
lions of voters still shared the early
ideals of the Republican Party; that
basic Republican principles needed re-
statement in the light of new condi-
tions; that there was no unity of
principle in the old party; that millions
of young men and women were coming
of age who could only dimly remember
a Republican President.

Later, when strong Republican gov-
ernors began to appear, the magazine
told of their achievements. And as the
Republican membership in Congress
grew, it offered information about what
it was doing.

Nowinson has been doing all this
constructive work with little material
return. After twelve years, he still
labors with undiminished faith in his
little offices in Chicago. He
has the satisfaction of trav-
eling with the forward-look-
ing members of his party
back from the “county line”
to the shadow of the White
House. He deserves support,
for his job is just beginning.
The Republican Party not
only needs watching in vic-
tory, but it needs direction,
interpretation and advice.

The present and prospective ascend-
ancy of the party is a tentative sanc-
tion. It is based upon a widespread
reaction against the Administration
now in power. The war and only the
war spared Roosevelt from that reac-
tion. Truman is getting the full force
of accumulated dissatisfaction, plus
plenty of additional exasperation which
he himself has caused.


MILLIONS of young people are going
to enter the Republican Party
with reservations. They want to be-
lieve the promises of the spokesmen
and the platform of this convention.
They want the invigorating atmosphere
of economic freedom, of a more efficient
public service, relief from obtrusive and
scolding authority, a smarter, more ef-
fective diplomacy and constructive ac-
tion concerning the cost of living. Their
tentative vote of confidence can be re-
viewed. It can even be withheld if the
campaign bogs down.

These young voters want no tribal
tub thumping and mystic incantations
from those old Republican medicine
men who prevailed in the days of nor-
malcy. There were occasional and rath-
er ominous signs in Philadelphia that
those relics conceived this to be the
year of personal resurrection. Victory,
however, will depend upon youth.
More voters have come of age since
Nowinson started out than all those
who voted for Hoover and Smith
twenty years ago. They want a change,
but the right kind of change.

Newsweek, June 28, 1948

The polls showed that the GOP
failed to interest young people. The
pied pipers of the New Deal were play-
ing the tune of a brave new world. The
GOP was billed as an old man’s party.
The Republican won new interest in
the party as it struggled along. It con-
tributed to a better-informed party
membership. It told party leaders what
the people in the ranks were thinking.
It told the rank and file what their
leaders were like. It helped crystallize
policy in nation and state.
