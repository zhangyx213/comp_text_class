**War and the New Deal**

by RAYMOND MOLEY

What has been the influence of our
New Deal upon the war? And, equally
important to Americans, what has been
the influence of the war upon the New
Deal?

Perhaps never before has a domestic
political credo so affected the announced
objectives of an international conflict. To
realize this, we need only compare the
announced objectives of 1918 with those
of 1941 and 1942.

In 1918, the war aims of the associated
nations were phrased by Woodrow Wil-
son. His was the most potent and re-
spected voice in the world, partly be-
cause of his skill with words, partly be-
cause he was the head of the one nation
with no territorial ambitions, and partly
because our hard-pressed associates were
in no position to object to an American
statement of aims. Wilson was only in
very minor degree a social reformer, and
was interested in economic reform chiefly
as it affected freedom of trade within the
nation and among the nations.

So the Fourteen Points were essential-
ly the faith of a nineteenth-century lib-
eral—a constitutionalist and a believer in
political freedom and political democracy.
They dealt with open diplomacy, free-
dom of the seas, disarmament, self-de-
termination, a recognition of nationalism
in Europe and the Near East, and, final-
ly, an association of nations to guarantee
some sort of peaceable international or-
der in future. These aims had to do with
free political institutions and with na-
tional independence. Under the Wilson
philosophy, how the people chose to deal
with their domestic economics or with
their internal social problems was of no
concern to other nations.

But even while Wilson was speak-
ing, there was growing here and in other
countries another view of governmental
functions. In many nations in Europe—
autocracies as well as democracies—and
in our own states and cities, government
was beginning actively to promote good
health, relief of various sorts and "equal-
ity of opportunity." Ultimately, in 1932,
this view of government became the pro-
gram for a successful national party here.
With the wisdom of all or any of the
measures the New Deal adopted we are
not here concerned. Suffice it to say that
the people of America accepted the broad
assumption that a government must as-


sure its citizens something more than
political freedom.

It was in the nature of things for Pres-
ident Roosevelt to urge his socioeconomic
philosophy as a war objective. The terms
of the Atlantic Charter make clear the
trend. Six of its eight articles follow the
Wilson line. But in two, there appears a
pledge of collaboration among nations to
secure "improved labor standards, eco-
nomic adjustment and social security,"
and "freedom from fear and want."

Here is the New Deal defined in world
terms. The Roosevelt Four Freedoms,
declared in January 1941, followed the
same line.

It is not useful now to speculate on
whether political independence is com-
patible with an international effort to
enforce individual rights within states.
It is enough to note that the expressed
objectives of this war include those of
the New Deal. This is a big achievement
for a domestic program only nine years
old, in a country which was at peace
when the objectives were accepted.

So much for the influence of the
New Deal upon the war. What, mean-
while, has been the effect of the war
upon the New Deal?

When the war started in 1939, Con-
gress had passed much of the sort of leg-
islation which experience in the states
and in enlightened countries abroad had
shown to be sound. New Deal reformers
had reached a fork in the road. Sharp left
was the way to Communism through the
rapid extension of government enterprise
in production, transportation and min-
ing. More gently bending to the left was
another road—the road of accelerated
spending and lending. This was lightly
surfaced with specious economic argu-
ments. Those who commended it said
that it really led to greater production
and that it preserved private enterprise.
It was unavailing to point out, as many
did, that this road ultimately joined the
Communistic road, because the accept-
ance of the spend-lend theory would, in
the end, destroy private enterprise. So
far as any foundations for a new do-
mestic New Deal appeal in the election
of 1940 were laid, they pointed to this
course, which had been documented in
the hearings of the Temporary National
Economic Committee and reinforced in
successive presidential statements.

Then war came. Money was needed
for defense. Unemployment was shrink-
ing. The President turned to his military
advisers. In a few months, the cohorts of
domestic reform began to drop out of the
news, except for a few, like Hopkins, who
were called to major war tasks. Numbers
of them found berths in war agencies.
Others joined planning agencies. Labor
and the farmers had no new panaceas
and were, in the main, contented with
the demand that "gains" should not be
sacrificed, which was good evidence that
the high-water mark of legislative salva-
tion had been temporarily reached.

Those New Dealers not directly con-
cerned in war have made postwar plan-
ning their passion. Basically, their form-
ulas are still the same, but new measures
are deferred until peace comes. On the
political side, they have become fairly
hardened realists. With little of the glam-
or of early idealism, their behavior now
resembles that of any political regime
long in office, whose primary interest is
maintaining power.

That the war's end will see a retreat
from the essential New Deal philosophy
is unthinkable. Its main postulates will
be accepted by any regime which suc-
ceeds the present one. What is sound in
it is no longer a party issue; it is a na-
tional conviction. It is fortified in our
jurisprudence by a new and youthful Su-
preme Court. But the domestic problems
which will confront us as the war pro-
gresses, and which will be no less urgent
at its end, may well bring into office,
both appointive and elective, people of a
tougher fiber and surer intelligence than
some who were there when the war came.
A thousand resentments may turn the
public against the "ins" on the domestic
front, while it becomes more and more
clear that the gains of labor and agri-
culture depend, fundamentally, upon the
preservation of the system of private en-
terprise and its great productive capacity.
To avoid chaos and reaction, our course
of public policy must necessarily recog-
nize that interdependence.

The war has taught Americans for the
first time that their resources are not
without limit. A misguided economic poli-
cy after the war could break them, just
as the strain of war has bent them. That
may be one of the most useful lessons we
are learning from this ordeal.
