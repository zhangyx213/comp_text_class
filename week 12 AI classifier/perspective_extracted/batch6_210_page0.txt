Three Wars

by Raymond Moley

SANTA BARBARA, CALIF. When the
Eisenhower Administration and
the Republican 83rd Congress took
office in January they inherited not
one but three wars. One was a bloody,
shooting affair in Korea. Another, a
cold, sometimes lukewarm, conflict
between the government and Ameri-
can business. The third was a snarling,
rancorous antagonism between two of
the coordinate branches of
our government, the Execu-
tive and the Congress. At
the half-year mark, it may
be appropriate to measure
the achievement of the
President and the Congress
on the basis of what has
been done to terminate
these conflicts.

The Korean mess permit-
ted of no glorious outcome.
It was a war whose inception lay in
gross neglect, plunged into on an im-
pulse and destined inevitably to end
in an impasse. Any substitute for vic-
tory was bound to be bitter frustration
and humiliation. Perhaps we had to
learn as Washington had to learn in
the American Revolution that a war
cannot be run by a debating society.
Collective security must be an alli-
ance. It cannot be a council of assorted
nations. The Truman regime deliber-
ately chose to foreclose victory for
American arms. When Mr. Eisenhower
took over the moment for possible vic-
tory had passed. Perhaps it was the
death of Stalin that caused Mao to
propose new negotiations, but it can-
not be denied that in the administra-
tion of foreign relations and in the
conduct of the war, Mao must have
seen the signs of firmer and more
experienced hands.

Since the Administration of F.D.R.
was born in the midst of a great busi-
ness depression, the responsibility for
which was to some degree the result
of financial excesses, it was easy for
the President and his party to use that
vague entity known as "business" as a
villainous antagonist in a political mo-
rality play in which the President cast
himself as the heroic protagonist. This
role so skillfully played by Roosevelt
was more crudely but surely assumed
by his successor. The simple question
of whether public or private enter-
prise would better serve the public
was never suggested. The govern-
ment was always unselfish and effi-
cient, private enterprise always the
profitmonger. Mr. Eisenhower and the
present Congress have simply deter-
mined that when a service can be
performed by private initiative, be it
the production of electric power or
the making of rubber, by private capi-
tal and at the risk of private, not tax-
payers' dollars, it should be done that
way. In short, business has
been given a chance to per-
form the function for which
it was devised, government
is content to reserve the
function of judge and regu-
lator. When a businessman
can be had to work in a gov-
ernment job for which his
experience pre-eminently
fits him, Mr. Eisenhower has
had the simple, sound judg-
ment to employ him. And we have
seen removed from the businessman a
stigma which he never deserved.
A man high in the hierarchy of Con-
gress recently remarked that for the
first time in twenty long years we have
a President who recognizes that Arti-
cle I, Section 1 of the Constitution
vests the legislative power in Congress
and that in a republic the legislative
power is the essential repository
of human liberty. There is something
in the very nature of President
Eisenhower that holds high this Con-
stitutional relationship. Roosevelt pri-
vately and subtly, but with persistent
intent, sought to dominate Congress.
Truman made Congress his antagonist
in every campaign. Mr. Eisenhower
with almost Lincolnesque patience ac-
cords even the most truculent the
consideration due a representative of
the sovereign people.

This new relationship is not entirely
the creation of the President. The
leaders of Congress deserve a full
measure of respect for their part.
Many a member has restrained his
impulse to vote against the President's
measures in order to maintain this co-
operative effort. And it must be added
that many Democrats too have caught
the new spirit.

There have been errors and fum-
bles; there has been a rate of progress
that has inspired some impatience
among those who expected miracles;
but the net has been reassuring.
