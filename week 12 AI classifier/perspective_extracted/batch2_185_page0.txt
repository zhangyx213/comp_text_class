**PERSPECTIVE**

**Government by Pollsters**

by Raymond Moley

I HAVE frequently commented in this
space on what I have called "feedback"
statesmanship. By that I mean
the growing tendency of many members
of Congress to justify their support of
one measure or another by
citing opinions other than their own.
This is especially marked in providing
arguments through some kind of opinion
poll of constituents which the
member or some agency has taken.
Polls provide most convenient foxholes
for the timid and for those who
cannot think for themselves. Opinion
polls can be and generally are to be
seriously doubted. The answers depend
upon how the questions are
worded, upon who is polled, who is
submitting the questions, and who
analyzes the returns.

An excellent example is a poll just
submitted to school-board members
over the country, on the subject of
Federal aid to education. Last year
it was a sore blow to the Kennedy
school-aid bill when the news came
out in May that the Delegate Assembly
of the National School Boards Association
(NSBA) had voted against
"further extension of Federal aid to
education." However, in the same resolution
it was provided that the NSBA
board of directors "ascertain without
delay the thinking of school-board
members" on the subject.

No sooner had the President's plan
been rejected by the House than
there were vigorous efforts to get a
vote for Federal aid through the authorized
polling of school boards. The
NEA, along with the American Association
of School Administrators, began
working on the NSBA.

**LEADING QUESTIONS**

In May the Wyoming delegation,
which offered the resolution, wanted
a simple question to be submitted:
"Do you want any further extension
of Federal aid to education?" But
those who were planning the survey
got up a four-page questionnaire containing
an elaborate series of carefully
prepared questions. I have the
original and the final draft before me.
Nothing could be more perfectly designed
to get a vote agreeable to the
exponents of Federal aid. We can
easily imagine how vigorously teacher
members of the NEA or school administrators
in thousands of communities
will plan to get the "right"
school-board member to give the
"right" answers.

The trial questionnaire went out in
November to school boards in three
states—Georgia, Oregon, and Indiana.
It is clear that the first two of those
states, through their legislatures and
otherwise, favored Federal aid. Indiana
did not.

**OMITS VITAL FACTS**

The final draft of the questionnaire,
just sent to all school boards, leads
the respondent through a series of
questions to get him committed to
some or all of the present forms of
Federal aid. After the respondent has
committed himself on these programs, he
is asked the $64 question about
further Federal financing.

This puts the respondent in a real
predicament. If he has admitted that
his school district is now taking Federal
assistance for vocational education,
school lunches, under the
NDEA, or as a "federally impacted
area," how can he say to subsequent
questions that he is against Federal
aid generally? The questionnaire,
however, asks no questions that would
provide any evidence of need for such
assistance—tax sources used or available,
bonding power available or possible
through state action, the breadth
of the tax base for schools, or increased
efficiency through school-district
reorganization. A number of "iffy"
questions follow: If there is general
Federal support passed by Congress,
should the assistance be given
to non-public schools? If there is to be
additional Federal support, in what
way do you want it given?

School boards everywhere—not single
board members—should prepare
their responses on the basis of full and
free debate, reviewing their prerogative
to shape the course of education
and evaluating the adequacy of their
local and state resources.

When this was done recently among
school boards in the state of New
York, the final vote reported to their
state school-board association was 431
opposed and only 80 for further Federal
intervention. This is a decision
now facing 100,000 school-board
members across the country.
