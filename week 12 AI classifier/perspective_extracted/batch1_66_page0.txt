**AUTOMOTIVE SAFETY-V**

**BY RAYMOND MOLEY**

A utomotive safety will be one of the
three or four most important sub-
jects of public concern in 1966. Sena-
tor Ribicoff's subcommittee has taken
a large volume of testimony over the
past year, and President Johnson has
a plan for Federal action. None of
the evidence so far has changed the
order of responsibility for improve-
ment: first, the driver, next, the
various government agencies which
construct, maintain and police the
roadways and, finally, the makers of
the cars.

But since the manufacturing com-
panies are so few and so easily identi-
fied, Sen. Robert Kennedy has made
irresponsible and inaccurate charges
against them. On the other hand,
members of the Administration, nota-
bly Secretary of Commerce Connor
and former Secretary of HEW Cele-
brezze, have defended the industry.

The modern car is the product of
engineering evolution. Virtually every
improvement has had something to
do with safety. The engineers must
learn by experience. For example,
fifteen years ago it was believed that
in a crash it was better to permit the
occupants of a car to be thrown out.
Then it was found that it was safer to
keep them in. And that discovery
concentrated attention on what hap-
pens within the car when a collision
takes place.

**INDUSTRY'S CONTRIBUTIONS**

For decades the companies have
maintained immense proving grounds
and indoor laboratories where every
conceivable situation that a car meets
on the highways can be controlled
and studied. When these tests have
shown the need for improvements,
such improvements have been built
into the car. An indeterminate but
vast amount of talent and money has
been spent in this testing. Questions
from Senator Kennedy about how
much has been spent on safety alone
pose an unanswerable bookkeeping
problem. For all engineering is de-
signed to protect the driver and his
car. In 1964 the industry spent half a
billion dollars on improving durability,
reliability and safety.

The companies have gone far be-
yond improving the car. They have
provided valuable models of highway
construction for state and Federal
agencies. The companies have fos-
tered driver education by providing
equipment for the schools and pro-
moting safe driving through films,
booklets and advertising for the
schools and general public.

But improvements must come year
by year, and half the cars in use are
more than six years old. Cars need
proper maintenance and care. That is
the responsibility of the owners. Un-
safe cars should be kept off the road-
ways. That is the responsibility of the
various governments.

**FEDERAL INTERESTS**

A small car cannot be as safe in a
crash as a big one. But the demand,
stimulated by the invasion of our mar-
kets by small cars from abroad, has
created serious problems of safe con-
struction for the industry. And those
foreign cars constitute a considerable
number of the cars on the highways.

Recently designs of "safe" or "fool-
proof" cars have been suggested. But
such cars-still on imaginative drawing
boards and therefore never tested as
present models have been-would be
so costly and impractical that they
would scarcely find a market.

Some Federal agencies, such as the
GSA and Post Office, have recently
specified certain safety features to be
installed in the vehicles they buy.
Most of these features are already
standard equipment on all cars. Gen-
eral Motors has announced that an
energy-absorbing steering column and
dual braking system will be standard
on all its 1967 passenger models.

The industry recognizes and wel-
comes Federal interest in providing
safer cars and its leadership in Fed-
eral, state and local highway construc-
tion. The Federal government can
also enlarge its already considerable
programs of research in automotive
safety. There is a limited but im-
portant opportunity for Federal
influence, direct or indirect, in stand-
ardizing requirements for driver
registration and periodic car inspec-
tion. Most states are lagging in these
respects. In all these efforts, the in-
dustry is ready and willing to help.
What is needed is more cooperation
and less buck-passing. In a highly
competitive market, the companies
need help rather than criticism from
Congress and the Administration.
