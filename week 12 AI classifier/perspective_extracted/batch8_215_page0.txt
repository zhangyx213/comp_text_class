**What It Means to Us**

All our calculations on what a war would mean to us, as well as all considerations of our national life under the "peace" that must follow this war of nerves or of nerves and blood, must be revised in the light of the German-Russian rapprochement. It is, even beyond the outcome of armed war, a determining fact in the world and in our national life as well. It touches our government policies, our national defense problems, our economic and political life, our social responsibilities, our habits of thought, and our responsibilities, as citizens, to one another. It affects labor, agriculture, industry, finance, education, racial relations, religious affiliations and political alignments. It may well be the most significant world event since the army of Napoleon crumpled at Waterloo.

It may take years to determine exactly what the changes thus compelled will be. But every American may well ponder the significance of this new world balance and participate intelligently in the forming of the new national psychology that seems to be in order.

The course to be pursued by the legislative and executive branches of our government must be guided by our immediate and ultimate national necessities. The decisions which will be made in Washington to protect us must result from compromises of extreme positions and from calm, reasonable adjustments between the Executive and the Senate. The President might well place large responsibility for such adjustments upon Secretary Hull, who has the confidence of the Senate and of the country—a confidence based upon his genuinely peaceful disposition and his long experience with Congress.

While at the moment it seems that the Administration wants the repeal of all neutrality legislation, such a repeal may be difficult, considering the state of public opinion. The days when Americans could be protected while traveling on belligerent ships, and when American shipments in war zones could be guaranteed, ended with the last war. The cash-and-carry principle may well be the basis of agreement between the two branches of government.

The avoidance of a war boom of unhealthy dimensions cannot be guaranteed, but such a boom can be wisely limited. Events of the next days or weeks may make inevitable the lifting of the arms embargo, which could hardly be effective for a long period in any event. A realistic appraisal of American opinion with reference to war in Europe is that an overwhelming majority want Germany to lose and an equally large majority want us to avoid active military participation.

We should not forget, now that the play of power in the Eastern Hemisphere is so hopelessly confused, that our concern is with an axis that runs from north to south, from Pole to Pole through the middle of the Western Hemisphere. It should be an axis of accord, of self-defense and of mutual aid and self-respect. We can, if we will, live in this Hemisphere behind impregnable naval and air defenses. These will be costly, but they are indispensable. Canada will be closer to us as the years pass. Our destinies are alike, our ideals related, our safety inseparable. This doesn't mean political union (that would be silly and unnecessary) but unity in trade and cultural relations.

Our interest in the problems of Latin America must be quickened manyfold. Mexico can no longer hope for important commercial relations with Germany now that Germany has turned to the East and, under war conditions, would be effectively cut off from the Western World. It is hard to see how the more radical elements in Mexico can maintain their supremacy in the face of the Russian-German alliance. Moderation may come there and in other Latin-American states, bringing with it better relations with us.

Our Pacific policy will be governed by many imponderables and many uncertainties. Our navy there must be strong enough for any contingency. Governmental, as well as public opinion generally may favor our staying in the Philippines indefinitely, particularly if our relations with Japan improve. It is likely that Japan will be more tractable and more willing to trade her Chinese ambitions for closer relations with the other two great naval powers. Great Britain has associated herself with Japan before on a mutual basis of self-interest, and we could hardly view such a combination as inimical to our interests. We cannot well drive Japan into a monstrous new alliance with Germany and Russia.

Along with economic calculations must be considered the fact that a general European war is likely to be a very long war. If the Russian pact holds, Germany cannot well be starved out. No navy can blockade Eurasia. If the conflict involves great rival imperialistic powers, neither side can yield until resistance becomes impossible, and with resources divided as they are, the limit of resistance will be very broad. Revolution is less likely now that the true incompatibility of Communism and democracy has been demonstrated and radical fronts in the democracies are broken.

The rout of the radical front in all of the democracies is, with the Stalin-Hitler tie, complete. This is of incalculable importance in the domestic affairs of this country. The only feeble excuse radicals are offering is that Stalin is not binding himself to anything. Apparently their faith is so great that they believe he will double-cross even his new friends. This is one conflict the radicals cannot blame upon capitalism. The Communist party as a propaganda agency in this country is washed up. The twin idea that the world must decide between Communism and Nazism is also out. They are, to borrow an old saying, two wings of the same bird of prey. Sound, moderate opinion, devoted to American institutions and traditions, will be the compass for Americans in this crisis and for years to come. The hamstringing of business can and inevitably must stop, for, on the material side, what our industry can and does produce is all that can protect us from outside attack and internal distress.

It is in conformity with our institutions that Congress, with the advice of the Executive, should lay down the main lines of policy, if it is called because of war in Europe. The Executive should be held to strict accountability for abiding by the letter and spirit of such policies. It is to be hoped that the Executive branch of the government will be on constant guard against actions, speeches and decisions likely to involve us in hostilities. We must be on our guard against sentimental talk about saving the world for democracy. We must save ourselves for democracy. We have properly made every effort to exercise moral influence on the side of peace. We have not been notably successful. It may be that our national sympathies are clear and well known, but the duty of responsible officials must be to allay emotions, not to incite them.

We are a democracy and we still shall cherish the right to differences of opinion and the right to express them. But on essentials we need unity—the unity of labor, employers, government and all the other interests and forces that constitute our national life. Our own is the only form of government and life that has proved itself able to protect its people without enslaving them. And that form of government is not a pinkish collectivism, but a republic based upon free enterprise and civil liberty. That we must protect and cherish.
