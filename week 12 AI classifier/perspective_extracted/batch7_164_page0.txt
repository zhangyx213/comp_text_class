**NO. 1: He Did Come Back**

They never come back. This maxim was as inviolable in Republican politics as in boxing. No Republican Presidential nominee, once defeated, had ever won the White House. In fact, not one had even been nominated again.

To Thomas E. Dewey on the morning after Election Day in 1944, this maxim was interesting, but hardly relevant. His piercing brown eyes had been fixed on the Presidency ever since he was old enough for the job. Their gaze had remained steadfast despite three sharp setbacks which would have finished the political career of a less ambitious, less resolute man: (1) As Manhattan's crusading prosecutor, he lost his biggest case before he won; (2) seeking the New York governorship, he lost before he won; and (3) aiming at the GOP Presidential nomination, he lost before he won.

Now, after a fourth setback for the biggest political prize in the United States, Dewey's eyes did not shift from the White House. To a man who had made a career of rising above defeat, who had a seemingly infinite capacity for analyzing his reverses and plotting a course which would avoid old pitfalls, another four-year wait did not seem very long.

Further, time was on his side. Dewey would still be only 46 years old when the 1948 campaign rolled around. With complete confidence he could recall that each failure had only added to his fame; each

**Victory for Management and Logic**

by RAYMOND MOLEY

SOMEONE said, while praising Dewey's political managers, that with such management Taft could have been nominated. This would undoubtedly have been true, but only if Dewey himself had been one of the managers. For a fact not generally understood is that Dewey is as much a manager on the political side as he is a policymaker on the ideological side. He is a born manager and administrator.

I don't know how long Dewey has wanted to be President. Surely, ten years—possibly more. In those ten years he has pursued his objective with a clear consistency which should have been a warning to those commentators who expected his strength to melt after an initial burst of strength. Brownell, Sprague, Jaeckle and, of equal importance, Paul Lockwood have been with him all that time, with a slight 1941 case of detachment for Jaeckle. Those who have been saying that Dewey is cold and ungrateful should note this mutual devotion. This is also true of his group of policy helpers—Bell, Dulles, Burton, Keller, Breitel and others.

Such continuity means skill in the original choices, for these are all smart people. It also means warmth and security in the mutual relations of all. There are no crossed wires, no office factions, no paralyzing confusions of decision. Each knows what he is to do, and each knows that no unknown commitments or assignments will frustrate his efforts. There were mixups even in great camps like those of Wilson and F.D.R.

Newsweek, July 5, 1948

To witness the two battles of Oregon and Philadelphia was to see a great principle in politics revealed once more. As in almost every other activity, clear thinking and hard, consistent, unruffled effort pays best. In both places Stassen had abounding enthusiasm; Dewey, abiding watchfulness. The latter won. In national politics the man who knows the most right people in most states has a heavy advantage. Dewey and his people gained this the hard way, but they worked at it for ten years and they used every setback to teach themselves a new lesson.

AGAINST this, the bumbling old-style Brown management in Taft's behalf was powerless. Dewey's half-veiled predictions of delegate strength were always understatements. Brown's were gross and palpable overclaims. Four weeks ago, I studied Brownell's personal calculations, state by state. The Dewey estimate of Taft strength was amazingly accurate. But Dewey was underestimated. After studying the Dewey figures, I noted in this column two weeks ago that Taft would have 225 on the first ballot. He received 224. Stassen was set down at 140. He received 157.

But a candidate cannot win in the face of unfavorable forces operating beneath the surface fluff and foam. Beneath all else in the past month or two there could be read the probability of Dewey's nomination. The very fact that so many people who wanted someone other than Dewey were predicting a deadlock made their judgments suspect. The delegates were not fools. They had seen the disastrous results of a deadlock eight years ago. They were, in the main, determined to prevent a repetition. To move to Dewey was the easiest way to prevent it, for the very simple reason that he had most votes.

Stassen made a remarkable campaign, but in the past month there was evidence, notably in Oregon, of fatigue in his judgments. Also, the constant talk of a Vandenberg-Stassen ticket hurt. Somehow, the impression was created that Stassen was running for Vice President. There was never real vitality in what was called by one of the promoters the Vandenberg "underground." There was no real Vandenberg sentiment except in Washington, D.C., New York City and Michigan. The results showed that.

THE so-called coalition was a great bust, because it was based on the false idea that Taft would help a movement to nominate someone like Vandenberg or Warren—men who were further from him ideologically than Dewey. The Warren nomination was utterly logical. Warren has enormous strength all over the West. Logic, good sense on the part of delegates and superior organization won.
