Democratic Gloom in New York

by RAYMOND MOLEY

The death of Sidney Hillman
doubles the political woes of the New
York Democrats. Mr. Hillman was a
political genius of sorts. In New York
he used his big union to organize the
American Labor party. He built the
PAC, by the same method, through
the CIO. His European background
gave him mastery of the technique of
political infiltration of unions and parties
by small but virile
groups of followers. His
ideology was not Communistic, but his
political
methods borrowed liberally
from abroad. After Hillman's illness
became more
serious, things were not the
same, either in the national
PAC or the New York
ALP. To his disciples and
political allies, Hillman was
not an expendable man.

The blow will fall heaviest on the
Democratic party in New York State,
where Governor Dewey will certainly
be a candidate to succeed himself.
Since his defeat for the Presidency,
Dewey has taken little part in national
politics. He is a trim, serious
administrator who loves details. It
takes a long time to get the results of
such virtue over to the public. They
don't make headlines. But painstaking
effort ultimately comes to public consciousness. That has happened in
Dewey's case. People say they don't
know much about it, but "Dewey
seems to be a good governor." A man
who creates that impression is hard
to attack and hard to beat.

Dewey is not always tactful, and for
a considerable time he was not well
liked in the legislature and in the state
Republican organization. Six months
ago, it looked as if he could not be
reelected.

At that time, the Democratic leaders
made a great mistake. They decided
informally to run against Dewey
the Hon. James M. Mead, junior
United States senator from New York.
Now it appears, at this late date, that
there is no other suitable candidate,
and the Democrats are very, very
much afraid that their man can't make
the grade.

The weaknesses of Mead should
have been apparent all the time. His
ascent to the Senate was achieved at
a time when all that a New York
Democrat needed was to end all
speeches with a ringing eulogy of the
great humanitarian in the White
House. Now Mead stands on his own.
He is handsome and affable. But he
has no imagination and no punch. He
touches all the political bases-especially when he is on first and the next
batter hits a home run. But he is not
what my colleague, John Lardner,
would call a power, hitter.

Both parties are short of Senatorial
eligibles. The Democrats
may run ex-Governor Lehman, who
would not draw
as he did when he ran for
governor. The Republicans
are talking about Irving
Ives, an able but not well-known
Republican assembly
leader. John Foster Dulles,
international lawyer and advisor to
various UN activities, is a possibility.
It is the
patronage of the governor's office which
interests political organizations, and
there the Republicans
have the advantage.

New York Democracy is troubled
with ills-some are new; some are old.
There has never been a healing of the
wounds caused when James A. Farley
veered away from the New Deal. Four
years ago, an open fight developed
over the nomination for governor, and
Farley's man won. Then Dewey beat
Farley's man.

The old New York Democratic shibboleths, so effectively used by Al
Smith, Robert Wagner and F. D.
Roosevelt, are worn thin. Social legislation and the like are here, and everybody accepts them. There isn't much
speechmaking material in settled
issues.

Tammany Hall is the sick man of
New York. It is in weak hands and is
rocked with dissension. The boss of
Brooklyn, Frank V. Kelly, has just
died. The left-wing parties, already
badly split, may, with Hillman's
death, utterly disintegrate. Only in the
Bronx, where E. J. Flynn holds the
reins, are conditions good. But you
can't win a state election with one
healthy county.

President Truman is not very
popular in New York. Labor is cold
because of his emergency action; management is cold because he vetoed
the Case bill. Small shopkeepers have
no love for the OPA. And there is no
Roosevelt name to work its magic.
Things may change, but now all is
gloom in the New York Democracy.
