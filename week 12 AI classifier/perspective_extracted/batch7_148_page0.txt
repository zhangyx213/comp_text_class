Et Tu, Ohio?

by RAYMOND MOLEY

THE most ironical feature in the
great upset of Nov. 2 comes to
light in a study of what happened in
the rural sections of the Midwest.
Ohio, the state that clinched Presi-
dent Truman's victory, offers concrete
and detailed evidence. It is the best
answer I have seen to the big post-
election question: "What happened?"
The Columbus Dispatch took a poll
in eighteen Ohio counties be-
fore the election. It showed
a Dewey vote of 53.5 per
cent, and the result was
52.3 per cent in those coun-
ties. This poll showed, how-
ever, that the Wallace vote
would be 2.3 per cent, and
it turned out to be .5 per
cent. From this, it can be
inferred that at the end the
Wallace vote returned to
the Democratic Party. Under the Ohio
law, it was difficult to vote for Wal-
lace, since his name was not on the
ticket and voters were faced by the
task of voting for his 25 independent
electors.

BUT there were deeper currents in
motion. The polls, as well as the
election, showed that the farmers in
those eighteen typical counties were
much more favorably disposed toward
Mr. Truman than they were toward
Roosevelt in 1944. In that year, they
were angry at Roosevelt because they
felt that with controls and the like
they were not getting their fair cut in
war prosperity. Thus, the ironical fact
emerges that the lifting of price con-
trols, which the President so roundly
denounced in his speeches, probably
provided the votes which elected him.
This is sour fare for the Republicans
who helped to lift those controls.
This year, prices started to decline.
Farmers grew frightened. Dewey
failed to convince them that he fa-
vored supports. Mr. Truman did. And
in the Midwest outside the cities, the
President did not stress controls.
Moreover, several rural Ohio coun-
ties were traditionally Democratic be-
fore Roosevelt. In 1938, with Bricker
running for governor, they went Re-
publican. The present picture shows
that they have gone back to their
tradition, while in the big cities the
population, and along with it the
Democratic vote, has grown larger.

The vote in Ohio was lighter this
year. In 1940 all Presidential candi-
dates received 3,320,579. In 1944 the
figure was 3,153,056. This year it was
approximately 2,940,000. The identity
of the missing Ohio voters cannot be
determined at this writing.
A big factor in Ohio was the im-
mense drawing power of Frank
Lausche, running for his former job
as governor. He won by
more than 200,000 over
Governor Herbert who, to
say the least, is far from a
Bricker in popularity. The
Republican organization,
overconfident that Dewey
would win, tried to save
Herbert at the expense of
Dewey.
It may well be that most
of these factors applied in
several other Midwestern states, such
as Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and
Iowa. In Indiana, a good former
governor, Schricker, was running
against a little-known candidate. In
Iowa, the outstanding former Senator
Gillette was running against a man
who was no great shakes as a senator.
There may be many other reasons
for the upset, but these bits gleaned
from the soil of a politically famous
state-ironically always called the
"Mother of Republican Presidents"-
may provide a guide to that bewil-
dered group which thought itself a
majority one day and found itself a
minority a few hours later. Prosper-
ous farmers, overconfident Republi-
cans, labor concentration on Congres-
sional candidates, better candidates
on state tickets, and a light vote were
too much even for as good a ticket
as Dewey and Warren.

IN conclusion, I wish to say this to
those who occasionally read what is
in this space, many of whom, like this
writer, believed Dewey would win. I
shall not regale you with advice about
bowing to an all-wise electorate. We
bow to the strength, not the wisdom,
of a decision at the polls. If we grant
that the public is innately wise, we
would in our business of writing be
gilding the lily by offering it our own
ideas and information. We want the
public to be more wise and informed
and will continue to struggle toward
that objective.
