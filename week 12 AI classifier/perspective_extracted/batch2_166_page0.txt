**You Win in the Precincts**

by Raymond Moley

IN MY years as a college teacher of what is called "political science" I attempted to get away from theory and history and help students learn some of the realities of everyday politics. I decided to have practical and successful politicians talk to my classes. But I discovered that while these were excellent practitioners and engaging speakers, they were unable to describe systematically how they did their job. Now and then there were bits of precious insight in what they said, but it was impossible to put these bits together in anything like a formula or text.

Thus there was need for a real educational breakthrough in an art which is as old as civilization and vitally important to millions. There was no way to provide schooling and training for practical political workers. Political workers continued, as they had for generations, to learn by trial and costly error. Perceptive people have realized for a long time that lavish publicity and speeches of candidates, even with the help of mass meetings, radio, and television, are not only of questionable value but exceedingly wasteful. Voters are moved by persons who are close to them in their homes, offices, workshops, clubs, and saloons. Somebody must sell by personal contact.

**LABOR'S 'HOW TO WIN'**

A few years ago there was an educational breakthrough unnoticed by the formal world of education. Organized labor got into politics, and in 1945 the CIO Political Action Committee wrote and published a small book called "How to Win." After the labor merger, the AFL-CIO COPE continued to publish this amazing text in various editions. Innumerable candidates who have been elected or defeated by labor can testify to the book's effectiveness. For it brought an ancient art down to the level of American politics.

Labor's "How to Win" stimulated efforts by other organizations to train volunteers in practical politics. The United States Chamber of Commerce produced its well-known "Action Course in Practical Politics," composed of small texts and leaders' manuals. The latest figures show that 250,000 have taken the course in 1,800 communities under the sponsorship of local chambers and companies.

More recently, the Republican Associates in Los Angeles created a remarkable tool for training political workers. This material is specifically designed for Los Angeles County and California generally.

A major purpose of these courses was to change attitudes toward political activity and to provide for thousands of volunteers the know-how to participate in campaigns.

**DO-IT-YOURSELF POLITICS**

This year Biehl P. Clarke's Civic Affairs Associates in Washington published a new text and leaders' manual called the "Precinct Education Program." This is restricted to personal operations at the grass-roots and neighborhood level. It was prepared at the instance of Rep. Bob Wilson's Republican Congressional Committee.

Clarke points out that this material "goes to the heart of political action by supplying a do-it-yourself program to be conducted by groups numbering as few as from four to twelve neighbors. It is equally usable by inexperienced people who need an understanding of what to do and how to do it, and also by experienced precinct workers who train volunteers. It combines formal instruction with on-the-job training. It changes attitudes and communicates knowledge at the same time."

In the past few years many political-science teachers in colleges and some secondary schools have been enlarging their offerings of dry theory with some instruction in practical politics. Materials developed wholly outside the field of formal education would help every college and secondary-school student to become a more useful citizen.

So, too, might those self-satisfied people profit who now talk a great deal about politics but never turn a hand to help make free institutions work. This applies to 99 of every 100 people I know. For unless they do something other than talk, someone else will care for politics. And what "someone else" does will not be to their liking. Politics needs a massive infusion of new blood.
