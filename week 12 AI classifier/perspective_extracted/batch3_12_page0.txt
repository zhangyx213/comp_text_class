**Lawmaking in Dog Days**

by Raymond Moley

TO CLAIM that this resumption of
the final session of the 86th Con-
gress is necessary is a monstrous
fraud. The Senate leadership, delib-
erately or by acquiescence, permitted
a slowdown in May and June. To pass
legislation in the dog days for political
purposes is to put political advantage
above a sacred public responsibility.
For the intention is either to present
strident minority groups with hand-
outs from the Federal revenue or to
force a President with a will and
conscience to be pilloried by his ve-
toes in September and October as a
man callous to the needs of the poor,
the ill, the elderly, and to the neces-
sary public services of the nation. The
dog days, according to Webster, are
a time of "malignant influences." The
phrase is apt.

Let us consider one subject listed
for action in this period—medical care
for the elderly. It may be taken for
granted that the Democratic majority
is intent upon carrying out the terms
of the party platform on this subject:
"We shall provide medical-care bene-
fits for the aged as part of the
time-tested social-security insurance
system. We reject any proposal which
would require such citizens to submit
to the indignity of a means test."

**POINT OF MADNESS**

The Republican platform would
allow for optional purchase of private
insurance and provide Federal assist-
ance grants to the states for those
who need help. It recognizes that to
give to all without regard to need
would be financial insanity. For no one
knows how many would participate in
a free scheme for all. We do know,
however, that to limit assistance to
recipients of social-security benefits
would give to many who do not need
help and omit many who do.

For the Democratic platform to call
social security (OASI) "insurance" is
wrong. "Insurance" was never used
in the original Social Security Act.
It has been judged by the Supreme
Court to be a gratuity, not the pay-
ment of an equity in insurance. Those
who receive payments are getting
benefits paid out of the earnings of
those below retirement age and by
their employers.

The income to the so-called trust
fund is not enough to meet the outgo.
The fund could be headed for bank-
ruptcy, and all that those who will
have paid into it for years can rely
upon is a grant by Congress from gen-
eral revenues or from a big increase
in the present rate of tax. To load
health onto the burden—that is to
make OASI into OASHI—would, ac-
cording to William R. Williamson,
who used to be chief consulting actu-
ary for the system, carry "fiscal
irresponsibility to the point of mad-
ness." It is a conservative estimate
that OASI plus health "insurance"
would shortly cost 20 per cent of the
first $4,800 of payroll.

**LEGISLATING IN DARK**

The enormous increase in tax on
employers would obviously be passed
on to consumers in inflationary prices
and would be a powerful force in
pricing the United States still further
out of the world market.

To enact the Forand bill in any
modified form would be legislating in
the dark. I have read laboriously hun-
dreds of pages of hearings and other
literature on the subject and I cannot
find that anyone, in either Congress or
the Administration, knows how many
people would need such help or has
any idea of what it would cost.

It is further evident that no one in
the government has fully explored
how much of the problem could be
solved by practical application of tax
deductions. For example, a deduction
for children or other relatives of aged
persons so that private insurance could
be bought. There is a moral issue
here. Would or would not John F.
Kennedy help Father Joe if he went
broke and got sick? Or would he dis-
regard the moral strictures of religion
and pass old, sick Joe over to a vague
thing called society?

Further exploration should be
made of tax adjustments for corpora-
tions which would provide health-
insurance payments for their retired
employes. Another possibility would
be whatever assistance is necessary to
help private insurance to cover eld-
erly people as well as younger ones.
The whole subject should be stud-
ied further, and any legislation should
be considered next year in a calmer
and more rational climate.
