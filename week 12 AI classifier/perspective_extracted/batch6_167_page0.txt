More Overlapping

by Raymond Moley

DURING the past few weeks I have
attempted in this space to draw
attention to a number of legislative
proposals which, in the midst of the
Donnybrook over who’s-the-biggest-
liar-in-Washington, may well be
rushed through under the pressure
of special interests of the Federal
bureaucracy and of members of Con-
gress with an eye on elections.
Such unwatched pieces of
legislation may in the long
run be vastly more important
than the issues involved in the
big fight.
The one to which I call
attention this week is embodied
in two identical bills, H.R. 6788
and S. 2549, introduced by
Messrs. Hope and Aiken respec-
tively.
This proposal is in the interest
of “soil conservation and other
purposes” and would put the
Department of Agriculture sub-
stantially in the business of
building dams of various sizes in
the upper ranges of river basins.
Thus there would be launched, in a
field already occupied by the Army
Corps of Engineers and the Bureau
of Reclamation, a third highly
competitive agency. In the past,
competition between the former
two has been deplorable. Both
have powerful connections with
regional interests such as cham-
bers of commerce, farm groups,
and the like.
Both are adept at creating pres-
sure on Congress from back home.
It should be said on the side of
the Department of Agriculture
that its soil-conservation activi-
ties have in the main been con-
structive and, by comparison
with other aids to farmers, rela-
tively economical. Under existing
law and Congressional appro-
priations, the department has
been conducting soil-conserva-
tion and flood-prevention oper-
ations, including the building of
dams running in size all the way
from those necessary for ordi-
nary farm ponds to fairly large
ones from 50 to 70 feet in height.
The point made by those oppos-
ing an extension of this work is
that dams as large as the latter
will, in the great numbers now
planned by the department, require
a very large engineering and con-
struction agency rivaling those of
the Engineers and the Reclama-
tion Bureau. Also, since flood con-
trol is one of the purposes of this
construction, the Agriculture
Department is put into sharp com-
petition with the Army Engi-
neers. Therefore the Engineers
moved to the attack before the
Senate committee, armed with a
long letter from Secretary Stevens
and a lengthy statement by the
chief of the Engineers. Since the
Engineers Corps is a party of
interest, I shall not adopt their
arguments here, but rather those
of independent engineers of high
standing.
Those engineers say that this
plan would create another very
large competing agency in a field
already crowded; that it would
federalize the building of projects
which should be undertaken by
local interests; that it would make
unnecessary Congressional authori-
zation for projects of large magni-
tude; that it seriously confuses the
purposes of soil conservation and
flood control and thus makes it
impossible to determine benefits
and the allocation of costs; and
that it would jeopardize the Fed-
eral investment by turning the
operation of these works over to
local interests. Finally, it would
create an enormous pork barrel
which, under a politically minded
Secretary of Agriculture, would
have incalculable political potency.
The Hope bill, however, has
passed the House, and the Aiken
bill is now before the Senate com-
mittee. Meanwhile, no doubt
moved by the great protest against
the Upper Colorado storage project
and the Army Engineers’ cam-
paign against the measure de-
scribed above, the President, ap-
propriately expressing “a horror of
piecemeal legislation,” has created a
Cabinet Committee on Water Re-
sources Policy, composed of the
Secretaries of Interior, Defense, and
Agriculture. Wisely he has re-
minded this committee to cooperate
with the Hoover commission, which
is reviewing the whole problem
under distinguished and competent
leadership.

IT WOULD be the part of wisdom
for Congress to await the report of
that committee and the Hoover
report before enacting any of the
large innovations in water con-
servation, soil conservation, or
reclamation.
