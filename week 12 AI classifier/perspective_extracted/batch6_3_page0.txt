**The Leader Above All**

**by Raymond Moley**

REX TUGWELL, when Under Secretary of Agriculture, said that his boss, Henry Wallace, was a mystic. This judgment was well authenticated by the Wallace affinity for strange deities, spooks, and quacks. But a reading of the culmination of Tugwell’s life’s labors—a massive book, “The Democratic Roosevelt”—raises the question whether the mystic mote in the Wallace eye was not dwarfed by the beam in Tugwell’s. For while Mr. Roosevelt, according to the account, failed sometimes to follow Tugwell’s ideal of “collectivism,” Tugwell never wavered in his mystical devotion—devotion to a man rather than to a nation or an idea.

This book is the self-revelation of a man whose turbulent emotions were nourished by a number of malevolent prejudices. According to Tugwell, the United States was, when he met Mr. Roosevelt, infested with “enemies,” which he specifies as “the power companies,” “the money and banking interests,” and “the Supreme Court.” This story, therefore, is a heldenleben. But a saga in which the devils outlived the hero.

For in a lachrymose preface to a book on Puerto Rico, “The Stricken Land,” Tugwell found in 1946 that “the whole of mankind is psychopathic. We had, all of us, been translated to a world and to an era which we felt was too much for us.” He heard and approved President Truman summon former Roosevelt followers to “pursue the Roosevelt line.”

**‘HOLISM’ VS. ‘ATOMISM’**

But his later book shows how difficult it was to follow any definable “Roosevelt line.” He ends by following Mr. Roosevelt wherever he turned.

Even in 1932, Tugwell was unhappy about the conservative tone of Mr. Roosevelt’s speeches, in which, incidentally, he had little part. Only in the Oglethorpe speech was there represented, according to Tugwell, “the high tide of collectivism.”

Later, with President Roosevelt in office, only the TVA and AAA seemed to conform to the “collectivist” ideal. In 1936, Tugwell sadly recounts, the first New Deal died and another, completely contradictory New Deal took its place. The rejected ideology he calls “holism,” a semantic oddity meaning over-all state planning according to the patterns of continental Europe in the 1930s. The new White House idea was the “atomism” of Brandeis, Frankfurter, and Corcoran, whom Tugwell regarded as malign influences. Shortly after the 1936 election the atomists “got” Tugwell, just as four years later Hopkins “got” the atomists. Tugwell concludes that Mr. Roosevelt purged him because he “had been half persuaded—Eleanor even more than he—that I had totalitarian leanings.”

**OF LEADERS AND PRINCES**

Later Mr. Roosevelt, according to this account, scuttled all New Deals, “holism” and “atomism” alike, in saving Europe for democracy. After 1940, Tugwell finds excuses where justifications fail—for failing to anticipate the attack at Pearl Harbor, for unconditional surrender, for the Morgenthau plan (he really suggests that Mr. Roosevelt initialed this dreadful plan “absent-mindedly”), for Teheran, and Yalta.

The Tugwell dedication to Mr. Roosevelt—the “leader complex”—is expressed in a most remarkable, even frightening, passage. Apparently the veil of service, once taken, may never be removed:

“This has nothing to do with any sense of guilt a leader must have about exploiting others. That, he feels, he may do—even must do—with the utmost ruthlessness. All his co-workers are subordinate and are expendable. But that, he assumes, they must expect. It is a hazard they must accept in taking the King’s shilling. The sovereign is not required to explain or to regret the sacrifice of his servants.”

Lest this be interpreted as Machiavellian, I hasten to exculpate the famous Florentine. Machiavelli was more humane, perhaps more enlightened: “To keep his Minister good, the Prince should be considerate of him, dignifying him . . . and sharing with him the honors as well as the burdens of the State.”

Loyalty, even between princes and retainers, is a two-way street.
