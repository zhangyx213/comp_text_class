**Four Steps Toward Free Elections**

by RAYMOND MOLEY

A generation ago, drastic action
was demanded to drive corporate
cattle out of political gardens, and,
in the course of time, a pretty good
job was effected by law. A similar
cleanup is now required in labor
unions, or Presidents and congressmen
may become the helpless prey of politi-
cal coercion.

Several suggestions might be made
to President Truman's pro-
posed six months' commit-
tee, to provide really free
elections and to free all
voters from servitude to
the heads of the economic
groups to which they belong.

1-Drastic measures are
needed to prevent the vast
sums now stored in union
treasuries from being poured
into political campaigns. No
freedom of choice can be
assured to the electorate in the face
of concentrated money offensives in
politics. The ill-tempered boast of
A. F. Whitney about his huge union
treasure and his assertion that $2,500,-
000 is authorized by his board of
directors to wage political warfare
in campaigns. This amount is three
times the annual budget of the Re-
publican National Committee. In a
recent Presidential year, only $15,000
was assigned by the Democratic Na-
tional Committee for the House
campaign committee. A high-ranking
member of the House once told me
that a contribution of $200 would be
considered "manna from Heaven" by
the average House member. Most con-
gressmen are men of modest means.
What chance have they, if great labor
monopolies are scattering millions over
the nation?

2-The political restrictions now im-
posed upon union members by their
officers, by their conventions, and in
their union constitutions should be
removed. A citizen who holds a union
card is still entitled to the secret Aus-
tralian ballot, but in almost every
other respect his potential as a citizen
is severely limited. A good illustration
of this was provided by Mr. Whitney
himself in a case which recently passed
through the courts of Ohio. The presi-
dent of one of the locals of the B.R.T.,
Earl E. Pfoh, participated in an inter-
union fight in 1939 and, as a result,
was removed from his office by Mr.
Whitney's board of directors. Later,
in the 1940 Presidential campaign,


Mr. Pfoh permitted his name to be
used in a letter endorsing Willkie.
On the very dubious and technical
ground that Mr. Pfoh in this letter
was characterized as a "past" presi-
dent of a local, Mr. Whitney and his
board, under the constitution of the
union, fired Mr. Pfoh from the union.
The discipline in this case cut off Mr.
Pfoh from the vital economic advan-
tage of union membership.
Such power over a man's
political activities permits
the controlling powers in a
union to mobilize great blocs
of votes in support of or
against political candidates.
It is as serious a denial of
individual rights as were the
sinister threats of employers
in the McKinley campaign
to close up shop if Bryan
was elected.

3-Provisions in law which substi-
tute government for one of the parties
in collective bargaining should be re-
pealed. This is the essential evil of
the Smith-Connally Act. It compels
the government to compromise the
strike with money and privileges which
do not belong to the government. It
ties up wages with all the monetary,
taxation and price policies currently
pursued by the government. It prac-
tically imposes a regimented economy
upon all enterprise.

4-There can be no political free-
dom when the law permits strikes
against the whole people or the gov-
ernment. A clear distinction must be
made between strikes which cause
inconvenience or localized distress and
those which clearly threaten the gen-
eral welfare, health and safety. A
method should be sought to bring
about some form of compulsory arbi-
tration in issues involving primary util-
ities such as railroads and the produc-
tion of such necessities as coal and
food. No one wants compulsory arbi-
tration. But it may be the only way
to prevent disaster.

More than four centuries ago,
Cesare Borgia is said to have made
this remark to Machiavelli: "Men will
always forgive the loss of their politi-
cal liberty if their private liberty is
left undisturbed." The extent to which
union members have turned over their
political freedom to their leaders, in
return for economic gains, shows that
Borgia's cynical view has some valid-
ity today.
