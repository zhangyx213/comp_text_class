**TAX HELP FOR PARENTS**

**BY RAYMOND MOLEY**

The immense bundle of gifts, loans and other helps which is the Johnson aid-to-education plan is understood by few except some members of Congress, the Administration and professional educators. But everyone knows that it will cost a lot of money and that this money must be raised by taxation or inflation. The government giveth, and the government taketh away.

But the legislation leaves untouched the plight of parents in the lower-middle income range who, in the exercise of freedom of choice, want their children to get a college education. It also does not help the private colleges that are having a hard time keeping alive in the face of rising costs and competition from state-supported institutions.

Help for parents is analyzed, along with a general review of the problems of higher education, in a new book, "Crisis in College Finance?" by Roger A. Freeman of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University (243 pages. Institute for Social Science Research, Washington, D.C. $5).

**INCOME-TAX CREDITS**

Many plans for tax credits or deductions have been before Congress in the past few years. The authors of these have ranged politically and ideologically from Barry Goldwater to Hubert Humphrey. But largely because of the indefatigable labor of Senator Ribicoff since he entered Congress in 1963, a single plan was introduced and voted upon in February 1964. This was called the Ribicoff-Dominick plan and it was co-sponsored by sixteen senators. This year the number of Senate sponsors has risen to 34. It will be an issue again next year.

Because of pressure from the Johnson Administration, several senators who had introduced similar plans and three, including Humphrey, who actually sponsored the Ribicoff-Dominick amendment voted against the measure in 1964. It lost 48 to 45. The amount of relief would depend upon the plan which would be adopted. In any of the versions, it would be less than half the cost of the student's tuition and other expenses. It would still leave the valuable incentive on the part of students and parents to secure an education. But it would help where help is badly needed. And, in general, the students who would thus be able to go to college would be more promising than those who go simply because of loans and gifts. (It is important to note that loaning and giving will be provided in any event because of this year's legislation.)

Tax credits or deductions would, moreover, be a great help to smaller private and denominational colleges which face a struggle for existence. If some such help is not provided, the drift to state-supported institutions will continue, for costs there are lower because of state and Federal subsidies. This will mean that the great number and influence of independent private institutions will diminish at a dangerous rate.

**CONGRESS FAVORABLE**

The tax-credit plan measurably lessens the danger of government control of all education. It leaves freedom of choice in the hands of parents and students, and independence in the colleges themselves.

The major objection of the Treasury is loss of revenue. There are various estimates of this. Generally, however, these estimates are far lower than the cost of many Federal programs which have far less justification than this.

It is clear that a plan for tax relief would induce private colleges to raise tuitions. But even if they do this, the net gain to the parents and students is considerable for the amount of credit could be adjusted to a percentage of the tuition.

The ultimate extension of the Johnson trend would mean free education for all. And this would mean vast hordes of students many of whom would seek the relatively easier life in college rather than the rigors of the world outside. Most of such students would be ill-prepared and unworthy, and the terribly wasteful trend toward dropouts would rise higher and higher.

There is no doubt that if there had been no pressure from the Administration in 1964 and 1965, some plan for help to parents would have passed. We must now look to 1966 for this needed reform.
