**Dewey's Views on the Issues**

by RAYMOND MOLEY

From time to time this column has reported that Republican politicians in various states have manifested impatience about Governor Dewey's silence on public issues. Their disappointment relates to the fact that he did not endorse or commend the 1947 record of his party in Congress. As the Republican choice for the Presidency in 1944, Dewey is by tradition the titular leader of his party and, thus, is expected by party regulars to speak for and of the party's policies and achievements.

I can set down with the certainty of personal knowledge that Dewey's silence is no indication of disapproval of the major policies supported by his party in Congress. He favors the important principles and provisions of the Taft-Hartley Act. He favored the tax-reduction bill passed by Congress and vetoed by the President. He feels that the Republican party in Congress was wise in supporting the unification of the services in a Department of Defense.

Dewey feels that his record in the formulation of labor legislation and administrative policies in New York ought to be clear evidence of approval of the Taft-Hartley Act. Much of what the Taft-Hartley law enacted on a national scale has been put on the statute books of New York since Dewey has been leader of the Republican party in the state. This record, he believes, speaks for itself. Senator Ives, whom Dewey designated as his running mate in 1946, voted for the Taft-Hartley bill, and Dewey is outspoken in praise of the conduct of New York's new senator. Moreover, Congressional leaders can testify that the quiet support of the New York governor was provided in mustering the votes necessary to pass the Taft-Hartley bill. Those leaders can also testify that Dewey encouraged the formulation of the tax-reduction program which the President destroyed by his veto.

With reference to foreign affairs, Dewey feels that the record again speaks. John Foster Dulles, Dewey's selection as his representative in 1944, has remained to this date as a major Republican adviser to Congress and the Administration in foreign relations.

Dewey fully agrees with the positions taken by Dulles in his contacts with the Administration and with Congress. It should be noted that Dewey, in speaking before the American Legion in August, made a plea for further cooperation on foreign affairs on the part of the Administration. He complained that "in many important matters there has been virtually no consultation, and bipartisanship has been ignored." He pointed up very sharply that the Administration should permit full participation "in advance" by members of Congress.

Dewey's reluctance to discuss national issues in public speeches rises largely from his knowledge that the Republican majority in Congress has a special and difficult responsibility. If, in anticipation of some future action, he were publicly to announce his views, he would put his fellow Republicans on a spot. They would feel that, since they are not only responsible legislators but are closer to the situation, there should be no lecturing to them through appeals to their constituents. Dewey's influence as a party leader, he feels, can best be exerted by personal contacts.

Regarding the past actions of his party, the situation is different. Dewey recognizes that he might, with propriety, have commended his party at the conclusion of the session. That he did not do so was not because of disagreement. The positions outlined above should make clear that he warmly supports his party and strives for party unity in the face of the great campaign of 1948.

There is a personal factor which deserves consideration. Although Dewey is a young man, still he feels that he has been before the nation a long time. Reiteration of his views—spread in the record over a longer period than those of any other possible candidates—would, he believes, be playing over old transcriptions.

No one can see Dewey at work without noting that he is perfectly happy as governor. He will not solicit the nomination. What happens in 1948 is in the hands of Republican voters, Republican leaders and delegates—and in the inscrutable volution of Providence.
