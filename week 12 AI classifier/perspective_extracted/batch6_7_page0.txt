**Fruits of Confidence**

**by Raymond Moley**

SANTA BARBARA, CALIF.—A very wise Republican said recently that while Dwight D. Eisenhower is an expensive President, he has given us an Administration of real integrity. That, he added, is worth a lot. Another great value contributed by this Administration is a high degree of business confidence, which means abundant buying and investment. This is brilliantly illustrated in the fruits of the Eisenhower partnership power policy in the Northwest.

The partnership policy is not new. The entire concept behind the Hoover Dam was that of a partnership between the Federal government, which built and operates the enormous dam, and private and public bodies, which assured sound financing through firm contracts to buy power. The Eisenhower policy is based upon the simple facts that the Federal government should keep out of competition with private business, and that it cannot justify spending great sums of taxpayers’ money when there is a chance to attract private investors’ capital to do the job.

This encouragement to private investors has been rewarded by the construction of many private projects throughout the Northwest. There are now under construction or under license thirteen private power projects, four by public-utility districts (PUD), three by the municipalities of Seattle and Tacoma. There are also seven Federal projects under construction.

**PRACTICAL RESULT**

The estimated production from the private projects will be 1,870,600 kilowatts; from the public-utility districts, 1,900,800; from the Federal dams, 1,869,000; from the municipals, 517,000. The split among the private companies, the public-utility districts, and the Federal government is almost even.

But this is not the whole story. For the production from some of the PUD’s has already in considerable part been contracted for by private companies. In fact, the PUD’s could hardly get the investment essential to such large projects without these contracts. Incidentally, these PUD’s share none of the fanaticism of the Federal power people. As they get into the practical job of production, they develop practical ideas.

The proof is ample here that if the Federal government will permit it, there are plenty of private and public local agencies able to do the job in all except the very large dams already under way.

But despite this construction, much more power will be needed in the years immediately ahead. One of the projects urgently needed is the John Day Dam on the Columbia River, already authorized by Congress. Two proposals were made for the construction of the power aspects of the project—one by the private companies, another by a PUD. There would have been repayment in power from the dams after completion. Senator Morse and others have consistently blocked this project. Their attitude toward this and other projects is all-Federal-or-nothing. Like the British Socialists, they are for fair shares of scarcity.


**NEXT** week in this space, the distinguished authority on government finance, Sen. Harry F. Byrd of Virginia, will begin a discussion of four important questions I have asked him:

1—What has been the result of this year’s grass-roots mandate for expenditure reduction?

2—Will it be necessary to raise the statutory Federal debt limit again this year?

3—Is tax reduction likely in the next session of Congress?

4—Has Congress lost control over Federal expenditures; and if so, how can it be recaptured?

No man in Washington is better equipped to come to grips with matters such as these; matters which could mean thinner, thicker—or even emptier—purses for many of us in the times just ahead. Senator Byrd, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and the Joint Congressional Committee which has been fighting the long, hard battle for economy in the Federal government, is head of the committee now engaged in an intensive and wholesome inquiry into the great problem of taxes. It is, of course, a great pleasure to yield PERSPECTIVE’S space to Senator Byrd for his discussion.
