**Men Bred to Leadership**

by Raymond Moley

THIS campaign will be decided by voters who are not talking. Some regard their preferences as none of their neighbors' business. Others are confused—and no wonder. To most, "economic growth" figures, unemployment, housing, old-age medical care, schools, who said what and where and when are blurred images in wearied minds.

What will stand out on the decisive day will be four men, candidates for leadership in perilous times. Not issues, nor promises, nor parties. We shall reach for the quality of the men, their maturity, their proved capacity for hard labor, their self-restraint, their spiritual fiber, their training and experience.

The incredible, almost frightening responsibility which will rest on the next President should be apparent. A President must direct and control a mammoth bureaucracy. He must command the greatest military power ever seen on earth. He must execute laws that affect our lives from conception to dissolution and participate in making new laws. His decisions in foreign affairs will affect every human being on earth.

Moreover, he will exercise immense moral influence over all Americans. His will be the national voice. He will be the focus of all eyes, for all voters will have participated in his election. He can set the character of national ideals, even fashions of conduct, taste, and dress.

**THE GREAT TRADITION**

A man profoundly perceptive in public affairs, Woodrow Wilson, in 1908, told what Americans expect of a President:  "A man who will be and who will seem to the country . . . an embodiment of the character and purpose they wish their government to have."

That was said before Nixon and Kennedy were born, when Lodge was 6, and Johnson was a babe in arms. In the same address, Wilson listed the Virginia dynasty—Washington, Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe—as "men bred to leadership." Wilson might easily have added John and John Quincy Adams.

Those six men served as President from 1789 to 1825. Consider their training in dealing with the world and making a nation. Washington dominated the nation for twenty years wisely. The Presidency was made a powerful office because the framers of the Constitution trusted his self-restraint. Jefferson had been Minister to France. John Adams had represented our interests in France and England. Madison was long trained in responsible public life and was the greatest of all framers of the Constitution. Monroe had been Minister to France, negotiated the Louisiana Purchase, and was Minister to England. John Quincy Adams had been Minister to Russia and to England. Two of these had been Vice President, and four had been Secretary of State.

**ABOVE LITTLE WELFARES**

These six men dealt with the world's greatest imperial powers; they appeased no one and conceded nothing. Under their Presidencies they saw to it that a fringe of states along the Atlantic stretched into the reaches of a great nation. Boldly and without taking a Gallup poll of prestige, they successfully checked European imperialism in the American continents. In those years, the times chose the Presidents. And the Presidents made the Presidency.

Foreign affairs dominated the scene until 1825. Later Presidents were chosen on domestic issues. And now in these years, as it was a century and a half ago, foreign affairs become paramount. We are struggling against imperial powers more alien, more deadly, more threatening than ever before.

Are Americans to choose between candidates because one offers a benefit for the little group at the expense of all Americans? What can many little welfares be worth if national welfare is lost in a world struggle? I do not believe that Americans will choose a candidate for President who behaves as if he were running for the Senate or House of Representatives.

No. The choice should go to those who have been closest to the threat and have participated in the struggle against that threat. Men who know Communism for what it is, what it plans, and the means by which Communists further their sinister purposes.
