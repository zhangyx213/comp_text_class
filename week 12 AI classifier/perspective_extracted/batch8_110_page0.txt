**The Troubles of Reform**

A Governor Edison delivers several resounding raps on the noggin of Boss Hague and Mayor La Guardia rushes into action vowing to beat Tammany Hall for the third time, we may expect confirmed optimists to predict the end of boss rule and the coming of the millennium of local government. But before the hats go into the air let us look around a bit. Machine rule does not die in a day. A defeat or two or three does not destroy its roots. Machine rule is holding its own in dozens of places, regardless of what goes on in New Jersey and New York City. And, as a matter of fact, its chances look none too poorly even there.

Hague will survive until the voters of Hudson County tire of the kind of government which overwhelming majorities of them have returned to office over and over again. The third election of La Guardia is by no means in the bag. Some of his Republican backers feel that he is more of a New Dealer than Tammany itself. Some of his extreme left-wing labor support is expected to split off. His opponent will be District Attorney William O'Dwyer of Brooklyn—an able, clean and popular figure. The Democrats in New York are never beaten until the votes are counted anyway. They are, after all, the dominant party in the city. Moreover Thomas E. Dewey has not yet decided to run for reelection as District Attorney on La Guardia's ticket. If he finally makes up his mind not to, that will also impair La Guardia's election prospects. La Guardia does not share Dewey's views on national affairs; but he wants him on the ticket.

In many places in this country reform is definitely in trouble. In Missouri the Pendergast influence is still strong even though the Boss himself is out of the way. Only a public aroused by the excellent newspapers of that state prevented the Legislature from barring Forrest C. Donnell, a Republican, from his gubernatorial seat. A pretty awful legislative session has just dragged through 186 days to its uproarious close—a session about which charges are being shouted the length and breadth of the state. Names have been named and documentary evidence produced—evidence presented to a legislative committee that proposed a sweeping investigation. The Legislature itself, despite the public outery, adjourned without voting the investigation. Lamenting this disgraceful record, The Kansas City Times says: "Of course, there must be no repetition of the 1941 Missouri Legislature. This was the worst House of Representatives in Missouri's memory of many dismal sessions . . . Even under present laws and methods, there was never an excuse for the miserable House of Representatives that defied the people of Missouri this year. But this state is entitled to something far better than it has ever had before. If there is any powder of public indignation in this state, the 1941 session should strike the match."

But the most colorful and explosive situations seem to be in the making in Georgia and Louisiana. We have all been reminded recently that Gene Talmadge is back as Governor of Georgia. For fantastic reasons—reasons most assuredly not to their discredit—the dean of the University of Georgia's College of Education, the president of the State Teachers College and the vice-chancellor of the State University system have been ousted from their posts at the behest of the Governor. The Atlanta newspapers that protested were warned by the Governor that because they had opposed his actions he would give them no more news. They need not worry. As long as they have Talmadge they will have news; but not good news. Talmadge will never build up the personal machine that Long did in Louisiana, of course. Conditions are not as propitious in Georgia and besides, so far as ability goes, Talmadge is only a dim carbon copy of Huey. Nevertheless Talmadge represents a political reaction, and a discouraging reaction.

More discouraging still are the obstacles that Governor Sam Jones is meeting in Louisiana. A year ago Jones came into office crowned with victory over the crippled but still dangerous Long machine. Masses of the people of his state greeted him as a savior. Harnett T. Kane, in his marvelous story of the rise and aftermath of Huey Long ("Louisiana Hayride," published by Morrow), tells of their hysterical joy after the Jones election: "On election night, and the next night, and the next, thousands formed processions, joined parades of automobiles, wound in and out of towns and city streets; shook hands, knelt sometimes in prayer, made speeches of derision, of exaltation, of exultation, of bombast, of sobbing happiness. Louisianians who had been silent for twelve years as far as expression of their true thoughts were concerned, tossed handfuls of the sales-tax tokens in the air, carried mops to 'clean up the state,' wore mock high hats to throw back the charge against the victorious candidate . . . danced in the streets, as stores and theaters were closed for events that some towns termed 'the biggest since Armistice Day.' But the man who voiced the meaning of that victory was Sam Jones, as he stood on a balcony above the men and women who had made him Governor.

"We're back in the Union now!"

But reform is more than putting people into jail. It is, after all, a prosaic matter of reorganizing offices, of getting more efficient people, of throwing light into dark corners of administration and of downing that bitter, bitter pill—economy. Jones conscientiously went to work. He got from the legislature a fairly broad reorganization of the state government—a regrouping of some 145 departments to promote more efficient centralized administration. He achieved a reduction in personnel and many other important economies.

For a while, for month after month in fact, it looked as if reform were going swimmingly. And then, suddenly, the attrition of reform began. The State Supreme Court, with its holdover appointees, began to throw out many of the most essential features of the reorganization. In another case coming up this fall, the Court may throw out all the rest. The result is chaos in Louisiana. It will be like unscrambling eggs for the Jones administration to go backward, and to go forward will probably require not only a special legislative session but a Constitutional Convention. At this writing Jones has not decided on his course.

Meanwhile out of his retirement ex-Governor Earl Long is shouting the old Huey Long class appeals. Jones, he says, has taken free ambulances from the people, kept them from getting into Charity Hospital and has not provided $30 a month for the old folks. Jones is also having trouble with the New Orleans organization, which, curiously enough, was the last of Huey Long's conquests and which is the last stronghold of his former followers.

Concern over national and international affairs should not make us forget to watch local governments closely. After all the states and counties and cities are essential to democracy. Whenever we relax our vigilance some Kingfish will arise and, with new forms of bread and circuses, entrench himself in power. When he does and when, at long last, we realize how dangerous he is, there is nothing so hard as to find the way back to orderly and sane government. For the Kingfish will always have the brighter, the more seductive shows. Reform is not very thrilling stuff. Who can dance to the refrain of administrative reorganization and law reform? What song can be sung to the tune of economy? Liberty can be lost in most alluring ways. To recover it is something else again.
