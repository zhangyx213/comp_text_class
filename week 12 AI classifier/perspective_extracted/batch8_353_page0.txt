**TODAY IN AMERICA**
May 8, 1937
BY RAYMOND MOLEY

**MONOPOLY AGAIN**

THE administration seems to be anxious to take the
public's mind off two or three issues which have
soured. That, it seems to me, can be the only ex-
planation for the repetition of gestures toward some
sort of industrial regulation at this particular time.
But these gestures point in contradictory directions.
First, stories that the NRA is to be revived in modified
form reflect the views of one group of Presidential
advisers who favor the frank acceptance of the prin-
ciple of bigness in business. Then, a week later, an-
other school seems to have the Presidential ear: we
see sudden, hostile gestures toward bigness in business
and hear quaint, old-fashioned talk of tightening up
the Sherman Act.

The particular incident which has aroused govern-
mental wrath against industrial bigness seems to be
the identical bids on the steel for the navy. The steel
situation does not embrace the whole question of big-
ness in business, but it involves enough phases of the
problem to make it worth a moment's examination.
Steel prices have to be known well in advance. The
automobile manufacturer must know ahead of time
what steel is going to cost him. The bidder on a
bridge certainly has to know. The price of steel can-
not fluctuate daily like the price of cotton or wheat
without seriously upsetting the steel-consuming in-
dustries. Hence the practice in the steel industry is
to announce prices good for the quarter year.

But the fact that identical prices are announced
does not mean that there is no competition among
companies. In the first place, their prices are not an-
nounced simultaneously. There is considerable jockey-
ing for position. If Corporation C develops a new
process which cuts costs, it announces a lower price
per ton on the specified product. When this is known,
competitors must meet it, and do. Who will pay
Corporation A or B more for the same steel C sells
cheaper?

Take thin-rolled sheets. The first Company to de-
velop the continuous mill brought down the price.
Competitors had to meet the cut, even when it meant
a loss to them with their less efficient equipment. Of
course, they hurried to build new mills too. Prices
kept dropping. Within ten years, the price of sheets
has been cut in half. That isn't all. The sheets that
cost half as much are twice as good. New widths have
revolutionized the methods of making automobile
bodies, and finish has been improved so much that
automobile makers nowadays merely spray a coat of
lacquer on the surface without further polishing.

As a matter of fact, competition in the steel busi-
ness was never keener than it is today, and nobody
knows it better than the big buyers who take advan-
tage of the fact. But suppose it were not. The im-
portant question is not whether prices are uniform,
but whether they are too high. The object of our
economic system is to produce the greatest possible
amount of goods and achieve their widest possible dis-
tribution. Excessive prices are bad not so much be-
cause they divert the broad stream of consumer in-
come into a few pockets, but principally because they
reduce the supply of goods which consumers may
acquire and enjoy.

Here enters a new factor of which our political

leaders seem unaware. The grimmest competition to-
day, with technical progress at its present stage of de-
velopment, is not between Steel Corporation A and
Steel Corporation B, but between steel and substitutes.
Between stainless steel and aluminum, for instance.
Between steel and lumber in buildings. Between steel
and concrete for bridges, lampposts, culverts, fence-
posts, floors, roofs and scores of other applications.
Copper competes with aluminum and plastics and
steel. If copper gutters get too expensive, we use gal-
vanized iron. And vice versa. If a monopoly or near
monopoly pushes the price of lacquers too high, paints
and varnishes surge back into popularity. That is
why competitors in an industry, as coal, cotton textiles,
lumber and others, join in cooperative advertising and
research campaigns against a common enemy.

The government's move against the Aluminum Co.
of America brings out this fact vividly. It is ques-
tionable whether the company can possibly be broken
up into several units. But even if it could, that kind
of roundabout move is not necessarily a means of af-
fecting its prices. As a practical matter, any tendency
on the part of economic monopolies to get prices too
high defeats itself in any event, because the monopo-
lies fail to develop the markets that they might have
had for their products. It merely stimulates research
and the invention of substitutes which enable the con-
sumer to wriggle away from high-cost raw materials.
These are some of the reasons why the Administra-
tion's latest "trust-busting" war cry sounds old-fash-
ioned. It is a hangover from the days of 30 years ago.
"Monopoly" was a legitimate issue then, and America
was stirred by it. The profound public indifference
about it today seems to me to prove that there is no
sense of oppression among consumers, great or small.
A new force for regulation of prices has come into
operation which is more powerful than any Federal
statute. Undoubtedly, we still need to police industry
to prevent various abuses. But it is not the job it
once was. Throughout a wide area, price extortion has
been made impossible by a competition between whole
industries which is more merciless than anything we
were able to foster by law within single industries.

**HIS MAJESTY'S LOYAL OPPOSITION**

IN England they call the party out of power His
Majesty's Loyal Opposition. Democratic strategists
here only go so far as to say that the Republican party
is an asset in the sense that whatever it does gains
votesâ€”for the Democrats. But no doubt it will occur
to some Democratic wit to designate the Republican
party as H.M.L.O. if Mr. Hamilton isn't awfully care-
ful in the next few months.

Mr. Hamilton plans to make a series of radio
speeches. It is reported that he is going to touch on
the Court issue only incidentally. Whether or not
his remarks are incidental is unimportant. What is
important is that Mr. Hamilton must not try to make
a party issue of the President's Court proposal. If
he does, he will only enable the President to charge
opposing Democrats with making common cause with
the Republicans. He will only drive many wavering
Democratic Senators into reluctant support of the plan.
