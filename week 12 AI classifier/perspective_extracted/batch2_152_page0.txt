**Aid to the Undeserving**

**by Raymond Moley**

IN "PYGMALION," Shaw makes this
little, pregnant observation through Doo-
little, the dustman:

"I'm one of the undeserving poor
... I don't need less than a deserving
man: I need more. I don't eat less
hearty than him; and I drink a lot
more. I want a bit of amusement,
cause I'm a thinking man ... I'm un-
deserving; and I mean to go on being
undeserving; I like it ... Undeserving
poverty is my line ... It's the only one
that has any ginger in it."

Doolittle feeds on the compassion
of "middle-class morality" and he de-
spises the hand that helps him. Later
he is projected into the middle class.
Its morality distresses him. There is
no "ginger" in it.

As we contemplate the world around
us, we are struck by the extent to
which human beings are concerned
with help to the undeserving.

In India, Nehru, instead of shoring
up his resources against the predatory
Chinese, prostrated himself before the
Kremlin. When the free world needed
him, he buried himself in the illusion
of neutrality. He hired out 5,000 of his
best fighting men to the U.N. to crush
Tshombe, who was fighting for the
same thing that Nehru now craves.
One hundred thousand of his troops
are standing as a threat to Pakistan.
His creature, Menon, was kept as a
means of abusing the free world while
Nehru prated of peace and appease-
ment at home. And we know that
Menon was a paper tiger.

**LUXURIOUS NEUTRALITY**

Now the United States must fly to
the aid of India. Nehru has failed to
realize that the only reason he has
been able to enjoy the luxury of neu-
trality is that the United States has
the power to resist Communism. A dis-
illusioned Lord Attlee, whose Socialist
government gave India its inde-
pendence, said recently: "Nehru ...
has for a long time tended to hide his
head in the sand. He ought to realize
that there is no such thing as neutrality
in the world."

All over the world this pattern is re-
vealed. Ben Bella's rise to his present
prominence was abetted by American
sentimentalists. Those people, by
what they said, impaired our friend-
ship with France. We are repaid by

Ben Bella's embracing our enemies.
Much of our aid to recipient nations
never reaches the people for whom
it is intended. It sticks to the hands
of their exploiters.

On the domestic scene aid to the
undeserving becomes a way of life.
American farmers in the first world
war overextended their production
and neglected rational cooperative
means of putting their industry on a
sound basis. Ever since, they have
been supported by the generality of
taxpayers. In 1933 bankers came run-
ning to Washington for help. In the
1920s they had imperiled their sol-
vency by making unsound loans, and
Jesse Jones and his RFC saved them
in spite of themselves. Our relief rolls
are crammed with Doolittles.

**POLITICAL MISCHIEF**

A new philosophy has been created
to justify this aid to the undeserving.
It is humane, we believe, to help
those who have failed to help them-
selves. Maybe it is indeed more
blessed to give than to receive. But it
is hard on the provident. Our Federal
welfare legislation suggests what
Santayana once wrote: "Love is very
penetrating, but it penetrates to pos-
sibilities rather than to facts."

There is also a rational element in
our philosophy. If we permit the Doo-
littles to suffer too much they will
constitute an element of disorder and
ugliness in our society. They will re-
volt and endanger all of us. Thus, the
undeserving have a potential power
of coercion. Better, we reason, to
maintain appearances and order by
sapping their energies through the
enjoyment of what they do not earn.

The mischief comes when this phi-
losophy goes a step further and holds
that the undeserving have not only a
claim on our compassion but an in-
herent right to receive. To provide
proof of need, it is held, is degrading.
It is a "pauper's oath."

And therein politics discovers a
means of mobilizing votes. The un-
deserving are organized in powerful
minorities, using our money to pay
the cost of exploiting us. These mi-
norities proliferate by what they feed
upon. Priorities are created for the
undeserving. Government becomes
their instrument.
