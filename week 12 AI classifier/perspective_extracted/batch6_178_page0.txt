**A Hidden Handout**

by Raymond Moley

ON THE very day when senators turned to the George amendment as a means of bringing international agreements affecting the internal economy within the control of Congress, the State Department was arguing passionately for an international tin agreement which, if adopted, would cost Americans, particularly housewives, something like $45 million a year. The place was the Commerce Department; the audience, an advisory committee of businessmen. The strenuous arguments against such an international cartel by two other Federal departments carried the day, and the committee voted in the negative. The proposal is far from dead, however.

This agreement concerns the world’s production, consumption, and surplus of tin. In the sweet name of “stability,” the U.N. conference on tin drafted this document in Geneva last December. It would establish an International Tin Council with headquarters in London. Floor and ceiling prices would be set by it. Production quotas would be fixed. The price would be fixed at 95 cents a pound—10 cents above the present market. A sizable “buffer” stock would be used to make sure that the world price would stay within a range determined by the council. The United States would assume the lion’s share of the burden of sustaining this buffer stock which would, in substance, be a gigantic subsidy. Participating countries would each be assigned a stated number of votes, but the United States could never have more than a minority of something less than one fourth.

In case of a tin shortage, the council might make recommendations to insure the consuming countries the “equitable distribution of available supplies.” Thus, we might find ourselves in the predicament in which we found ourselves in 1951, when we had bargained ourselves out of enough copper to meet our industrial needs—and as a result tens of thousands of workers were unemployed. This apportionment of the world’s supply is the antithesis of a free market. Thus, while the State Department prates about more international trade, it is trying to effectuate a method vastly more restrictive than any tariff.

It should be emphasized that the price of tin is now abnormally high because of stockpiling by some of the Western nations, notably the United States and Britain. The maintenance of such an abnormal price will depend upon the United States being able to absorb virtually all the tin in the world under its contracts with the Belgian Congo and the socialistic industries of Indonesia and Bolivia. With the termination of those contracts, the natural course of the price would be downward. Such a decline would not be ruinous to the producing countries. But such a decline, the State Department, the U.N. internationalists, and, of course, the tin-producing countries are dead set to prevent at the expense of what Bernard Baruch has often called “Uncle Sap.”

The recent International Wheat Agreement has cost the United States $600 million. An international rubber agreement which was in the works last year will be the next project. Even a man untutored in elementary economics must recognize that U.S. commitment to such agreements might well cause a scramble wherever the commodities involved can be dug from the earth, tapped from trees, grown in the ground, or produced synthetically. Even if quotas at the present production level were effective, the U.S. taxpayer would be stuck with a terrific bill.

The claims of political benefits in this proposal are grossly exaggerated. Employment in the tin industry of Indonesia and Malaya is a tiny fraction of their teeming millions. If we yield to the claim that this is the answer to Communism in Southeast Asia, we shall next be subsidizing rubber and everything else produced there.

This is not only a proposal to add an immense but hidden amount to our present aid to those countries, but it has the potentialities of extending our American crop subsidies to the entire world. Such subsidies have no limits and no end. Prodigal subsidies mean prodigious production.
