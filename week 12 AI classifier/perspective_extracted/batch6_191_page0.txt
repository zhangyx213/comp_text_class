Good-by, Mr. Ruark

by Raymond Moley

IT HAS taken a while to get around to
an article in last month's Reader's
Digest, what with the election and
the White case.
Its title is "Good-by, New York!"
and in it Robert C. Ruark gives his
stated reasons why he gave up his
career and his residence in this city
and took a house in Spain.
"It was a good job," he writes,
"$65,000 a year for writing
five short columns a week
about anything that crossed
my thoughts. I had nearly
200 newspapers and my
contract still had five years
to run.
Ruark says that "By all
the hallmarks of the New
Yorker I was a howling suc-
cess." The adjective quite
accurately fits the author's
specifications of the status which he
abandoned: "We lived in a penthouse
and Mama had her mink. Billingsley
sent me free champagne from the
Stork Club. I knew everybody from
Bernie Baruch to Frank Costello."
Ruark is entitled to his inimitably
frank remarks about his personal af-
fairs. What troubles me is his opinion
that his job was "what most news-
papermen would give an arm for."
It was indeed a boulevardier's
dream. I doubt that it was the dream
of "most newspapermen," even of
young prospective newspapermen.
"Nobody I knew," continued Ruark,
"was happy in the city any more. No-
body smiled. Everybody complained
... Every time I went to one of those
damned standarounds as Pa called
cocktail parties, I got madder ... My
day was telephones, appointments,
and invitations I couldn't duck ... I
never seemed to have time to write
until everybody else was in bed."
Ruark warns the youth in places
other than New York of the folly
of those who "make big cities their
mecca. There's a glitter about the
city all right but it is phosphorescence
like that of a dead fish-and there's a
bad smell around."
I have lived in New York for 30
years and beg to suggest to the young
people whom Ruark presumes to ad-
vise that a person's life here is not
what New York decrees it to be. New
York is big and variegated enough to
give a man what he wants and, I may
add, to give him what he deserves.
I know a newspaperman who has
distinction quite equal to that of
Ruark and who, if he cared for them,
could enjoy all the perquisites enu-
merated above. He has lived for many
years within five blocks of the Stork
Club and "21" and has visited those
excellent places perhaps not more
than once or twice a year. He gets
only the calls he wants be-
cause his telephone is un-
listed. He isn't bothered
about unwelcome invita-
tions because after a few
refusals the sort of bids he
doesn't like don't come any
more. He sees about any-
one he wants to see under
conditions of his choosing.
He doesn't have to write
after everybody else has
gone to bed; he gets up early and
works in the mellow atmosphere of
the morning. He doesn't believe in the
late Richard Carle's line: "Early to
bed and early to rise, and you don't
meet any prominent people." Early
one morning he met Herbert Hoover
on Madison Avenue. There are plenty
of other interesting people abroad
then. A few mornings ago he might
have seen Harry S. Truman holding a
press conference at 7 on Park Avenue.
Baruch, whom he also knows, doesn't
mind early calls. My friend doesn't
know Frank Costello, but he knew
Jimmy Walker.
Occasionally he goes to the Dutch
Treat Club and sees successful and
famous newspapermen who wouldn't
be caught dead at the cocktail parties
that Ruark couldn't seem to duck.
They don't feel that they have to
go. And they have done pretty well
without them.
My friend sees a lot of New Yorkers
who are happy. They like the way
they live. There may be bad smells
in New York, but there are bad smells
in Spain, too.

Ruark says that in Spain he is
happy because he is "fettered
by no chains not of my own making."
Perhaps he never realized that the
chains that bound him in New York
were his own.
New York is, I repeat, able to give
you what you want and deserve. And
so's most every other place.
