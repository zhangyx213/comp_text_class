**Ike Learns His Trade**
by Raymond Moley

WHEN Dwight Eisenhower was selected as president of Columbia University, there was a lifting of eyebrows in some educational circles. It was said that he hardly had the qualifications to direct an educational institution, since he had spent his life in Army camps. In reply, it was pointed out that in the twenty years after his graduation from West Point he had displayed a passionate interest in educating himself by taking almost every course offered by the Army for the higher training of officers. It was aptly suggested that a man who could educate himself might well have the capacity to educate others. This quality also indicated the capacity to learn and to learn with remarkable facility. The capacity to learn has certainly been evident in President Eisenhower's conduct as a party leader. What he has learned has come the hard way since that day, a little more than two years ago, when he made his fantastic debut as a politician in Abilene. The way was hard because the advisers by whom he was surrounded were either rank amateurs, so-called liberal Republicans, or Democrats. The seasoned Republicans were mostly in the Taft camp. But Mr. Eisenhower has achieved the remarkable result of learning the art of politics despite the fact that he has not cast off those early associations. Into his ear the Democrats have poured the advice to repudiate a large part of his own party, which would end in his frustration and defeat. The liberal Republicans have told him to make his policies so much like those of Truman and Roosevelt that voters could not distinguish him from his opponents. And the amateurs, with the ineffable presumption to call themselves independents, have told him to rise above party entirely.

There have been moments when it seemed to durable and loyal Republicans that those Job’s comforters were comfortably in the saddle. For inexperience or impulse often marked Mr. Eisenhower’s speech and actions. But somehow he is winning his status as a Republican and party leader.

Among the many things the President has learned are these: Members of a great political party do not have to agree on everything. An American party is an instrument for the conduct of government, not a sect or a secret society. True, for many reasons the Republican Party recognizes itself as the sponsor of free enterprise and local responsibility. This ideological pattern was literally thrust upon it by the affinity of the Roosevelt and Truman Administrations for more state intervention and more Federal power. This general image of Republican policy the President finds congenial. For he has seen at first hand the weakness of personal government and the waste and abuses of centralized authority. Within that broad pattern there is room for many variations. A party leader need not have a personal liking for everybody in his camp. Here again, there is room for plenty of variety. But a leader should not alienate his associates. Mr. Eisenhower, with a broad strain of tolerance in his nature, can fulfill this requirement with no great effort. There is now evidence that he has grasped the fact that the group of liberals who control the Democratic Party are intent on getting back into the seats of the mighty and the pastures of patronage. They are not interested in Mr. Eisenhower’s success. They are interested in his failure. The aim of a party is to get power and to destroy the power of the opposition. And nothing delights liberal Democrats so much as to portray the Republican Party as a house divided.

A PARTY must have leadership which can accommodate itself to differences, conciliate when it can, but minimize when it cannot, and, above all, search out and articulate a set of policies upon which reasonable agreement can be reached. In short, to use the immortal phrase of the late Will Hays, assimilate, not eliminate. As the lines form for the campaign, Republicans may be assured that they have a President who is not a fumbling amateur, but a man who in two short years has learned a lot of the facts of political life.
