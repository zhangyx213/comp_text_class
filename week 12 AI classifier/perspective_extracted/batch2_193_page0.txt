**PERSPECTIVE**

**School Aid in New Dress**

by Raymond Moley

THERE is now pending in the House
Rules Committee a bill (H.R. 132)
to make channels available and to
provide Federal subsidies for educational television. This legislation
passed the Senate last year almost
without notice and with little or no
comment. But while the Federal
money involved is relatively small, as
the bill becomes better-known it
promises the same controversial issues
which ended in the defeat of President Kennedy's omnibus Federal aid-for-schools proposal last September.
The radio-TV spectrum is a relatively scarce and strictly limited natural resource controlled by the
Federal Communications Commission.
The FCC has reserved 268 channels
for educational purposes. Only 54 are
in use at the present time. The argument is that state and local public agencies must have subsidies from the
Federal government to avail themselves of these channels because it is costly to provide the technical and other facilities to use them effectively.
The bill would authorize total appropriations of $25,520,000 to be used in matching funds provided by:
"(A) an agency or officer responsible for the supervision of public elementary or secondary education or public higher education within [the
state]...
"(B) the state educational television agency,
"(C) a college or university deriving its support in whole or in part from tax revenues, or
"(D) a nonprofit community educational television organization."

**TOOL FOR CONTROL**

The restriction of Federal grants to public schools would exclude private schools of all sorts, just as was true of the lost Federal aid plan of 1961. Because of discrimination, the groundwork is thus provided for another strong protest from churches supporting their own schools.
A much more serious aspect of this proposal is the immense tool which such an educational facility would provide for Federal control of the content of education by the Federal bureaucracy, in this case by the U.S. Office of Education. It invites brainwashing of children, students, and the public by a Federal bureaucracy.
The same bit of hypocritical semantics barring control by the U.S. Commissioner of Education is present in this bill that has been in all Federal aid to education bills in the past. But just as was the case in last year's bill, actual control will be contrived to put the materials devised by an educational elite in Washington into whatever is called education.

**ENDLESS POSSIBILITIES**

The U.S. Office of Education, quite unwisely from its point of view, could not wait until the bill might pass in the House unnoticed as it did in the Senate, but issued a report by one of its perennial panels which revealed how, under the National Defense Education Act, it would plunge into the business of telling states and local agencies what to teach. The report says that a "nationwide talent search and training program" is needed, etc. And everyone knows that whatever is "nationwide" is the USOE.
Under the provisions of the bill it is easy to see that as the federally subsidized channels are used up the Commissioner of Education will be the dictator as to who shall get these limited resources. And when the channels are all used, there will be none left for private schools. There is also a gadget for further Federal control in that the Commissioner of Education would plan and encourage interstate groupings of the users of the channels.
Ultimately, there would be monolithic control of a vast means of educating the American people. The possibilities are endless.
Finally, there is no need for Federal subsidies. Private institutions, including foundations, have the money and the willingness to help local agencies make use of these channels.
No one questions the immense advantage of using radio and television in education. One gifted teacher could supplement the efforts of hundreds of average classroom instructors. But the channels available should be allocated without discrimination, without Federal subsidies, and with no possibility of monolithic control. Control of educational facilities should remain where it is, at the state and local level.
