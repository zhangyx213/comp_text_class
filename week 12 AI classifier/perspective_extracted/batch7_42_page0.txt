The FBI and a Critic
by RAYMOND MOLEY

I BEGIN this piece on a personal note
for no purpose of self-praise but
because it will help to make a point
which involves a grave matter of na-
tional security. Seventeen years ago
when I left active government service,
President Roosevelt asked me to make
for him a study of Federal laws and
their administration relating to racket-
eering and kidnapping. He placed this
responsibility upon me be-
cause prior to 1932 I had
devoted twelve years to the
observation and study of the
administration of the crimi-
nal law in various states, in-
cluding New York, while he
and his predecessor, Alfred
E. Smith, were in the office
of governor. Those studies
are recorded in three of my
books and in twenty or more
extensive surveys and reports.

In pursuing the investigation di-
rected by the President, I not only
acquainted myself intimately with the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, but
at the request of Hatton Sumners,
then the distinguished Chairman of
the House Judiciary Committee,
sorted out from a batch of bills, pre-
pared by the Department of Justice
and dealing with Federal criminal-
law administration, the ones which
seemed appropriate for action by Con-
gress. In making these selections, Mr.
Sumners and I were keenly actuated
not only by a desire to prevent any
unsafe encroachment of Federal po-
lice powers upon the rights and re-
sponsibilities of the states and local
governments but upon the rights of
individuals under the law.

Mr. MAX LOWENTHAL on the flyleaf
of his currently controversial
book on the FBI has overgenerously
offered me a certain distinction, by
saying that I was "the first of the
Americans to look deeply into the
problems of police and criminal-law
administration." This is a great over-
statement, for I was neither the first,
nor the best, nor the last. However,
in the light of this friendly gesture, I
find it embarrassing to record reluc-
tantly that I regret the general tone
and inadequacies of Mr. Lowenthal's
book. It is an indictment rather than
a survey, a lawyer's brief rather
than a judicious summing up of the
history, services, and value of the FBI.
With respect to the current contro-
versy concerning Mr. Lowenthal him-
self, his motives in writing this book,
his past associations, and his influence
with President Truman, I am not here
concerned. Nor am I concerned with
doing a detailed review of the book.
That is adequately done elsewhere
in this magazine (see page 84).

What is really important
is the status of the FBI it-
self, the confidence of the
public in its efficiency and
integrity, and the impor-
tance that anyone who can
speak with some authority,
as I can, should say, as I
do, that it is by all odds the
most competent police and
investigative agency that
this country has ever seen.

To blame, even by implication, J.
Edgar Hoover or the present bureau
for the Palmer excesses of 1920 is no
more fair than it would be to accuse
President Truman of the sins of Tom
Pendergast. In the one case Mr.
Hoover was a clerk in the FBI, Mr.
Truman a minor machine member.

WHAT is important is that during
and after the recent war, despite
vastly greater internal dangers and
responsibilities, there has been no
repetition of the Palmer activities.
Also important is the fact that for 26
years Mr. Hoover has served under
and had the support of a long series of
Attorneys General, some of whom had
as great a passion for justice and
fairness as has Mr. Lowenthal. Also
greatly important are unmentioned
achievements such as the virtual elim-
ination of kidnapping, the suppression
of espionage and sabotage in the war,
the successful prosecution of the
eleven Communists, Coplon, and Hiss.
When Roosevelt became President
there were powerful political forces
which were determined to oust Mr.
Hoover and put in his place a chief
more amenable to political influences.
I happened to be in the middle
of that fight and I heard all of
the criticisms, most of which inciden-
tally are repeated by Mr. Lowenthal.
The President and Attorney General
Cummings decided for Mr. Hoover,
and for that decision every American
should be thankful.
