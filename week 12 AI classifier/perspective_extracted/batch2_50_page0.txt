**PERSPECTIVE**

**AN AMORAL CLIMATE**

BY RAYMOND MOLEY

In Dayton on Oct. 16 President
Johnson, irritated by placards in
the crowd he faced, listed his promised programs and concluded: "And
if you don't believe in them, you can
go you-know-where."

Implicit here is the freedom of
Americans to judge not only the wisdom of the programs but the man
who proposes them. (And if they
don't like them, they can go...)

So be it, and those who dissent
will find themselves in a goodly company. They may and they may not
be an electoral majority. But they
have fought this year for principles
and personalities for which they will
not be ashamed. Those principles
and their evaluation of Mr. Johnson
will not die with the leaves and
flowers of November. They will stand
as a protest against policies and practices, especially practices, which they
believe to be wrong.

The Jenkins matter is only one
more piece of evidence of an amoral
climate which shrouds this government, the nation's capital, and, measurably, the nation. This has been felt
only once or twice before in our
history. Whether this event is only a
step in the decline in public and
private life or is the spark which will
eventually ignite the embers of a better past, only time will tell.

**SHODDY HENCHMEN**

It is not the misbehavior of a crew
of shoddy henchmen who have held
high favor in our government that
counts so much as the know-nothing,
hear-nothing, admit-nothing posture
of those high in the seats of power.
Billie Sol Estes, Bobby Baker, and
Walter Jenkins are only the presently
known symbols of a cynical indifference to standards which should prevail at the center of our national life.

The reactions of those technically responsible people to those grimy disclosures have a common tone.

Senator Jordan's committee has
slammed the door on a real examination of a condition which threatens
the integrity of the Senate itself.

There is not only the Jenkins arrest on Oct. 7 in a nest which was
well known to the police, but an
earlier police record in 1959 which
was reported to the Secret Service
in 1961. Why the delay?


The President has said that he
knew nothing of this facet of the
character of his trusted right hand.
Secretary Dillon (the Secret Service
is in his department) apparently
knew nothing until the blazing facts
came out. Then he chastised the District of Columbia authorities and the
Secret Service. Robert Kennedy as
Attorney General says he knew nothing of what his subordinates knew.
And finally the chairman of the D.C.
commissioners was not told what the
police under him knew. All these
who say they knew nothing have
been a part of the Federal government of which the President is the
head. But Mr. Johnson lives in a community in which such derelictions as
Jenkins' have been common for years.

**STARK MATERIALISM**

We do know, according to *The
New York Herald Tribune*, that
when on Oct. 14 the news reached
the President in New York, he called
Abe Fortas and told him to get Jenkins' resignation. (Fortas had been
Baker's lawyer.) After looking after
Jenkins, Fortas, accompanied by Clark
Clifford, intimate in the Truman Administration, visited three newspaper
editors in Washington, apparently to
ask that they spare Jenkins in their
publicity. This was silly, since by
noon on Oct. 14, 50 or more reporters knew the story. And so the cover-up failed.

The deeper and the vastly more
important element in this cynical climate is the stark materialism which
has characterized the Johnson campaign. It has been a replay with
variations of the Stevenson campaign
in 1952 when we were told that we
"never had it so good." Handouts for
everybody and privileges for every
minority. Not the good life, but goods
for everybody.

If this tone of the Johnson campaign reflects a correct appraisal of
American character, then something
fine and enlightened has vanished
from our life. For our government
may squander our substance at home
and abroad, and somehow our vast
material resources will survive. But if
the moral tone set by government
and the policies it follows erode the
fiber of our people, the loss is total,
irrecoverable, absolute.
