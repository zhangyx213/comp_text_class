**Admiral Land on Flags**

by Raymond Moley

WHEN Adm. Emory S. Land, Chief
Constructor of the Navy, be-
came eligible for retirement in 1937,
he received a note from the Presi-
dent: "What does the damn fool want
to retire for at his age?-F.D.R." Al-
most immediately, the President car-
ried out the sentiment of his note by
popping his friend "Jerry" into the
toughest jobs of his career, Chairman
of the Maritime Commission and head
of the War Shipping Administration.
There he directed the building, man-
ning, and operation of the greatest
merchant fleet in history.

A pioneer in naval aviation, Admi-
ral Land served for eight postwar
years as president of the Air Trans-
port Association. He is now consultant
to General Dynamics-again in the
pioneering business, in the production
of atomic submarines and aircraft.
The lessons of the several careers of
Admiral Land are plain to read in
his book "Winning the War With
Ships," an urgent reminder that we
must not forget the imprint of ships
on the lives of nations. For that rea-
son, I have sought his opinion on that
part of the American merchant ma-
rine which is registered under the
flags of Panama, Honduras, and Li-
beria. These are the great fleets of
subsidiaries of responsible American
companies engaged in foreign trade.
Admiral Land's comments follow.

**OVERSEAS OPERATIONS**

Q. Why are these ships not reg-
istered under the American flag?
A. Overwhelming economic fac-
tors. About 75 per cent of the eco-
nomic deterrent to United States
registry relates to the cost of crews.
The U.S.-flag seamen get about as
much in two days as European sea-
men get in a week. American wage
standards obviously cannot apply to
American-owned enterprises operat-
ing abroad, where products or serv-
ices are sold in competition with the
world market. Another factor is taxes.
The companies pay full United States
taxes on earnings as they are returned
here. Earnings not returned to this
country, however, provide the capital
for operating and for construction of
new ships.

Q. What if, in the campaign
against them, these fleets are sold
out to "traditional" European flags?
A. Under the flags of Panama,
Honduras, and Liberia these vessels
are now under the effective control of
the United States. That would not be
true if they were under European
flags. At the minimum, we'd pay
through the nose to get them in a
crisis. There would be no time for
negotiation. We cannot put ourselves
in a position of fitting our needs to the
approval or veto of shipowners of the
"traditional" maritime countries. In
peacetime, the nations that control
shipping control trade. The United
States is now a net importer of raw
materials, and it would be exceed-
ingly foolish to permit this great pro-
portion of its tankers and ore carriers
to go into the control of Europe.

Q. What about the accusations
by the American maritime unions
about "conditions and standards" on
these ships?
A. Marine-insurance companies
will not insure or continue the insur-
ance of vessels unless class is main-
tained. The American Bureau of
Shipping recently took exceptional
note of the fact that the ships of these
fleets compare most favorably with
those of any of the other maritime na-
tions. These American companies
maintain conditions, both regarding
vessels and comforts of their crews,
parallel with U.S.-flag ships.

Q. Under the direction of an in-
ternational transport union, a cam-
paign of coercion has been instituted,
with its main target the American-
controlled foreign-flag vessels. Joe
Curran's National Maritime Union and
the Seafarers International Union,
along with the Longshoremen and
Teamsters, are in the American wing
of this campaign. What is the power
of this line-up?
A. They could starve this country
in a month. Many years of dealing
with Curran and his lieutenants
brought me to telling them flatly and
face to face that their policies and
methods were endangering the fu-
ture of their members. Oddly enough,
in private they agreed with me. Do
they want to kill the goose that lays
the golden egg? When European in-
terests are campaigning against all the
major shipping policies of the United
States, this NMU-SIU diversion con-
stitutes a stab in the back.
