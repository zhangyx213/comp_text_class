**PERSPECTIVE**

**THE WAY TO RESUME**

**BY RAYMOND MOLEY**

“The way to resumption is to resume.” That sentiment, widely attributed to John Sherman, was written in 1866 by Salmon Portland Chase in a letter to Horace Greeley. The great editor, who knew a good phrase when he saw one, gave it the needed exposure and other, less original people condensed it into “the way to resume is to resume.” And so I resume after what my friends, the editors, called a “vacation.” It was really a respite to allow time for the unremitting toil of writing a book.

However, it seemed a good time to withhold my cranky advices to Mr. Johnson, since he was undergoing the agonizing reappraisal of life without a gall bladder. I also thought it to be a propitious time to absent myself from the pages of this magazine, since I had celebrated in October a record of 32 years of weekly comment without a break. Enough is enough.

But mostly it was a time—the first four weeks of those melancholy days between Election Day and Christmas—when “the robin and the wren are flown/and from the shrubs the jay.” When the last rose’s “mates of the garden lie senseless and dead.” Gone, too, with the robin and wren and jay and the roses were the normal hot subjects to write about.

**LOTS OF CRIME NEWS**

Writing about a Federal budget is dull enough, but speculation about an unseen budget makes intolerable reading. In these arid days after election and before Congress resumes, political news has no meaning. For the people have spoken, and who durst defy the wisdom of the people? Education is always there but, despite the fact that the academic world has taken to the streets, that subject, as Lord Melbourne said, is awfully boring.

To be sure, there is boundless latitude for speculation about who will run for President in 1968; so much latitude that such talk is meaningless until we know who will turn up in the elections in 1966 and who has a good video image and is against nobody and nothing and is for everything. His may be a new face entirely.

In this period, there is plenty of profitable newspaper advertising, what with the boom and Christmas shopping on the way. This means fat newspapers and the need for editorial material to fill in. Since crime is always with us, the lurid sheets can blow it up to fit any space. Therefore, crime gets a big play in such newspapers and conveys the impression that we are having a crime wave.

It used to be said by sociological bleeding hearts that crime comes with the nip of cold and empty coal bins. The desperate widow grabs the bread knife and slays the baker boy to get food for crying children. Or the cold and hungry outcast climbs into windows or robs the first prosperous-looking pedestrian he sees.

**CRITICS OF THE PRESS**

Back in the years when I studied crime, I conceived the idea that what we witnessed in those distressing days was not a rise in crime, but a rise in crime news. I was research director of the New York Legislature’s Crime Commission, and I set some people to work comparing the amount of newspaper space dealing with crime over the year with the official statistics of reported crime. As I had surmised, there was no correlation, and I wrote my conclusion in a report published by the commission.

My esteemed contemporary, NEWS-WEEK colleague Walter Lippmann, was then editor of The New York World and he scolded the report and the commission in an editorial, seeing in some of the additional comments a design to shackle the press. The commission expired with the end of the legislative term and The New York World died later. But crime and the news of crime are still with us.

Government and the press can be likened to a horse beset by botflies. The winged torturers make free with the animal. But if the horse stamps its feet, shakes its flanks and flicks its tail, the press cites Jefferson, Milton, the Constitution and many court decisions about freedom of the press.

The press is a big grown man now. It is, after religion, the most permanent and solid of institutions. It outlives Presidents and legislative bodies and might even survive constitutional government itself. It should know that criticism is the reminder that there is always room to do better.
