**Perspective**

**The Propheteers**

by RAYMOND MOLEY

All over the world voices are
predicting a depression in America.
These voices speak in many tongues,
from Chinese to Gaelic. Some are sad;
some ring with eager expectation. We
sit in the midst of a vigil, and we are
the prospective corpse.

The persistence of this death watch
since the end of the war suggests the
man who followed a circus all over
Europe. He attended every
performance. "I want to be
present," he said, "when the
lion eats his tamer."

Much of the Soviet Gov-
ernment's attitude toward
peace can be explained by
its expectation of a sharp
American depression. This
expectation precludes a fur-
ther anticipation of Ameri-
can loans and economic co-
operation. Stalin's economic
adviser, Eugene Varga, has been pre-
dicting our depression for a year and
a half. The other day Pravda said the
same thing. An American Communist,
last week debating on one of our net-
works, predicted a capitalist crash in
a few months.

A few of our own economic proph-
ets, who were busy a few weeks ago
predicting bad times, have deserted
the wailing wall. Others press closer
to the stones and moan louder.

It is not within my province to
offer a counterprediction. But to be
skeptical about economic prophets is
not prophecy. And to have such skep-
ticism is the right of a layman. The
habits of many economic prophets are
easy to learn. One of the most re-
nowned soothsayers, now passed to
his reward, would make so many
prophesies that, later on, he could not
fail to claim one that went right. In
1922 he predicted the saturation of
the automobile market. Then every-
body bought a new car. The prophet
kept a straight face and never referred
to his 1922 turkey.

A man enlightened in the ways of
bulls—animal bulls, that is—says wild
bulls hardly ever hurt people. That's
because people expect hostility from
them. It's the Ferdinands that hurt
people, because their occasional gor-
ings are unexpected.

But to be more definite, the signs
are not present. There were red flags
over the farms in 1929, warnings
which Wall Street ignored. Now farm-
ers have money and are spending.

Labor relations are easing, and the
many settlements are reassuring. The
prospects of good labor legislation
were never so good.

Abel Green of Variety, speaking of
a current "downbeat" in the picture
business, quotes Nick Schenck of
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer: "There's
nothing wrong with the picture busi-
ness that good pictures can't cure."

On a broader scale, B. M.
Baruch offers the same ad-
vice. There is nothing wrong
with our economic system
that more production can't
cure.

But as Baruch suggests,
we must remember that a
world economy depends on
goods and the exchange of
goods. It does not live on
money alone. Men must
produce more than they
consume. A flood of dollars through-
out the world only creates more sight
drafts on goods—mostly our goods.
And the value and prestige of those
dollars depend on the volume of goods
they can buy.

The troubles of Britain in the '20s
in sustaining the dominance of the
pound have recently been rehashed
by Attlee and Churchill. Attlee casti-
gated his predecessor because he put
the country on gold in 1925. Churchill
retorted that the Labor party did not
object at the time. But England's trou-
bles were, as we now know, not reme-
died by going on or off gold. They were
caused by a loss in relative efficiency
of production. England stood pat on
antique machinery, plus larger social-
insurance grants. The production plant
of the United States, Canada, Ger-
many and some of Germany's neigh-
bors moved ahead. Industrial effi-
ciency lost by Britain in those years is
a major cause of her present troubles.

There may be bumps ahead in
certain spots. But it is quite likely that
the expectations in Moscow and else-
where of a depression in America will
end in disappointment. The Russians
believe it will come because Marx pre-
dicted it. But the American economic
system has been refuting Marx for
many a year.

An American economic statesman
said the other day: "We couldn't have
a depression if we tried." Perhaps that
is too broad a statement. But a depres-
sion will not come merely because
propheteers say so.
