**The Foundation Investigation**

by Raymond Moley

THE report of the House Committee on Tax-Exempt Foundations is shortly to be made public. If it reflects the information presented in the hearings which have already been published and the comments made public in the newspapers by some of the foundations, there will be plenty of food for thought by such institutions. It may also be that some of the wiser heads in the major foundations will find the time for a fundamental reconsideration of their present policies. For despite the undeniable case that can be made for foundations as such and, if properly administered, the legitimate claim that they have to tax exemption, there are among some of them tendencies that should be redirected and policies that should be changed.

One of the basic justifications of a foundation as an institution is that it provides flexibility in the use of a fortune dedicated by its owner to philanthropic or scientific purposes. In other words, it avoids the danger of what is called "the dead hand," which means the dedication of a fund, perhaps in perpetuity, to a purpose or problem which may disappear subsequent to the death of the donor. A foundation can also provide for long and expensive research in a scientific field, such as public health or medicine. The Rockefeller Institute is an example. Even in that case, it is not the foundation that does the work, but the institution for which the foundation provides the endowment.

This sort of foundation-supported research should probably limit itself to the field of health and the more exact physical sciences. When foundations enter the still cloudy field of what is quite incorrectly called "social science," they ask for trouble. For such investigation almost certainly get into ideological and controversial matters. Since every dollar spent by a tax-exempt foundation must be made up by the generality of taxpayers, those who strongly disagree with the point of view of the foundation can well object to a requirement that they contribute thereto.

In the recent House investigation, the fact was underlined that a number of the very large foundations have supported a point of view which a great many Americans regard as dangerous. I say "underlined" because this discovery is not new. Everyone familiar with the activities of some of those foundations over the years has known that a long time.

There is also the danger in the concentrated power of immense wealth. A few of the major foundations alone have assets running over $2 billion. Beyond them are others, numbering into the thousands, that have assets running to at least $5 billion more. Such immense potential influence needs watching both by Congress and by free agencies of public opinion.

The concentration of power is emphasized when a number of foundations cooperate in supporting such an agency as the Social Science Research Council. In that case approximately twenty foundations contribute, and, through a staff and a number of committees, specific grants are made or recommended to be made for "social" research. The officers of this group will hotly deny any ideological bias, and I will not contest their aim to be fair. But regardless of those who possess it, it is an American tradition that power should not be concentrated either in business, in government, or in the shaping of human minds in education or in disseminating information or opinion. Competition in the market place of ideas is the sure guarantee of human liberty.

There are other dangers to the public interest in the administration of foundations to which I shall allude some time in the future.

IT WAS the real architect of the Rockefeller Foundation and the presiding genius during its earlier and more useful years, Frederick T. Gates, who warned his colleagues, 30 years ago, against entering the field of social "science."

Tax-exempt foundations might well limit themselves or be limited to the war against disease, to the natural sciences, and to grants without strings to established institutions devoted to higher education, religion, or true scientific research.
