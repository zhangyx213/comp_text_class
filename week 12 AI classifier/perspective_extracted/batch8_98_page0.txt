**Prices and Postwar Trade**

Canada's decision to impose a general price, wage and rent ceiling to help ward off inflation is far more significant than most comments on it would have you think. It is, above all, a reminder of how much we have to learn about international trade from the British and their dominions. No one knows better than Prime Minister Mackenzie King that the nation which will sell the most goods in the postwar world will be the nation which keeps it prices and costs down now. The inflation-stricken nation that tries to engage in foreign trade when the war ends will be hit like an umbrella in a hurricane. It will be licked before it can even start to compete with nations that have a reasonably normal price structure.

We, in the United States, for all our concern with postwar planning, are blandly overlooking that grim economic fact. Canada is not. A vastly more industrialized Canada will emerge from this war—a Canada with a more stable fiscal system and an economy fortified by a sound domestic policy toward business. These are among the essential ingredients for successful world trade. The prospects for our lacking most of them grow stronger day by day.

When the announcement was made of Canada's abandonment of piecemeal price control and her adoption of the Baruch plan, supporters of our own piecemeal price-control bill were momentarily stunned. There is no evidence that they thought of it in terms of the relative trading advantage which Canada will properly enjoy. But they obviously were conscious of the reaction of the public to the news that the Administration was urging a method of inflation control which Canada had tossed out as inadequate after a two-year trial.

Mr. Henderson then gave a hasty glance at the Canadian plan and forthwith found new reasons why we should not put Mr. Baruch's proposal into operation. Canada, he explained, had been at war for two years. Her resources are 44 per cent mobilized for defense as compared with our 15 per cent. We had therefore "not reached the stage where we need or could wisely adopt the drastic control Canada has instituted."

So it appears that it is too early to adopt the Baruch plan here. For three or four months those close to Mr. Henderson have insisted it was too late to adopt the Baruch plan. But let that fascinating discrepancy ride and consider another. Last week the President spoke of the importance of who fires the last shot in this war. He called upon the nation to "speak from every assembly line," from the "all-inclusive whole of our vast industrial machine." Does that sound like any 15 per cent mobilization as a basis for planning the future? Does it mean that we need be in no hurry to anticipate some such level as Canada's 44 per cent? If we are to "speak from every assembly line," we shall move far beyond the point that Canada has reached. Even assuming that piecemeal price control would serve effectively at a lower level of mobilization, which we have no reason to assume in view of Canada's experience, there can be no possible doubt that it will fail as we gird ourselves for the degree of mobilization the President himself contemplates.

Mr. Henderson has spoken plaintively of the difficulty of administering the overall ceiling Mr. Baruch recommends. So, too, Canada's Wartime Prices and Trade Board opposed universal price ceilings. Nevertheless, Canada's government has put the job of administering the plan squarely up to it. The administrators will administer it whether they like it or not. If they can't cope with it, other administrators will be called in. We are more tender. The Administration has bowed to Mr. Henderson's views, though that promises to cost us all dearly.

But it would be unfair to lay on Mr. Henderson's doorstep the blame for all that has happened. For its shameful backing and filling over the past three months, Congress must accept full responsibility. Congress cannot plead lack of time: since early August the House Banking and Currency Committee has had before it the halfway measure recommended by the President and championed by Mr. Henderson. Nor can Congress plead ignorance: it has heard the inadequacy of the Administration bill pointed out by Mr. Baruch and a compelling plea for an overall ceiling presented by Congressman Albert Gore.

Inflation-minded themselves, or pulled and hauled about by farm and labor blocs, the members of Congress have frittered away priceless time while prices continue to rise. The relevance and value of the House committee hearings in their later phases are suggested by the testimony of the final witness, a self-styled "old sourdough" named Gimlett, from a ghost mining town in Colorado. Clad in blue jeans and boots, the so-called "Hermit of Arbor Villa" warned the committee against "phony money" and criticized "the pagan tendencies of the effete East."

This might have served usefully if it had reminded Congress that unless it enacts adequate protection against inflation soon it may create more ghost towns than the "Hermit of Arbor Villa" ever dreamed of. But apparently it has not. Congress continues to ignore all warnings—the warning of Canada, the warnings of its own expert witnesses, the warnings of the Administration. It seems determined to inflict on our nation the bitter experience of learning at firsthand the truth of Mr. Gore's solemn advice: "History reveals no instance of a country which suffered inflation because of taking measures which were too strong. The longer one delays in taking broad effective action, the harder the task becomes and the more drastic are the measures needed…"

**Good Neighbors**

This list is far from complete. But it includes the following choice collection of names which Mayor La Guardia applied in the course of his campaign to those who opposed his third-term candidacy. Some unnamed people were "dirty, contemptible liars" and "yellow cowardly curs." Governor Lehman was "that dope, Herbie." Ed Flynn, Democratic National Chairman, was a "rogue" and a "leech." Mr. Farley was "the Flop." An assorted lot of people were "double-crossers," and "selfish, greedy, incompetent, despicable, two-by-four peanut politicians." Holding high a specimen of that autumnal autocrat of the markets, a cabbage, Mr. La Guardia called it "my opponent's head."

This was too much. Mr. Farley returned the fire with "cad," "liar," "mugwump" and "breast-beating faker." Mr. Flynn stung to action, added "vain popinjay," a "mucker running amuck," a "most super-colossal hypocrite." Mr. Farley also referred to certain "obscene," unprintable language sent by the Mayor to an editor who did not agree with him.

But the campaign ended on a note of elevation. Speaking in a church in Brooklyn, Mr. La Guardia recommended prayer. "Pray," he intoned, "for forgiveness of those evil men with hatred in their hearts who, with strong words on their tongues, hurling invective and vituperation, create racial hatred because they are so desperate. Pray for them—they need it. Let us be serene, kindly and forgiving—for they know not what they do."

Unfortunately, all hands at this game knew very well what they were doing—knew that it was not contributing either to the cause of serenity or kindliness or national unity.
