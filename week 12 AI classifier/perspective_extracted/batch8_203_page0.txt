**Perspective**

**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

**What Is Aggression?**

After his third defeat for the
Presidency, William Jennings Bryan de-
scribed his feelings roughly as follows: "A
man taking a present to another man was
thrown down the stairs and onto the side-
walk. He went up the stairs again, with a
like result. He did it a third time. And
then, at last, picking himself up, he said:
'It seems that man just doesn't like me.'"
Nothing could be more descriptive of
Washington's tragicomic reaction to For-
eign Minister Molotoff's belligerent speech
last week. Not a little of the piquancy of
this incident in our foreign policy comes
from the contrast between our reaction
and that of the British and French. The
French, seasoned over the centuries to
Russian antics, shrug their shoulders and
say nothing. England, speaking through
the Prime Minister, refuses to be insulted.
Our Administration is very, very nettled,
indeed by the bad, bad Russian. In fact,
Washington is annoyed to a point that
might seem excessive if it weren't plain
that it took even more than three kicks
down the stairs to convince Washington
that "that man just doesn't like me."

For weeks and months the pretense has
been that relations of the utmost sym-
pathy, understanding and affection existed
between the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R.
Meanwhile, our "liberals" were finding ex-
cuses for everything that Russia had done.
About Americans who consistently con-
tended that both Communism and Naz-
ism are inimical to the way of life we want
to maintain here, the "liberals" shrieked
"pro-Hitler." As to the Russo-German
trade agreement in August, they insisted
that it did not indicate any flagging in
Stalin's great love for democracy.

The Stalin-Hitler agreement on August
24th was a stiffer dose. But the "special
patience and understanding" which our
"liberals" had always reserved for Soviet
Russia had reached a fantastic point of
elasticity. Great Britain was to blame,
they said. Chamberlain's government had
dawdled. It had refused to give adequate
guarantees to Russia in the Baltic. Poland
had absurdly refused to accept the benefi-
cent aid of Soviet troops on its own soil
—had refused it at the behest of Great
Britain. Anyhow, what was all the shout-
ing for? The Stalin-Hitler agreement posi-
tively did not mean that Russia would be
a military ally of Germany.

Ensued the movement of Russian troops
into Poland, Russian participation in one


of the most ruthless partitions in history,
and finally the bludgeoning of Latvia,
Estonia, Lithuania and Finland.
One might have been excused for think-
ing that human ingenuity could not be
strained so far as to produce alibis for
these events. But the boys were still equal
to the occasion. It took them only a spell
to collect themselves. Then there emerged
not only from the "liberal" journals, from
the columns of the fellow-travelers, from
the pinks in educational institutions, but
from the gabble of the Palace Guard in
Washington, a brand new set of explana-
tions. They began to announce that, be-
fore the treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the Rus-
sians had been promised the territory they
have now begun to gobble up—promised
it by the Allies to protect the Russian bor-
der. It also appeared that the Russians,
in invading Poland, had been actuated by
the altruistic desire to protect Polish peas-
ants from German oppression. And more
than all this, it was said, Stalin's "bril-
liant" strategy had done what the British
and French had lamentably failed to do.
It had checkmated Hitler.

The Administration, apparently influ-
enced more by the Palace Guard point of
view than by the sound sense of the State
Department, continued to treat Russia in
a way wholly unlike that he employed in
the case of Germany. There were no official
appeals resembling those which came
hurtling out of Washington in the Munich
crisis. The remonstrance to Russia with
regard to Finland was handled with ex-
quisite tact. Our ambassador delivered a
personal message from the President to
Mikhail Kalinin, President of the Soviet
Union, expressing the earnest personal
hope that Russia would mind its manners.

Now comes the Molotoff speech. And
how rude Molotoff was! Just as friends of
Russia had put together a fine new alibi,
Molotoff kicks it to pieces. The "check-
mating" of Germany that our friends on
the Left have been talking about bears a
quite different name when Molotoff speaks
of it. He calls it "practical cooperation"
with Germany. This is a nice way to treat
our Little Lord Fauntleroy diplomacy! Ap-
parently Molotoff doesn't know a friend
when he sees one.

Unfortunately, no one can have much
sympathy for our Little Lord Fauntleroy
diplomacy, because when it wanders half
way across the earth and tries to bring
sweetness and light to a ruthless dictator-
ship, it ought to know it will probably get
hurt. It is now brushing from its clean
white collar a large and rather sticky piece
of Russian mud. Tears cannot wash off
this mud, nor can the beating of an angry
heart jar it loose. The best place for Little
Lord Fauntleroy diplomacy is at home
when the former denizens of cellars, sew-
ers, jails, prison camps and beer halls are
loose in Europe. They are tough hombres.
Unless we want to be tough, too, we'd bet-
ter not fool with them.

Mr. Chamberlain's diplomacy is of a
different type. If a clear idea can be said
to have emerged from his speech last
week, it is that he is not particularly con-
cerned about the aggression of Russia in
Northern Europe. Apparently, the cause
of democracy isn't impaired by Russian
penetration of the democracies of North-
ern Europe. It is possible that democracy
will not really be impaired in Mr. Cham-
berlain's eyes until Russia starts to march
into Northern India and to interfere with
democratic institutions there. Meanwhile,
Mr. Chamberlain refuses to get angry, and
the Very Rev. Dr. Hewlett Johnson, Dean
of Canterbury Cathedral, had a perfectly
straight face when he announced, last
week, that Communism has recovered the
essential form for the real belief in God.
He added that certain events in Russia
"are keeping the standard of righteousness
forward." He also said that the Russian
revolution was spiritual.

When such fellows as Hitler and Stalin
get together, it's always fair weather—at
home.

**The Voices of Authority**

Some connoisseur of historical an-
ecdotes might write an interesting piece
on the infinite variety of ways through
which rulers of states choose to speak.
There are many times when rulers want to
say something publicly but for various
reasons cannot use the ex-cathedra method
of a direct statement. They speak, as it
were, from behind the curtain, and this
curtain may be many different kinds of
things. It may be a trusted Minister or a
favorite semi-official newspaper, such as
is common in the totalitarian states of
Europe. In Washington it has ranged
from Mr. Coolidge's quaint "White House
spokesman" to the familiar "someone high
in authority."

The President has recently made an in-
teresting innovation in permitting his sec-
retary, Mr. Early, to make important
statements of policy through direct state-
ments to the press. There has been some
muttered complaint about this new de-
vice. But Steve Early is a man of excel-
lent judgment, of rare calm and of scrupu-
lous fairness in dealing with the press.
Those who have had the privilege of
knowing him can give the assurance that
he will perform this new service with all
the native caution and conscientious care
that have characterized his other work.
