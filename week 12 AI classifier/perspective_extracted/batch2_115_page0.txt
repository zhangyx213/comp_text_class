**PERSPECTIVE**

**Politics vs. Government**

by Raymond Moley

LAST week Americans saw an institution which once had great usefulness again mauled about and all but destroyed by political ambitions and political expediency. I have attended several Governors Conferences over the years, but I skipped this one because I chose to eliminate a trip to Florida to see what I knew would happen and hear what I already knew. Governor Rockefeller has been governor long enough to realize what value a sincere interchange of knowledge and experience can contribute to that respect and efficiency which state governments so sorely need.

But the purple rage which has recently emerged from his frustrated Presidential ambitions has impaired his judgment. He seems willing, like Samson, to bring down the structure to destroy his enemies. And he also may have destroyed much of his own usefulness in public affairs.

Back in 1926 the Governors Conference achieved a monumental improvement in state governments everywhere. Under the leadership of Harry F. Byrd, then governor of Virginia, and Gov. Alfred E. Smith of New York, the conference promoted the spread of the executive budget system in many states. Over the years since the Civil War state functions had proliferated, and almost all estimates went directly to the legislatures piecemeal. To pull those requests for appropriations into one coherent executive budget marked a new era. Later the conferences promoted central purchasing and, still later, personnel administration. Such reforms can mean protections against what even Rockefeller has regarded as a danger, the concentration of power in Washington.

**QUEST FOR EFFICIENCY**

Those reforms came from a serious interchange of ideas among the governors of the states. They were not exciting subjects. They failed to draw the host of reporters that now attend the conferences. They made little news and no headlines.

In those days, there developed the principle that all resolutions must be by unanimous votes of those present. Indeed, at that time an observer could hardly tell from the discussions whether this or that governor was a Democrat or a Republican. For efficient administration should know no party lines. In times of crises these gatherings have been most useful. In the depression there was the problem of public assistance to be considered; in war, such matters as the administration of rationing, etc.

Controversial and partisan subjects were avoided, and votes on them were prevented by the rule of unanimity. Trouble began as soon as there was adopted a provision which required a three-fourths and later a two-thirds vote. Politics supplanted efforts to improve state governments.

**ENTER PARTISANSHIP**

In the 1940s Governor Dewey and a few others introduced more and more national politics into the conferences. In two of every four of the years, news of the conference was almost totally devoted to Presidential politics. The conferences were made a forum for the exhibitionism of ambitious governors. The greatest decline from the original purpose of the conferences came in 1952 when Governors Dewey, Sherman Adams of New Hampshire, and Dan Thornton of Colorado secured a unanimous vote of the Republican governors present for General Eisenhower for President. Someone said ironically after that smashing headline: "There is no need for a national convention now. Taft is finished."

The performance last year at Hershey, Pa., was disgraceful. Zealous integrationists thrust the civil-rights issue into the proceedings. A filibuster ensued, and all matters of state importance were forgotten.

This year a similar farce was prevented because the Democratic governors solidly voted to eliminate all resolutions from that and succeeding conferences. I suppose that there were mixed reasons for this action by the Democrats. But I am sure that at least a few of them were moved by the laudable purpose of returning the Governors Conference to its original role of dealing seriously with state affairs. Plunging national politics into these gatherings has all but destroyed their usefulness.
