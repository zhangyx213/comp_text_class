**PERSPECTIVE**

**How to Pay for Liberty**

by Raymond Moley

OUR two-party system is the living
transmission line between Americans and
their servant, the government. A
constitution without an electoral system is a
mere debenture exacted from an unreliable
master. Elections without alternative choices
are, as we know, the screen under which
dictatorships operate. Many choices usually
end in no choices. The two-choice system has
kept the Anglo-American peoples free.

But here in America we have a disgracefully
bad way of paying what is necessary to keep
our parties alive and operating. We pay billions
to help maintain alien peoples under free
institutions. We squander other billions for
useless services. But we put our political
parties in a position which is humiliating and
irregular—not to say inequitable and
immoral—because of the devices and tricks
which they must use to pay the costs of
presenting their cases to the electorate. Thus,
millions of decent citizens shun any party
affiliation at all. And fine individuals who
could serve their country well in public office
reject politics because they know that they
would, if elected, be saddled with obligations to
innumerable special interests who contributed
to their victory. President Kennedy is as much
aware of this as anyone in public life.


**EXCELLENT REPORT**

Consider, for example, the various
money-raising dinners at which even Presidents
are among the luminaries. Single tickets and
tables are solicited from individuals or companies
who seek the goodwill of the government or the
party. At some of these dinners elaborate
brochures are distributed with plenty of
advertising, some of it from institutions which
have tax or other advantages which they seek to
preserve. This is a poor way to honor the
speakers or the parties.

Let us look at a more general situation. Much
of the financing of the Republican Party is from
individuals of wealth and business stature. Then,
after the election, Democrats publicize this as
evidence that the Republican Party is of the rich
and “big business.” On the other hand, the
Democratic Party’s candidates get immense sums
collected by labor unions.

In both cases the two parties are put under
heavy obligations to special interests. Good
members of both parties deeply deplore this.

The proper correction is through tax credits and
deductions at the Federal level. For the burden of
supporting our political parties should rest on
taxpayers, who enjoy the indispensable services
they perform.

The Commission on Campaign Costs appointed
by the President has recognized this principle in
its excellent report. I omit here a summary of the
commission’s recommendations. I agree with them
in principle but differ in details. The report has
been well covered in the press.


**RIGHT IN PRINCIPLE**

Several months ago I suggested in an article that
there should be Federal legislation permitting a tax
credit up to $10 for contributors of smaller means
and tax deductions up to $3,000 for those who can
afford it. The money would go to the national
committees of the parties, to be distributed in a way
prescribed by law and duly reported in income-tax
returns. This would apply to Federal elections
only. This means of financing those election
campaigns would free state and local organizations
to raise money without the handicap of contributors
having been canvassed by the national parties.

This system would be fair to both parties. It would
still require the party organizations to work for
contributions. And it would place the support of both
parties where it should be—on the millions of small
contributors. People who have a share in the party
work harder for it.

The plan of the President’s commission falls short
by its limitation of such financing to Presidential
elections. The plan should apply to the election of
members of Congress, too. The limit it places,
$1,000, would be inadequate to raise the necessary
money. And its method of enforcement is too
complicated. But it is right in principle, and good
citizens everywhere should urge Congress to adopt it
in some modified form. We all should pay for the
means of maintaining liberty and orderly government
through the party system.
