**Dollar War at Home**

by Raymond Moley

INFLATION, like vice, is "a monster of
so frightful mien, as to be hated
needs only to be seen." But "seen too
oft, familiar with her face," many of
us first endure and then embrace it.
For under our present-day complex
economic system, there does not ap-
pear the old naked conflict between
debtors and creditors which charac-
terized so many political conflicts in
our history. The combatants now are a
multitude of interests, and countless
numbers of us have divided concerns.
A precise listing of those whose in-
terests are imperiled by inflation has
been made by Dr. Marcus Nadler, an
able consulting economist. They are
holders of life-insurance policies; de-
positors in commercial and savings
banks; owners of E, F, and G savings
bonds; members of credit unions;
postal savers; Federal civilian re-
tirees, and state and local employes;
the noninsured under private retire-
ment plans; railroad retirees. In the
Nadler summation there are 269 mil-
lion individuals with these anti-
inflationary interests, and their stake
is many, many billions of dollars.
However, it must be noted that
there are many duplications in this
summary, since people may have sev-
eral of these interests. There are also
many who appear in a listing of those
whose interests favor inflation.

**THE PRO-INFLATIONISTS**

Dr. Julius Hirsch, an American eco-
nomic consultant who was Economic
Secretary in the Weimar republic
during the great German inflation in
the 1920s, has supplied me with a
carefully considered classification of
those in our society who have,
whether they know it or not, interests
on the side of inflation.
These are farm owners, and also
those who are self-employed, hired
hands, and others directly dependent
upon agriculture; owners of real es-
tate, notably mortgaged property;
owners of other "real" goods and fa-
cilities (not dollars or dollar claims),
especially owners of mining, manu-
facturing, transportation, and most
service enterprises; most debtors
whose interest in a shrinking dollar
becomes greater according to the
length of term embodied in the debt;
"personal" debtors, including install-

ment debtors; and members of labor
unions with some assurance of esca-
lating devices.
To these I would add the part of
our vast Federal civilian bureaucracy
which will profit by personal promo-
tion and other opportunities in more
and more government spending. Sev-
enteen per cent of all employed
Americans work for government.
The sum total of the individuals in-
volved in these interests rivals that
of Dr. Nadler's total who should op-
pose inflation. And the dollars in-
volved number considerably more.
But there is also vast duplication in
these figures. For millions have di-
vided interests. In great numbers
pensioners, savers, and holders of life-
insurance policies own real estate or
owe money in many forms. The man-
ufacturer faces conflicting concerns
between his inventory and his future
needs to buy raw material. He also
has the problem of competition and
sales resistance to higher prices.

**AFTER THE JOY RIDE**

Dr. Hirsch also lists a large class
which favors inflation for some non-
material concern-sympathy, habit,
real or fancied desire to help others.
He cites a mother living on a pension
or insurance who has a son who is
deep in debt.
I would add those millions who
vote by habit for the party of their
tradition although its candidates may
favor inflationary spending. Also, those
who believe in a candidate who says
categorically that he is for the little
people, the weak or needy or op-
pressed. Or who vote for the glib,
personable politician who chooses to
see nothing beyond the next election.
Then there are the empty-headed
who relish the joy ride of inflation.
And, finally, the speculators who be-
lieve themselves smart enough to ride
the tide. Many are like the man fall-
ing from the top of the building who
shouts to the friend halfway down:
"This is great, while it lasts."
It will be quite useless for the Pres-
ident and his advisers to appeal only
in behalf of the people on fixed in-
comes and others whose dollars will
buy less and less. He must get over
to everyone the dire end when hys-
teria supplants reason.
