Hybrid Parties

by RAYMOND MOLEY

The amazing snake dance of the
Truman Administration and the Han-
negan National Committee over the
Wallace affair continues. The many
contradictions of the President are
known to all. The Democratic Na-
tional Committee has continued the
zigzag. It was first announced that it
would sponsor no Wallace speeches.
At this writing, it is added that there
will be sponsored speeches
in Wisconsin, Illinois, Indi-
ana, and perhaps Michigan.
By the time these words are
in type, there may be more
developments.

This reluctance to cut the
party strings on Wallace rep-
resents a profound fear of
alienating the many ele-
ments who think and act with
this extraordinary leader.

The capacity of Henry
Wallace to organize a party or move-
ment is open to question. He dreams
and thinks in wide spaces peculiarly his
own. But the emblem and prophet of
a mass movement can leave organizing
to others. In the diverse elements
which share the Wallace convictions
and prejudices, there is highly trained
organizing ability. The PAC has shown
that. The many so-called intellectuals
who have provided ideological pabu-
lum for the leftish margin in recent
Democratic majorities have a great
propensity to form committees, write
round robins and arrange meetings.
They are, like Wallace, easily articulate.

Moreover, there are vast areas
outside the cities where certain types
of spiritual leaders are made to order
for Wallace. He is known as a devotee
of other-worldly matters. A man may
be disdained in orthodox conservative
circles, but, as Mencken once bitterly
remarked in connection with Bryan,
"out where the bilge of Idealism ran
in the veins…and men gathered who
were weary and heavy laden…there
the indefatigable Jennings set up his
traps and spread his bait." And so, it
may be added, did Huey Long, Dr.
Townsend and others. This rich field
is known to Henry Wallace, and it
can yield him a hybrid crop of votes.
Those who bleed with Wallace may be
a massive host.

The ensanguined Wallaceites will
not be as cautious as their leader may
be in his speeches for Democratic
candidates this fall. They will claim
that only through a return to Roose-
veltian policies can there be succor.
The familiar device, "F.D.R.," will
shine on their banner. Wallace was
the last and, to them, brightest of the
clan. It may be that only a depression
can give Wallace a chance in the 1948
Democratic convention. But to know
the jargon of the authentic New Dealer
of prewar days is to know that they
always believed that President Roose-
velt, while a great means of
arousing popular enthusi-
asm, rallying voters and
winning elections, was only
the John the Baptist of the
new day. Another prophet
was to come, and compro-
mise was to stop at some un-
specified time in the future.
Thus the Wallaceites may
even welcome a defeat in
1948. Your true political
extremist is hypermetropic.

He looks to the election after next and
beyond. He believes that Republicans
make depressions and he dreams of a
revival of the 1932 drama when the
country and the world were in the
throes of the worst depression in
modern time.

The effect of Democratic discontent
is apparent to shrewd Republicans,
and the Wallace incident is greeted
with wassail and song. A mild, Ferdi-
nand-like bull market resulted. Repub-
lican candidates will challenge oppo-
nents with sharp interrogations: Are
you a Wallace Democrat or a Truman
Democrat? Whom are you for-Pep-
per or Byrd? In California this em-
barrassment has already been pre-
sented to Will Rogers Jr. In New York,
Candidate Ives has suggested it to
Candidate Lehman.

But before minuets are danced
on Park and North Michigan Avenues,
let a word of caution be introduced.
The Republican party will show no
real division within itself until after
the Congressional election. But as
candidacies looking toward 1948 take
shape, the split character of the GOP
will appear. Irreconcilable differences
may emerge. A great ideological gap
stands between men like Reece and
Taft, on one hand, and Stassen and
Morse, on the other. Many new Re-
publican senators and congressmen
may appear who will resent leadership
by any old guard.

In any event, as "My Day" might
say, we shall certainly be living in
interesting times.
