**California Talks Back**

When will Easterners learn not to fool with the lustrous pride that Californians have in their state? The latest to feel the inevitable sting of their resentment is a man who should have known better. Early in August the President of the United States, telling the voters of California not to return Hiram Johnson to the Senate, said that he did not think that anyone in his wildest dreams could regard Senator Johnson as a liberal or progressive Democrat in the year 1940. Well, 483,328 Democrats had just such wild dreams—which was more than all the assorted Democrats and others who opposed Johnson could gather together. Republicans—581,858 of them—had wild dreams too. In thirty years of victory Hiram Johnson has never enjoyed such a vote of confidence. And so wild dreams are now due to visit the Democratic Presidential candidate and his campaign managers. For politicians are superstitious men, and there is a superstition about California. In 1916 Mr. Hughes appears to have unwittingly slighted Johnson in California. California rejected Mr. Hughes. The superstition originated then. It brought forth more goose pimples among Democratic politicians when Roosevelt visited that state in 1932 than a swim in the Arctic. By virtue of great tact and a warm endorsement of Senator Johnson, Mr. Roosevelt won California. But in 1938 the old Roosevelt political insight failed. Mr. Roosevelt strongly endorsed Senator McAdoo. The voters rejected his advice. A still more emphatic negative has now been registered. The ominous threat of the superstition seems on the way to fulfillment.

There is nothing of the supernatural in what has happened this year. Personal observation throughout the August campaign made it clear to me that events were unfolding quite logically. In no state are party lines so shadowy. No state has believed in progressive ideas so long and so ardently. No state has recently suffered so much from spurious progressivism. The candidacy of Senator Johnson offered voters the opportunity to register their opinions on all three of these points.

The Johnson vote disregarded Roosevelt’s plea on party grounds. On primary day California Democrats decided that Johnson was a Democrat and Republicans decided that he was a Republican. Did Mr. Roosevelt question Johnson’s progressivism? Who was Mr. Roosevelt to tell Californians the meaning of progressivism?


California had a New Deal when Mr. Roosevelt was in college. Finally, great numbers of Californians had decided that the old progressive and the old progressivism were best. And many exponents of the new radicalism rolled in the dust on primary day.

Can Mr. Willkie carry the state? Yes, with a few important ifs. If he can make California believe that he believes in the sort of enlightened government that people thought they were voting for in 1932. If he can make them believe that he is a capable executive. If he can make them believe that, California-wise, he’s not overly concerned with party labels. And a speech or two by Hiram Johnson would clinch it.

**Advice From Abroad**

Since de Tocqueville, we have been getting the once-over by European savants. Americans seldom object to this, although it must be admitted that when Americans try to tell Europeans how to run their affairs, they are usually told to mind their own business. But we listen courteously enough to advice about ourselves because we believe that we may sometimes learn even from outsiders. And when an outsider happens to be a great, tactful and judicious man like the late Lord Bryce, his comments upon our affairs become a part of our intellectual tradition.

But the man who sends us the latest batch of advice from abroad does not care for Lord Bryce. In his book, *The American Presidency*, which has been ecstatically received by leftist book reviewers, Professor Harold J. Laski of the University of London devotes several pages to academic fencing with the shade of Bryce and concludes that the advice of Bryce must be considered in the light of the fact that he “brought with him to America, in a word, a social philosophy, a way of life, that set the criteria not only of what he was to look for, but also of what he found.” Well, so has Professor Laski. And since Professor Laski has invited it, the comment may be made that Bryce spent years quietly observing us before he wrote about us, and that he looked at us a lot more than he talked at us.

What is immediately important about Laski’s book is its emergence in the midst of a Presidential campaign. That element of timeliness, together with the unbounded admiration it displays for President Roosevelt, makes it a kind of campaign document. It is as such that it must be examined, even if Mr. Ickes does charge discourtesy to anyone who presumes to say anything about the Presidency.

The essence of the Laski plea is that the American President needs power, and yet more power. “Great power makes great leadership possible,” he says. As for the nation, it must, if it would “live creatively…discipline itself to trust, in the grand manner, the leaders of its choice.” So here we are! No doubt it is creative living that the Indians in every South American dictatorship enjoy. The only distinction involved seems to be that, according to the Laski prescription, the “grand manner” characterizes people who give up their power to a leader and does not characterize people when someone takes their power away from them. Still, the nation ends up in precisely the same place. And ultimately, the people yearn for a little less creative living and a little more personal liberty. For the accepted synonyms of the word “leader” have some terrifying connotations.

Professor Laski does not tell us what the ultimate economic and social system should be in this book. But he has done so elsewhere. Since he invites us to place ourselves quietly in the hands of a leader, we have the right to ask where Laski would like to have the leader take us. In 1935 he told us in his book, *The State*: “Once more we can see before us the beginnings of a new order. Once more the economic process has become incompatible with the political forms in which it is contained.” So it would seem that we need more power in the hands of the leader because we are going to have a new order. Professor Laski elaborated his thesis last year at the University of Wisconsin. According to *The New York Times*, he said on April 7, 1939: “Should war be forced upon us and we see the old, ugly, imperialist aims dominating the rulers of the democracies, we of the Labor party and the working class everywhere see it as our duty to turn those wars into civil wars and remake those governments which disregard the working classes which are their foundations.”

It is hardly necessary to comment upon the Laski thesis in its entirety. Summed up, it is a program that most Americans find exceedingly distasteful. We do not believe that “the economic process has become incompatible with the political forms in which it is contained.” We shall not accept a “new order” which comes through a dictatorship masquerading in the forms of democracy or which launches itself in a civil war begun in the midst of a war with another nation. Perhaps Mr. Laski will find Americans pretty funny in the way they shrink with horror from such prospects. But he’ll have to take us as we are. And the vast majority of us in this democracy still believe in the democratic ideal—still prefer the ideas of Bryce to the “new order” of Laski.
