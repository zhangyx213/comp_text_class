**HIGHWAY REVOLUTION-I**

BY RAYMOND MOLEY

We have heard a lot about the revolution in space. We are all paying for it in taxes. Some of us use the air for travel. But down there where most of us live and work, miles under the jet on which we are riding, where little bugs move along on thin ribbons of roads, there has been an equally sensational revolution closer to our lives.

To gather material for the political comments I have written during the past 47 days, we—this writer and his helpmeet and helpdrive—have traveled 6,400 miles on the highways of twenty states in the South and Southwest. This spring trip has been routine in most years since 1948. There have also been summer trips from coast to coast in those years.

Such trips serve two purposes. They provide grist for political comment which is not available in New York or Washington. And they serve as a substitute for the ordeal of boring vacations which neither refresh nor inform.

Now, in May, when nothing political is what it seems to be, I shall skip politics and offer a few notes of greater concern to most Americans than who is to be nominated or elected. The revolution in touring during these sixteen years has been in the character of the highways, the accommodations en route, and the automobiles which carry us on the way.

**BETTER SPEED**

Back there shortly after the war, the roads and highways offered variety but little else. There were long stretches suitable for fast travel in such states as Wyoming and Montana. But where most people live there was little to make touring pleasant or even tolerable. There were narrow two-lane paths, wretched passages through city and town streets, plenty of traffic lights, perilous mountain roads, and alternating motion behind trucks that thundered downhill and crawled upgrade. Some states, like Texas, had fine stretches in the open spaces. But hours gained there were lost in the cities.

With the slow construction of the Federal interstate highways, the situation has radically changed. I omit statistics but offer the simple observations we have made over the years. Ten or more years ago, we regarded 300 miles by 3 o'clock as a good pace. Four hundred by 4 o'clock was unusual. Now it is often 300 miles by lunchtime and 500 miles by 4. We never travel by night, and plan a start when breakfast is available, by 7 or before.

Seventy miles an hour is normal and legal almost everywhere on these new highways. Their construction is equal to or better than the older turnpikes built by the states. The information displayed by the highway signs is complete and explicit.

**GREATER SAFETY**

Any critical comment about this vast construction operation is beyond the scope of these notes. But there are evidences from my superficial, if extended, observations that it would seem that in some instances the volume of traffic hardly justifies the priorities. There are considerable stretches which might have waited until more adequate city bypasses were built. But these bypasses present to the government difficult problems of rights of way and the pressures of local interests.

There can be no question about the vast improvement in safety conditions. In earlier travels we saw many evidences of serious, even fatal, accidents. But on this most recent trip we saw only one overturned truck and one car in the ditch.

The states have greatly improved policing, which, after all, is a major key to safety. For without the restraints of police, the opportunity for accelerated speed would invite the excesses of highway lunatics.

Information about routes and highway conditions is available to prospective travelers through certain major oil companies or through the American Automobile Association. Repairs are available everywhere.

It may well be that this expansion of the lives of Americans by this Federal highway system will stand as the most important contribution of the Eisenhower Administration.

But highways alone are not enough. In another piece I shall offer some comments on living accommodations and also the vehicles which carry the traveler. These, too, represent immense change.
