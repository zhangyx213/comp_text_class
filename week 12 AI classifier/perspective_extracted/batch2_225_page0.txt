**Four Years—Too Many**

by Raymond Moley

A YEAR ago, president Grayson Kirk
of Columbia University wrote this
indictment of the four-year college
course: "Four years in some adoles-
cent playpens that are called cen-
ters of learning may be a pleasant
interlude for young people, but it is
a luxury which they, their parents,
the colleges, and the country can no
longer afford."

This sharpens and confirms my own
impression after three decades—first
as a full-time and later as a part-time
university professor. It comes with
added emphasis now when the na-
tion's taxpayers are about to be
nicked again for Federal aid to stu-
dents and colleges.

The four-year tradition began in
medieval times when Oxford and
Cambridge were created. English
gentlemen welcomed a quiet sanctu-
ary for their sons until they were old
enough to assume the responsibilities
of life. The time spent in the univer-
sities also helped prepare men for the
ministry, the professions, scholarship,
the military, and also just for "gra-
cious" living in an aristocracy. Har-
vard, following the English pattern in
1636, set the style which still prevails
generally in the United States.

**UNNECESSARY VACATIONS**

Imprisoned in this tradition, col-
leges have devised plausible means of
stretching out their offerings from
September of the first year to June of
the fourth. Long vacations help a lot—
three months in the summer, and
weeks for Christmas and Easter holi-
days. Those happy days off are usu-
ally consumed in loafing or in going to
and getting over innumerable parties.
For an industrious few, the summer
can be used to earn some money. But
considering the ultimate loss to the
colleges, it would be cheaper to pro-
vide loans and scholarships.

The male high-school graduate now
is faced not only by the necessity for
preparing for a vocation after college,
but by years of military service. If the
boy chooses to enter a profession, he
will not be ready to earn a living until
his middle or late 20s. The surgeon
earns little or nothing until he is 30 or
more. This is an injustice to the stu-
dent and an intolerable burden on
most parents.


But even with the months of actual
study limited by bounteous vacations,
the academic offering has been heav-
ily diluted with plenty of soft or ir-
relevant courses.

The observations that follow may
not apply so specifically to the learn-
ing of foreign languages or science.
But they certainly apply to the dis-
ciplines with which I am most familiar,
the social sciences.

**WASTED TIME, TALENT**

In that part of the curriculum, fac-
ulty members with four years to thin
out their offering can move with the
utmost leisure. Courses are given
which need not be taught, only read
in books. Usually a faculty member
has an introductory course for "fun-
damentals." Then a moderately
advanced course which merely elab-
orates the introductory course. And
for the third course, a recapitulation
of the first two. Too often the wisdom
and knowledge of a professor could
with efficiency be imparted in one
full year's course.

But the colleges justify this part-
time use of talent because they want
"research" and the writing of books.
Jacques Barzun, dean of the Gradu-
ate Faculties at Columbia, takes sharp
issue with this insistence upon what is
called productive research and schol-
arship. Too often it is merely an "ex-
cuse for a flight from teaching." And
the pressure on young teachers to
"produce" means gross neglect of stu-
dents and classrooms. Indeed, the
gifted and inspiring teacher is under
a heavy penalty. The dull fellow who
can neither teach nor write well is
the beneficiary.

The college plant is also ineffi-
ciently used. President Kirk estimates
that the plant is in operation only
about 46 per cent of the time. With a
rise of more than 100 per cent in en-
rollment to 7 million in prospect by
1970, such inefficiency is deplorable.
The remedy is three college years
of eleven months each. Faculty mem-
bers might choose time off for writing
or travel, or more pay. There would
be a faster turnover of students and
less expense for parents, colleges, tax-
payers, and donors. And students
would be able to add a year to
their productive life.
