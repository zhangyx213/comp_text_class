Speak Softly, Butâ€”
by Raymond Moley

THE President's fiscal policy might
be described as "Speak softly, but
carry a big check." The road to the
radical plans revealed in the 1958
budget estimates was strewn with
soft, conservative assurances. In 1936
President Roosevelt reversed the
order. He asked for the preparation of
a radical State of the Union message
to cover a conservative retreat in his
budget. In the Eisenhower message,
this was the emphasis:
"Freedom... is the opportunity for
self-discipline... the principal threat
to efficient functioning of a free-
enterprise system is inflation... the
danger is always present, particularly
if the government might become
profligate... The Federal government
shall utilize only a prudent share of
the nation's resources, that it shall live
within its means..."

The tone of reassurance is carried
into the budget message itself,
despite its ominous figures. The simple
figures, $71,800,000,000 and
$73,600,000,000, representing requested
expenditures and estimated receipts
are far from a complete story of what
is contemplated in the future. Far over,
on page 993 of the bulky budget, is the
information that a multitude of trust
funds, also a part of the government,
will be paying out $14,350,000,000 in
1958 as compared with $9,434,000,000
in 1956. Four years ago the trust funds
paid out only $5,300,000,000. Expenditures
from these trust funds are fixed in
permanent law. The largest of them is
the Federal old-age and survivors'
insurance trust fund which last year
paid out $5,551,000,000 and next year
will disburse $7,365,000,000. These
funds require constant replenishment,
which requires additional tax bites of
various sorts.

REAL COST

We are simply lulling ourselves to
sleep when we say: "After all, most
of what we spend is for the military.
We can't retrench much on nonmilitary
items." The point is that the non-
military items, when we include the
trust funds, amount to $33,450,000,000
while the military expenditures, including
"collective security," will cost
$45,300,000,000. There is also an interest
charge of $7,400,000,000.

The addition of these trust funds to
the requests for new appropriations,
plus spending from holdover appropriations
will mean in fiscal 1958 an
outpouring of $96,000,000,000 of Federal
money. The real tax bite will be
$99,000,000,000. This is roughly a
quarter of the gross national product.
This share, the President apparently
believes to be "prudent." But the taxpayer
is subject to bites from state and local
governments and private deductions for
various insurances and assurances.

This leaves the taxpayer with a
seriously limited amount to spend as he
chooses, and that amount is really what
keeps the economy going.

The President's optimism extends to
his estimate of revenues. This is frankly
admitted by the Budget Director to be
based on "not only continuing but increased
prosperity."

But a small drop in a corporation's or
an individual's income will cause a
disproportionate drop in the government's
revenue because of the steeply graduated
rates. In some of Mr. Truman's years the
Budget Bureau apparently overlooked this
and understated expected revenue in years
of growing business. When things drop
off, the process is reversed.

REVENUE UNCERTAIN

Thus the small surplus anticipated is
perched upon a perilous foothold of a
postal increase not yet authorized and
rising business not yet assured. If these
fail, we shall fall into deficit financing
and inflation.

These uncertainties and threats are
apparently what have so seriously disturbed
Secretary Humphrey. No doubt the
Secretary has in mind what happened in
1954, when he and Economic Adviser
Burns stood firmly in the President's inner
circle and fought off a hysterical "crash"
spending program in the face of declining
business.

At that time Humphrey and Burns
counted upon the power of public
confidence born of a tax cut and a resulting
rush of private spending. This time
Humphrey apparently stood alone and lost
the battle.

In 1953 it was the House that cut
the President's estimates by $4,000,000,000.
Let us hope that something like that will
happen again.
