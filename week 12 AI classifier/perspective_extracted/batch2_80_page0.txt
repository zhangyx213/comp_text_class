**RESTRAINT ON RIGHTS**

Wirt Yerger Jr., the highly aggres-
sive young Republican state chair-
man, is fighting this legislation. If
unsuccessful in the legislature, he will
carry the fight to the courts on con-
stitutional grounds. He points out
quite correctly that civil rights are
involved here just as seriously as de-
nials of voting rights to Negroes.
Unhappy Democrats who want to be-
come Republicans should have the
right to do so. Freezing the elector-
ate by law in a one-party system
denies the most important of the po-
litical rights of citizens. For it is small
comfort to gain the right to vote
when an entrenched party offers only
its hand-picked candidates. There
are overtones in this proposed pro-
cedure which follow the methods
that have been adopted by some of
the dictatorships abroad.
The growing strength of the Re-
publican Party in Mississippi is un-
deniable. Last November Rubel
Phillips polled 138,605 votes, or 38
per cent of the total. Phillips carried
five of the eight cities of more than
25,000. In the remaining three his
vote averaged 46 per cent. But the
building of the Republican Party
must go on in the cities, towns, and
counties. Forced back to the villages
and rural areas, the Democrats now
propose to accomplish by the force of
law what they are failing to achieve
in free elections. Negroes have their
right to demand a vote. But so do
Republicans. And citizens of both
races have an additional right—free-
dom to choose a party.
