**Perspective**

**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

**Despite the Constitution**

In a recent concurring opinion, Mr. Justice Frankfurter suggested that Marshall’s famous dictum—“the power to tax involves the power to destroy”—was “an unfortunate remark,” a “seductive cliché.” Maybe so. But cliché or no, it is being dramatically demonstrated by the discriminatory taxation which an increasing number of states are imposing upon goods produced outside of their borders.

Mr. Justice Frankfurter went on to say, by way of amplification, that he believed with Mr. Justice Holmes that “the power to tax is not the power to destroy while this Court sits.”

Well, while the Supreme Court has been sitting, the power to tax has, in fact, been used by various state legislatures to destroy competition from other states. In March 1937, for instance, the Court upheld a “use tax” imposed by the state of Washington upon materials purchased in other states. In November 1936, it upheld the right of the states to enact retaliatory measures against other states which discriminate against beer and liquor manufactured outside their borders.

And while the Court has been sitting, it might be added, the states have also been permitted to employ not only discriminatory taxes, but a score of other devices to prevent the products of other states from coming across their borders. Seven states, for example, prohibit the sale of any but fresh eggs and then proceed to define fresh eggs as eggs laid in the state. There are fruit embargoes, milk embargoes, oleomargarine embargoes—all purporting to be public-health or sanitation measures, but actually designed to serve as tariffs.

Perhaps the most extreme have been the beer and liquor embargoes. It would appear that the clear intention of the Twenty-First Amendment—to permit states to impose restrictions upon the use of intoxicants—has been interpreted by the courts as giving the states the right to protect state-produced beer and liquor from the competition of out-of-state beer and liquor. Every newspaper reader knows of the “beer war” between Michigan, Indiana and Ohio that began in 1935. The Michigan embargo on beer from Ohio is still in effect. Indiana-Ohio relations are still decidedly strained.

“All this reminds the dusty historian,” Charles A. Beard wrote two years ago, “of the good old days before the Constitution was adopted… Woodcutters on Manhattan found their firewood business at the lower end almost ruined by sharpnosed Yankees who brought wood by boat from Connecticut ports through the Sound at a lower cost of production. What to do? Nothing, except retaliate. So the sovereign State of New York levied a heavy duty on Connecticut firewood. What to do in Connecticut? The businessmen of New London held a mass meeting and unanimously resolved to suspend all business with New York.

“That was long ago, about 1786, before the Constitution was drafted.

“And among the prime purposes of the Constitution was that of preventing states, in the exercise of their rights, from cutting one another’s throats.”

We seem to be doing very nicely at throat cutting right now—while the Supreme Court sits. It’s true that, in February, the Court, speaking through Justice Frankfurter, threw out an “inspection fee” on imported cement as a circumvention of “what the commerce clause forbids.” But it still has a long way to go in plugging up the loopholes left by its decisions in 1936 and 1937.

The whole question of “interstate trade barriers” is far too pressing to wait for the slow and laborious process of judicial interpretation, however. Last week, the Council of State Governments held a conference in Chicago attended by governors, members of state legislatures and state commissioners, who came, to a considerable extent, from the states which have been among the offenders in setting up these barriers to trade (see page 52). The discussion at this conference suggests that there will be an effort to stop the piling up of restrictive measures.

One of the most provocative of the speeches made there was that of Fred I. Kent, chairman of the Commerce and Marine Commission of the American Bankers Association.

It was not until 1931-32-33, under the stress of depression, Mr. Kent pointed out, that the states generally began hunting for new methods of raising income and protecting their home markets against production in other states. Those states were following in the footsteps of the nations of Europe, which, after the war, erected trade barriers against each other so high that they were presently unable to find the exchange to meet their foreign obligations.

“It is conceivable,” Mr. Kent went on, “that if the states of the United States continue to build trade barriers against each other, a situation will arise in the United States wherein some or many states may have great difficulty in finding the dollars needed to buy from other states or to meet indebtedness incurred in other states… If interstate trade barriers existed in the United States that killed in part the natural currents of trade as they surely would, no Federal Reserve clearing system nor any other means could prevent dollars of other states—in every state—being at a premium or a discount.” “Trade wars” are the fathers of “currency wars” and, needless to say, of actual wars as well.

Fortunately, the state governors are beginning to understand the menace, now that it has been vividly presented to them.

**The ‘Come and Get It’ Policy**

B. M. Baruch is the father of the “cash and carry” policy now partially embodied in our Neutrality Act. His statement last week to the Foreign Relations Committee was lucid and persuasive. It did much to dissipate the fog left after the specious testimony of Henry Stimson the day before.

According to Baruch, a more apt name for the policy is “come and get it,” and, as he explained, when Congress tries to discriminate between implements of war and other materials, it overlooks the fact that in these days almost all things except cosmetics and French novels are materials of war.

Most important of all, Mr. Baruch, speaking on the basis of his vast practical experience, pointed out the fallacy of calling economic sanctions methods “short of war.”

“It has been suggested,” he said, “that the only way to keep out of war is now to engage in economic war” against aggressor states. “On that theory if our economic war fails we will be in military war.”

To those who believe that we might be in grave danger from the attack of European or Asiatic powers he wisely pointed out that “it is incredible that, without almost complete domination of the water and sky of both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, a military attack in truly threatening force could be launched against this hemisphere from either Europe or Asia in the face of such resistance as this and other American, if not European, nations could offer.” And, “if we believe we can defend this hemisphere, then the whole argument for now waging economic war weakens.”
