**PERSPECTIVE**

**CORPORATE GIVINGâ€”III**

**BY RAYMOND MOLEY**

The justification for and, indeed, the responsibility for corporate gifts for philanthropic purposes arise from the nature of the corporation itself and its place in the society in which it operates. Every legitimate business is itself a welfare operation. It produces goods and services to supply the needs and wants of the members of the society in which it lives. It provides work for those who operate it. It employs the savings of individuals and pays them for their use. The efficiency of its management brings more and more to more and more people. It may be that the realization of all this has been the major reason for the enlightenment that has developed in the business community in the last generation or so. In the past there have been businessmen who conceived of service as their object in life. But the wider view of public responsibility has come in modern times.

Perhaps I can make this great change in attitude clearer by citing the example of one man. In 1895 that man, who was a mechanic, established a business which he called a company. He had only his skills, his energy and a few hundred dollars of his savings. He fabricated a product that was only then coming into use. He made the product with his own hands at first, with only one employee to help. He was his own sales staff, and by his sales and collections slowly enlarged his operation, employing additional workmen. His probity and the promise of his operation won him credit at the banks. In a very few years he incorporated his company. His ingenuity was so great that he constantly improved his product and enlarged its application. And he protected his company with patents. Thus his company, in a field in which several immense competitors appeared, was able to survive.

**A SENSE OF COMMUNITY**

In a few more years the company was firmly established, profitably and well and favorably known. The intelligence of the founder had always been married to strong moral instincts. He considered the company and its external relationships. He developed what might be called a sense of community. The inner community concerned him first, and he made it possible on easy terms for employees to acquire stock interest. But he also realized that an ever-widening community had made success possible. The contributions of the company extended to the educational and charitable institutions in that expanding community.

Ultimately, on his retirement he talked about the meaning of his life and of his company. The institution he had created was not personal property. It was a product of society's evolution. He and the directors and management who succeeded him were trustees vested with a responsibility not only to stockholders, employees and customers but to society itself. A reasonable return to society, not large enough to impair the health of the company, but meaningful to the worthy institutions which were the beneficiaries, was a moral obligation. His philosophy was: "The community giveth and is given unto."

**KROPOTKIN'S 'MUTUAL AID'**

Another corporation executive has recently drawn his rationale of corporate giving into basic social theory. He cites "mutual aid" as it was developed by the great Russian scientist and philosopher Kropotkin. His contribution was a reconsideration of Darwin as he was narrowly interpreted by some who succeeded him. In all human and nonhuman life, Kropotkin demonstrated that the instinct of mutuality cut deeply into the instinct of the survival of the fittest. He showed that Darwin himself did not mean that the struggle for survival was between separate individuals for the means of existence. Darwin said: "Those communities which included the larger number of sympathetic individuals would flourish best." For raw Darwinism would leave the survivor to wither away alone, without progeny, without prey and without a purpose for existence. Most of the final chapter of Kropotkin's "Mutual Aid" suggests this application to educational, charitable and scientific associations.

The corporation itself is an example of cooperation. Its obligation to an ever-larger community expands as its operations grow beyond its place of origin.
