**Perspective**

**A Fool Employment Bill**

by RAYMOND MOLEY

Senators Wagner, Murray, O'Ma-
honey and Thomas of Utah apparently
feel that they are serving a nation of
half-wits. For their bill $380, ticketed
with the fictitious title of "full employ-
ment," is a legislative monstrosity with
the body of a wren and the head of
a parrot. The thin body is a mild
measure for gathering statistics, but
the thick head is a pretentious and
sophomoric proposal to cre-
ate a new utopia.

It is an old gag of Senator
Wagner's to preface a bill
with a bunch of rhetorical
tripe called a declaration of
policy. He knows, as a law-
yer, that this preamble has
no standing in court. But as
a politician, he knows that
such stylistic flypaper snares
votes and praise.

This present bill, the
"principle" of which Judge Vinson has
endorsed, starts with an assertion that
all Americans able to work and seek-
ing work have a right" to a job. If this
means that Congress proposes to re-
move some legal restraint on a man's
right to take any job he can get, the
gesture is unnecessary. Such a right
has always existed. But the bill does
not mean that kind of right.

The next paragraph of the pream-
ble is ridiculous enough to deserve quo-
tation in its entirety. The bill says that
"to (1) promote the general welfare
of the nation; (2) foster and protect
the American home and the American
family as the foundation of the Ameri-
can way of life; (3) raise the standard
of living of the American people; (4)
provide adequate employment oppor-
tunities for returning veterans; (5)
contribute to the full utilization of our
national resources; (6) develop trade
and commerce among the several
states and with foreign nations; (7)
preserve and strengthen competitive
private enterprise, particularly small
business enterprise; (8) strengthen the
national defense and security; and (9)
contribute to the establishment and
maintenance of lasting peace among
nations, it is essential that continuing
full employment be maintained in the
United States."

But the meat of the preamble is the
following:

"To the extent that continuing full
employment cannot otherwise be
achieved, it is the further responsibility
of the Federal government to provide
such volume of Federal investment
and expenditure as may be needed to
assure continuing full employment."

Yet the senators scramble to cover
on this tremendous pretense in the
statement made by Senator Murray
when he presented the bill. In that
statement he says that the bill carries
no estimate of "full employ-
ment." That, he adds, must
be decided each year. Then
he says that the bill does
not guarantee jobs to any in-
dividual, but that every
American shall have the as-
surance that there are jobs
to be had. Well, make up
your mind, senator!

He then says that the bill
does not provide for a
planned economy. This is
added because the term "planned
economy" is not popular. The new
term "full employment" amounts to
the same thing, however.

The body of the bill is an innocent
proposal that the President gather sta-
tistics and estimates of all private pro-
duction, purchasing power and em-
ployment for the fiscal year and
submit it to Congress as a "national
budget." Congress shall set up a joint
committee, to be composed of mem-
bers of both parties of several Senate
and House committees, to hold hear-
ings, study this material and there-
after submit recommendations to Con-
gress. Congress may then do exactly
what it chooses to do. This simple
method of studying the national eco-
nomic picture for the year is not a bad
idea. Nor is it a new one. But why
cover up a simple, harmless matter
with all the flummery and flim-flam in
the preamble? Because the party in
power, as well as Candidate Dewey,
promised "full employment" in the
1944 campaign.

There is no social or economic revo-
lution in store. But if this bill meant
what it said, a social revolution would
be necessary to accomplish it.

What I am objecting to is the
insincerity of enacting into law politi-
cal slogans which mean either nothing
or something which no one really
wants. For "full employment," literal-
ly enforced, would mean the end of
freedom for all classes of Americans.
