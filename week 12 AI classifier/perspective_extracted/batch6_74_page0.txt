Preference Means Discrimination
by Raymond Moley

Last month, Elmer L. Lindseth,
president of the Cleveland Elec-
tric Illuminating Co., appeared before
the Joint Congressional Committee on
Atomic Energy. He represented the
Edison Electric Institute of which he
is a past president and which includes
in its membership 93 per cent of the
investor-owned electric utility indus-
try. His statement was a recital of
the great progress in the
industry in planning and
constructing atomic-power
plants and a reasoned argu-
ment for the elimination of
the discriminatory prefer-
ence provisions now in the
Federal law.

Lindseth pointed out that
since the passage of the
1954 Atomic Energy Act,
which opened atomic en-
ergy for commercial purposes, the pri-
vate companies have invested $300
million in research, planning, and
development. In this, 104 companies
are participating.

There are, however, two sections in
the law which impose the threat of
injurious discriminatory treatment of
investor-owned companies in favor of
public agencies and cooperatives.
One of these imposes preference in
granting licenses, and the other in the
disposal by the AEC of surplus energy
developed in Federal plants.

This preferential treatment of pub-
lic ownership has a 50-year history.
In a reclamation act passed in 1906
it was specified that any power de-
veloped by reclamation dams which
was not needed for the irrigation
works should be sold, and that in sell-
ing that power preference should
be given to "municipal purposes."
There is much confusion as to what
these words meant. One version is
that farmers in the Salt River Valley
were afraid that the power from the
Roosevelt Dam would be gobbled up
by mining companies, and that they
wanted it specified that service to in-
dividuals should come first. Another
version is that "municipal purposes"
meant municipal street lighting and
water pumping. It seems to be clear
that the meaning was certainly not to
favor publicly owned distributing
agencies. For in those days even the
most ardent of conservationists were
not in favor of putting govern-

ment into the electric-power business.
However, the movement for mu-
nicipal ownership made such prog-
ress that in the Federal Water Power
Act of 1920 a rather ambiguous pref-
erence was given to "states and mu-
nicipalities." In the 1920s we find in
the writing of socialists such as
Stephen Rauschenbush continual agi-
tation for the governmentalization of
the power industry by the
use of "preference." This
idea found fertile soil in the
mind of Sen. George Norris,
who went almost the entire
distance in his TVA Act of
1933. In that act, coopera-
tives were included with
public bodies, and there
was also inserted provision
that when such "socially
owned" agencies needed
power it could be withdrawn from
private companies that were getting
it under contract. In an amendment
to the TVA legislation in 1935, the
Authority was given the power to buy
out existing companies in the area
and to help cooperatives and other
preference customers by lending
them money. The ultimate result was
a vast Federal monopoly.
In the Bonneville Act of 1937, a
most arbitrary provision was made
which substantially made private
companies buying power from the Co-
lumbia Valley pool temporary cus-
tomers, so far as 50 per cent of the
power generated is concerned.

Treatment of this sort, now ap-
plied to atomic energy, is a dis-
crimination against not only those
citizens and agencies which own pri-
vate companies but their customers.
Those customers are exactly the
same sort of Americans and taxpayers
as are the customers of publicly
owned power agencies and members
of cooperatives. Both pay taxes for
Federal dams and power installations
and transmission lines. But in the ad-
vantages which flow from such gov-
ernment expenditures, the person who
lives in an area served by a private
company is relegated to an inferior
status. This problem may well be a
major issue in the coming campaign
because all three of the leading Dem-
ocratic candidates are ardent expo-
nents of socialized power.
