Dewey and Roosevelt-II
by RAYMOND MOLEY

MUCH is revealed in a comparison of
the mental habits of Thomas E.
Dewey and Franklin D. Roosevelt by
the fact that the former seldom or
never uses the word "hunch" in mak-
ing decisions. Roosevelt, on the other
hand, was always talking of his
"hunches" or "brain storms."

Perhaps Roosevelt was thus casual-
ly concealing the fact that a good deal
of thinking had preceded the
"hunch." But it was a fact
that he made many of his
vital decisions on the basis
of feeling. Louis Howe was
to the day of his death fear-
ful of this quality and con-
fessed it to me among
others. Howe was also fear-
ful of the influence of people
who were in contact with
his boss. He laboriously
sought to determine and guide, if pos-
sible, "Franklin's" impulses. Howe him-
self had "brain storms," but something
was gained for governmental stability
in the fact that both men seldom had
the same hunches at the same time.
They acted as mutual correctives.

This is not to say that F.D.R. made
his decisions without consultation. He
tried out his ideas on many people.
But he carried out such consultations
largely by talking at length himself.
He rarely asked specific questions.

DEWEY'S questions dominate most
conversations, perhaps because of
his training as a trial lawyer. His habit
in seeking advice is first to put the
question, and then listen attentively
to the answer. Then he usually replies
with a devastating attack upon the
answer. The adviser then pulls himself
together and gives another and usually
better reason for his position. In mat-
ters of major concern this can go on
for two or three hours. By that time
the adviser is limp, talked out, and
sometimes convinced that he has lost
his point. Dewey may have been con-
vinced early in the proceedings. He
was merely trying to elicit his adviser's
best arguments. In the end Dewey him-
self has accumulated the best of rea-
sons for doing or not doing the matter
at issue.

This is not an unfriendly procedure,
although it often irritates people who
are not familiar with it. In fact Dewey
can take friendly or unfriendly criti-
cism in a better spirit than could
F.D.R. When you speak your mind to
Dewey you can be sure he will not
refer to you later in adverse terms.
You could not be so sure with F.D.R.
In the world of politics F.D.R. was
an artist. He probably never knew by
rational processes the reasons why he
did things. Political thinking was in his
nature. Dewey the politician is mind-
made. He figures out his
plans and actions by ra-
tional processes. If fate
had decreed that he be a
physician, a corporation
executive, a general, or a
concert singer, he would
have equipped himself in the
same way. It is likely that
he would have succeeded.

On another related point
the two men offer a sharp
contrast. When you leave Dewey you
are never in doubt about his answer to
your question or the nature of a job
which you should do for him. With
F.D.R. a passionate desire to end a
conversation with a laugh or with
agreement made his answers difficult
to fathom. Very often two or three
people thought they had an exclusive
assignment and later discovered by
running into each other that they
didn't. Repeatedly, a nod or a "yes"
intended to mean that he understood
was mistaken for agreement. This trait
plagued people who worked with
F.D.R. They were constantly inter-
rogating people who had seen the
"boss" to unravel just what had been
decided. F.D.R. just couldn't have the
heart to rebuke or to fire a subordinate.
Some tortuous compromise was de-
vised which often made more trouble.

DEWEY rates a high mark in frank-
ness; Roosevelt quite low. Gra-
ciousness of manner or a tendency to
exaggerate convinced many people that
F.D.R. did not always hew to the
strict line of accuracy. That we can
leave to history. With due allowance
for the suspiciousness of a former
prosecutor, it can be said that Dewey
wants the truth, and renders it as he
sees it.

Precision, frankness, and self-analysis
were the marks of the younger Dewey.
Experience and age have softened the
sharpness that often goes with these
qualities, but in essence they remain.
