**A MORE UNIFIED PARTY**

Up to now, I have curbed any in-
clination to speculate about a Repub-
lican candidate in 1968. I have
always said and written that so far as
a party out of power is concerned
speculation should wait until after the
mid-term election. This has been
verified many times in the past. Wil-
son, Harding, Roosevelt and Kennedy
came to the fore not before but after
the elections of 1910, 1918, 1930 and
1958. Now the Republican Party has
a wealth of potentials, and before
long the scramble will begin. During
the campaign, Richard Nixon under-
lined that fact.
Moreover, there has been projected
into the leadership of the Republican
Party such a variety of ideological
leanings that there is prospect for a
more reasonable contest for the Pres-
idential nomination in 1968. Since the
extremes have been tempered, there
is the opportunity now for a more
unified Republican Party than we
have had since 1960.
This was, as Nixon predicted, a
bad year for the "ins," and in many
places venerable reminders of the
past have been defeated and new
blood and brains have been injected
into public office. This, too, can be a
net gain for the nation.
