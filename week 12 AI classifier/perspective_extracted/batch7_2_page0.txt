**Pattern of Pacific Peace**
by Raymond Moley

SAN FRANCISCOâ€”Toward the end of
the last war it was suggested by a
number of people, including Herbert
Hoover, that it would be best to
avoid the procedure followed after
the first world war, and this time wait
six years or so before attempting to
make a final peace treaty with our
former enemies. The argument for
such a course was that a final peace
must be built upon something
more substantial than
the hatred and confusion
that remain after the battle.
For many reasons, that
course has been followed,
and six years have passed.
In those years vast forces,
generated only in part by
the designs of any individual,
have brought about a
complete reorientation of
our concept of our national interests in
the Pacific. Perhaps I ought to say re-
reorientation, because in fact the new
concept is based on American foreign
policy as it was carried out by two
of our greatest Secretaries of State,
Seward and Blaine. That policy con-
ceived our power as primarily naval
and our interests in the Pacific as
extending to a great perimeter, from
Alaska, along the shores of the Asiatic
continent to the South Seas. Essential
to that line was a friendly and cooper-
ative Japan, bound to us by close ties
of trade and other mutual concerns.

BUT that necessary factor was never
established. Our relations with
China came to be regarded as para-
mount, although our attitude toward
that country was largely sentimental
and never materially significant. As
Japan emerged as a modern industrial
nation and a great power, it was
England that saw its significance
rather than our own statesmen, except
for Theodore Roosevelt. Japan was
regarded with suspicion, intensified
by troubles over immigration and land
ownership on our West Coast. Ameri-
can trade with Japan grew, but politi-
cal and military tensions appeared.
Ultimately, war came, and by a
strangely ironical turn that war has
made both Japan and the United
States see what they failed to realize
in peace.
They now realize the natural inter-
dependence of the two powers in the
Pacific. Japan is as essential to our
interests and safety in the Pacific as is
Britain in the Atlantic. In both areas
our effective military power is on the
sea and in the air. We can never
compete on the great land mass of
Asia. And we can do little to influence
the destiny of China. What may be
happening in Asia is the rise of China
as a great military power. Napoleon,
I believe, said that "China
is a sleeping giant. Woe
betide him who awakes
her." The giant is moving,
no one knows where.

But we do know what to
do about Japan, and this
treaty signalizes the dawn of
that knowledge. It is quite
apparent that the Soviet
knows what Japan means to
us and to the non-Communist
world, and that is why it is staging
this struggle either to bring Japan
into the Communist orbit or to frus-
trate our efforts to establish Japan as
a bastion of non-Communist strength.
Russia can never dominate the Pacific
so long as Japan is strong and allied
with the Western powers. John Foster
Dulles made the pertinent statement
in NEWSWEEK last week that he al-
ways has believed that the Soviet
inspired the attack in Korea because
it is determined to get control of
Japan. Dulles offers as proof the fact
that ever since the Russians lost the
war with Japan in 1905 their historians
and strategists have argued that Rus-
sia must get a foothold in Korea in
order to be in a position to strike at
the industry and shipping of Japan.
We must not only frustrate this as a
negative policy, but affirmatively es-
tablish Japan as a permanent barrier
to such Communist ambitions.

MY CONVERSATIONS with the Japa-
nese here confirm the opinion
that we need not fear that an inde-
pendent Japan will veer to Commu-
nism. Of all the Asiatic people, the
Japanese have turned most positively
to the Western, non-Communist world.
Their ambitions, interests, and sym-
pathies are with us in the long pull
ahead. Except for some essential
trade, their destiny is even away from
China. We can, if we will, now com-
plete the task started by Secretary
Seward 80-odd years ago.
