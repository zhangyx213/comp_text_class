**The Kishi Mission**

by Raymond Moley

YEARS from now, men may look back and say of the 1960s: "There was a decade!" It can bring abundant hope, immense challenges, and fine fulfillment. Or it can be darkened by wistful regret. In foreign affairs it will be inaugurated this coming week when Japan's Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi visits Washington to consummate a new security treaty.  Our interest will swing for the time to the far reaches of the Pacific.

This treaty, bringing Japan ever more firmly into the defense cordon facing Communism, is not a stricture imposed by an occupation. It is the result of mutual effort and agreement by Japan and the United States. To a degree, the free world's position in Asia depends upon it.

Standing above others in bringing about the creation of the treaty is Kishi. During the past nine months he has managed to make himself the master of the situation within his own Liberal Democratic Party, to rally public opinion behind him, and thereby to make ineffective Socialist-Communist efforts to make the security treaty a divisive issue.

Kishi has survived heavy cross fire from the Socialist opposition. The decisive victory by the Liberal Democrats in the elections in April and June widened a serious political rift in the Socialist Party itself. And as the violence of the extreme left has grown, the effectiveness of the Socialists has lessened.

**PRACTICAL COOPERATION**

My editorial assistant, Raymond Moley Jr., who spent two years in Japan and Korea and who recently has had the benefit of the views of responsible Japanese leaders, summarizes their views in this way:

"Until recently the Japanese people regarded Kishi's opinions on defense with deep trepidation, wary of any national military force to the extreme point of allowing the home islands to become defenseless. They now share his views. Responsible Japanese realize that across the Yellow Sea, the narrow waters of La Perouse Strait, and the Sea of Japan crouches a virulent Communism. Japan has feared Chinese imperialism ever since Genghis Khan's attempted invasion in the thirteenth century, but now they realize that this is compounded with Communism which they despise. Thus Red China is the mortal enemy of the concepts which Japan has embraced ferventlyâ€”constitutional democracy, economic liberty, and close relations with the United States.

"Beyond the treaty, Kishi maintains that there must be practical cooperation with the United States in Southeast Asia, arrangements which will make the security pact secure. Unquestionably Kishi will advocate in Washington his conviction that there should be Japanese-American economic development in non-Communist Asia."

**A LONG-RANGE POLICY**

Since the rise of Red China, many Americans feared that the mainland offered the only great natural market for Japan and that inevitably relations with Peking would permit the virus of Communism to creep into the vitals of Japanese life. A thriving and healthy Japan has resisted this peril. Today the United States is Japan's best customer. Japan is our third best buyer, after Britain and Canada. Japan has achieved the miracle of realizing a favorable balance of trade with us in recent months.

Kishi's long-range policy focuses on Southeast Asia, especially Indonesia. Already Japan has done a great deal there, where they must discharge from $2 billion to $3 billion over twenty years in war reparations. President Sukarno and Kishi are good personal friends and share the wish to bring together Japan's industrial capability and the archipelago's fabulous resources, third only to those of the United States and Soviet Russia. Indonesians have set a first priority for such development. The Japanese believe that the best course for Indonesians is to emulate the Japanese during their Meiji era, to accept foreign technicians, with advice from abroad in building their economy.

Kishi feels that participation in such economic development is imperative. And he will stress this in his visit to Washington. He will speak with authority, for he has a support at home as great as that of any Japanese administration since the Pacific war.
