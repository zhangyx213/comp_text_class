**PERSPECTIVE**

**STATE-LOCAL FINANCES**

BY RAYMOND MOLEY

Despite the imaginative projections of President Johnson and the huge new programs which Congress has enacted for him, there is a limit at which Federal spending must stop. For excessive deficit borrowing weakens the dollar. And when the dollar is weakened, international considerations confront us with a deadly fiscal peril. These new programs and the immortal old ones designed to help meet state and local needs only partially meet the demands on the domestic front. They will not abolish poverty, nor relieve urban congestion, nor solve any of the other great needs of our growing urban society. The greater load is still on the states and communities, and their agonies in trying to get the necessary money are piteous to view.

There are many estimates of what states and local governments need and will need. These estimates vary according to the years selected for comparisons. One estimate says that state-local spending will reach $142 billion by 1976—twice the figure for 1963. This is a per capita increase of nearly 80 per cent. Another estimate says that since World War II the cost of local government has been climbing at the rate of 8 per cent compounded. From less than $8 billion in 1946, it has already climbed to more than $46 billion, and at this rate it will reach $70 billion in 1970 and $108 billion by 1975.

**RICHEST SOURCE OF MONEY**

This latter calculation omits climbing state expenditures, a considerable part of which must go to help local governments. That figure was $11.9 billion in 1963, up from $5.4 billion in 1954.

To meet these rising costs, states as well as urban communities are, according to the Tax Foundation, contemplating many forms of new taxes and also increases in old ones. A general sales tax is the favorite way of getting new revenue in both cities and states. At the present time one-fourth of all state revenues come from sales taxes. In nine of the thirteen states without such a tax there is strong probability that it will be adopted. Other methods of getting new revenue under consideration are taxes on tobacco, alcoholic beverages, motor fuel, personal income, and corporation income taxes.

But all these would only add $3 billion to state revenues. And it is impossible to estimate what cities may raise by their own new forms of taxes.

Prof. C. Lowell Harriss, consultant for the Tax Foundation, after reviewing all these efforts to stimulate the flow of revenue, concludes that the major opportunity of meeting the needs for new revenue is to improve the operation of the oldest of them all—the property tax. It is, he says, not only the most promising form of urban relief but in its administration the most defective. It still remains the richest source of revenue. The base of this tax is estimated to be worth $1.8 trillion. The problem is to remove its inequities and improve its administration.

**TAXATION CAUSES SPRAWL**

Not only does the present property tax yield less revenue than it could yield, but the inequitable impact of the tax horribly distorts the shape and appearance of the city and its environs.

Unsightly slums are cheek to cheek with blocks of beautifully designed buildings. For a slum investment virtually escapes taxation and promises rich profits when sold.

There is also the suburban “sprawl,” where idle areas of land are scattered among many home developments. This means that workers who live in the suburbs or exurbs must use their automobiles to and from work. And to accommodate this traffic, monstrous highways are erected which literally destroy large sections of a city, mostly the downtown areas.

The basic purpose of cities has been defined as a means “to overcome the handicaps of distance and maximize the ease of business and social contacts.” This is frustrated by sprawl.

These distortions are mostly the results of bad taxation and assessments. The cost of these distortions is enormous, because improvements such as water, sewerage, highways, and gas, telephone, and electric lines must extend longer distances. As a result, the citizen’s expenses are greatly increased.
