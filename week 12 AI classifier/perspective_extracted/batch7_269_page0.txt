**Private Socialism**

**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

CHICAGO—Twelve years ago, in this city, I spoke before the Commercial Club on the subject “Private Socialism.” The term referred to the great power, once exercised by the business community over economic and political life, which at times assumed practically monopolistic control. And since socialism is monopoly, this private power was, in effect, private socialism. I have just spoken before the same group on the same subject. Private socialism, however, is now exercised by a handful of labor leaders.

It must be written down, however sadly, that the President and the Administration of which he is head have demonstrated the weakest performance that this country has witnessed in almost 100 years. Consider the Truman record in the railroad crisis. A “model” railway labor act has been on the books for several years. It looked like a good law and, if permitted to operate as intended, it would have been a good law for the present controversy. But the government chose to interfere with its operation. And that is the root of the trouble, as, in fact, such interference has been the root of all labor trouble since the end of the war.

I have reliable information that the fact-finding board first decided on a 10-cent increase for the railroad workers. The Administration entered the picture, and the offer was increased to 16 cents. Thereupon the union leaders were emboldened to believe and assume that the President, and not the board, was the final arbiter. So they decided to put the heat on him. They refused to accept 16 cents. The President’s behavior under this pressure has not been pleasant to contemplate. There was backing and filling as the first announced date for the strike was fixed. Finally, minutes before the deadline, the two recalcitrant union leaders told the President that the strike would be moved ahead five days. This information was carried to the country. The President, it should be noted, was merely the announcer of the decision. The union men refused to move until official word came from their own union heads. Finally, they received that word and obeyed.

This refusal of the men to act on the word of the President of the United States is a matter of deadly seriousness. It is a symptom of something that has been happening in the United States which goes to the root “of good faith and of trust in government. The President was not issuing an order. He was announcing a decision made by the men who had the authority to make it. Nevertheless, he was ignored.

President Truman is the prisoner of a situation which has been in the making for a long time. In 1941, before Pearl Harbor, there was a rail wage dispute. Wayne L. Morse, now Senator from Oregon, was chairman of the mediation board then. After the Morse board had handed in its report, President Roosevelt took over negotiations and, after four failures to effect a settlement, decided to throw the matter back into the hands of the board. The board settled the dispute.

But a precedent was established which is now yielding bitter fruit. A regularly constituted agent of the government had been stultified, and while the law was still called a good law, the unions knew that it could be made into a sham. They knew, and the government should have known that political power would thereafter be the arbiter. And so there was encouraged still more the trend toward settling economic disputes through the mobilization of political power.

Whatever the outcome of the present discontent may be, one thing is certain: Congress must by law regularize the political activities of labor unions, put them on a par with other political groups and make them truly responsible. Moreover, the national government must stop negotiating with the parties to a labor dispute, except to serve as a means of bringing the parties together. There is no real collective bargaining when the power of government enters the game as a bargainer, using as its stakes other people’s money.

Further, there can be no economic freedom as long as government can be used as the tool for any form of private socialism. Labor, as well as business, must be subject to the rules of free competition. A nation cannot stand which is half free and half monopolistic.
