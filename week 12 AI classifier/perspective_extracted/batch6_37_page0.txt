**The Code and the Church**

*by Raymond Moley*

Two events, of serious concern to the motion-picture industry and the American public, came into the news in the final weeks of 1956. There was a revision of the Production Code of the Motion Picture Association of America, formerly generally known as the Hays' Office. Shortly after that Francis Cardinal Spellman, speaking with his great authority as Archbishop of New York and a prince of the church, publicly denounced a motion picture, "Baby Doll"â€”a picture which had been approved by the code administrators. The two events were not directly connected but the cardinal's proscription served grim notice upon the motion-picture industry and the MPAA that the Roman Catholic Church will not abandon its responsibility to protect its people from what it considers harmful entertainment.

Indeed, the Catholic Church has had a vital part in the 35 years' revolution which transformed a rowdy and tasteless film world into an orderly, self-regulated industry. Back in those days one of movies' pioneers commented that "this is no business, it's a dissipation."


**CODE ORIGINS**

The states were rapidly adopting censorship to clear up the mess when a group of movie makers in 1921 invited Will H. Hays to save them from political regulation. With infinite patience, good sense, and plenty of political shrewdness Hays rescued them from political censorship. But there remained the job of saving them from themselves. This needed outside pressure, much of which came from the Catholic Church. In 1930 a code of decency and propriety was written by Father Daniel I. Lord and Martin Quigley, a Catholic and a publisher in the motion-picture field. Hays succeeded in getting the industry to adopt the code in 1930.

During the four years that followed, however, the code had little more validity than most New Years' resolutions. With business falling off, more and more dirt was added to the pictures. Finally, a number of Catholic bishops mobilized the power of the church. Organized boycotts were instituted, the Legion of Decency was established and other religious denominations joined the crusade. A badly frightened industry then permitted Hays to set up a strong means of enforcing the code under Joseph I. Breen. The industry found Breen to be tough but fair and before long it came to realize that self-regulation was the only alternative to ruin. For with the coming of sound and of elaborate artistic embellishments, the imposition of the capricious orders of many state boards of censorship would have been intolerable. The modern motion picture, if it is to be regulated at all, must be checked at every step from script to the finished product. Moreover, the laws and police regulations against indecent and otherwise objectionable entertainment cannot effectively be applied to motion pictures.


**STRENGTHENED**

According to Martin Quigley, who not only participated in writing the original code but in the recent revision, the changes have not altered the essential moral prohibitions but have added "several new and important provisions." His judgment is that the code has been strengthened and that the acceptance of the changes is a tribute to the people in the industry. Certain subjects formerly banned may now be treated with good taste but others omitted from the original code are now prohibited. Among these are blasphemy, mercy killing, and detailed physical violence.

Some "artistic" souls bewail any restraints upon those who produce public entertainment. They speak loosely of perfect liberty. But liberty as distinguished from freedom implies orderly limitations. And in truth those limitations are what compel the artist to his utmost efforts. The limitations of the code have in countless instances brought out the best in producers, directors, and actors. "Tea and Sympathy" as a Broadway play was grossly impaired by cutting corners with smutty words and insinuations. As a motion picture it was delicate and moving, with strong moral implications. The movie people can do a fine job. But like all human beings they "want watching." Cardinal Spellman calls attention to the fact that there is need to watch the watchers.
