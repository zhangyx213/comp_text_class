**Perspective**

God must have liked the little
businessmen because he made so many of
them. And in this respect, at least, the
politicians are on the side of God. They
are apt to deal fondly with the small fel-
lows because there are so many of them.
That is what makes it interesting and,
perhaps, not unprofitable to wonder what
Mr. Roosevelt's feelings will be when he
sits down and meditates on his "small
business" conference. After he dismisses
thoughts of the pleasantries of the occa-
sion and begins to analyze the complaints
and demands of his visitors, will he mur-
mur: "Et tu, Brute," or will he simply
brood in bewildered silence?
Familiarity with the vast literature on
the yearnings of the small businessman,
merchant and manufacturer might have
reduced the element of surprise in the
President's feelings, at any rate. As recent-
ly as last week, John W. Love, an in-
formed business commentator for the
Scripps-Howard papers, confirmed the im-
pression of those acquainted with the gen-
eral tenor of these yearnings by sampling
opinion in Cleveland.
He reports that the most articulate of
the small businessmen want competition
preserved by government action which
keeps prices up, and not by government
action which forces prices down.
They want the manufacturer and big
merchandiser to maintain his price, and
not to cut it, as Robert H. Jackson and
President Roosevelt have been suggesting.
They are against mass distribution
which permits price cutting, rather than
against mass production which Mr.
Roosevelt urges to cut prices.
They attack "monopoly" because they
want mass distributors to maintain prices.
Mr. Roosevelt attacks "monopoly" be-
cause he wants mass producers to cut
prices.
All of this does not mean, of course,
that the small businessmen and the Presi-
dent are on opposite sides of the fence.
It simply takes note of the fact that
"monopoly" means one kind of heinous
monster to the President, and another to
the small businessman.
Now an agile and ingenious mind might
attempt to rationalize away this incon-
gruity by saying that, when the President
spoke of price cuts by producers last
week, he implied that such cuts would be
passed on to the consumer by distributors.
But this formula would still not take ac-
count of the little fellow's concern over


cuts originating on the distribution side.
Only regulation of the Robinson-Patman
variety (which, remember, forbids the
manufacturer to sell to one class of busi-
ness for less than he sells to another un-
less he can prove the saving between the
types of trade) will satisfy the little fel-
low.
And this brings the fundamental con-
flict of purposes out into the open. For
while the small merchant is incensed at
the failure of the Administration to swing
the Robinson-Patman ax with enthusiasm
and vigor, the Administration is convinced
that the Act will either have to be
amended or repealed. While the small
businessman favors the Miller-Tydings
legislation (which protects commerce
within those states that have fair-trade
acts from the interstate competition of
concerns that disregard those acts), it is
a matter of record that the President
signed that legislation "under protest."
And while there is a raft of similar legis-
lation pending in Congress whose passage
the little fellows insist is indispensable if
they are not to be driven out of business,
it is obvious that none of it is apt to re-
ceive the Presidential blessing.
I suspect that the demand for such
legislation will return to plague Mr.
Roosevelt long after he has forgotten
why he staged the amiable meetings of
the past month. And I suspect, too, that
when he suddenly realizes that he and
the small businessman are talking about
totally different things he will decide that
there is nothing the country needs so
much as a good twenty-five-cent diction-
ary on his desk.

ment was that the way to conquer the
immediate difficulty the country faces is
to cut prices now and hold wage rates at
their present level.
Such a policy—the sudden, sharp, en-
forced reduction of prices and the mainte-
nance of rigid labor costs, interest charges
and tax rates—can succeed only in de-
creasing employment and drying up pur-
chasing power. If hourly wage rates and
all other items except prices remain fixed
in the corporate budget, the manufacturer
can do nothing except discharge some of
his employees or spread the work among
them. In either case, total purchasing
power is reduced.
There is only one way to do in a few
days, weeks or months what Mr. Roose-
velt’s statement implies he wants to do.
The statesman who will not wait for
technological progress must resort to in-
flation to reduce the real cost of pro-
duction.
But when he does, he will actually be
reducing the real value of wages and
interest payments. The dollar the wage
earner and bondholder get will simply be
worth less. And the entire process will
leave the statesman not where he was
when he started, but a good deal further
away from recovery, for he will then have
on his hands a badly short-circuited in-
dustrial and financial machine.
There has been a phenomenal increase
in the wage rates of 1929-1937 in manu-
facturing industries as compared with the
wage rates of 1923-1929. This refers not
only to the jump in terms of dollars but
to the jump in terms of the purchasing
power of those dollars. The prices of the
goods the consumer buys have, on the
whole, decreased. Indicative of this tend-
ency are the figures recently compiled by
Sears, Roebuck which show the contribu-
tion to the improvement of the workers’
lot. American industry has made in fifteen
years. Men and women with small incomes
find, in buying shoes, clothing and home
furnishings, that their 1937 dollar went
further than did their 1923 dollar. Prac-
An alarm clock with a resounding
tick might be helpful, too, as a reminder
that timing is one of the elements of
statesmanship.
Last week the President stated, at the
same moment that he advocated price re-
ductions, that he opposed reductions in
hourly wage rates.
This statement, if it were meant to
describe a desirable trend over a period of
years, would be wholly defensible. Most
progressive economists and enlightened
businessmen agree that, over the years, as
technological progress reduces costs, prices
ought to decline and wages increase: both
labor and the consumer ought to share the
benefits of increased volume and efficiency.
But that is certainly not what Mr. Roose-
velt said. The import of his pronounce-

When we hear White House pronounce-
ments these days we are prompted to ask
with Rastus who had just been sentenced
to hang in August: “Your Honor don’t
mean this comin’ August, does you?”
