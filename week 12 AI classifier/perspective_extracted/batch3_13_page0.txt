**A Party United**

by Raymond Moley

THE Republican convention ended
in a peace which truly passes all
understanding. No one could have expected
such harmony. There are few precedents
in history. Even in 1860 Governor
Seward, who had the prize snatched from
him despite his big advantage, left Chicago
believing that his party had nominated an
uncouth prairie lawyer. For two months
after the convention in 1952, gloom and
resentment prevailed among Taft supporters.
Sometimes suspicion of foul play mars unity;
at other times, a knowledge of smelly deals.

There were no deals this time, only
reasonable accommodations. From the time
when the Democrats selected Johnson for
Vice President, Lodge became almost a
certainty. Nixon knew that the impairment
of his chances in Texas and the South meant
urgent efforts to gain strength in the Northeast.
Deepening international tensions called for a
Vice President who could help cope with
them, and the need for harmony in New York
demanded an entente with Rockefeller. In that
agreement, neither gave away anything of
substance. In the test, Nixon's sagacity proved
itself.

**GOLDWATER'S REMINDER**

After President Eisenhower's remarkable
reading of his record—in the finest speech of
his career—no Republican need hesitate to
stand on that record. There was also the appeal
to moral values by the venerable dean of the
party, Herbert Hoover. Governor Rockefeller
came girt in the loincloth of an irreconcilable
John the Baptist, and left in the bright livery of
regularity. This year Adlai Stevenson's figure
of the two-headed elephant will fade. Also
notable was Charles Percy's unremitting effort
to create a platform. It is a meaningful
statement, although it is too long and will be
soon forgotten.

There is vastly greater appreciation now of
Sen. Barry Goldwater's stature as a leader and
exponent of a clear public philosophy. This is
exceedingly important because a very large
element in the Republican Party believes as he
does, and without its active and enthusiastic
support the party could not win. Goldwater's
principles call for growth and progress without
excesses and without the impairment of local and
state responsibility.

Goldwater's unquestioned leadership of
conservative Republicans enabled him to remind
his party and all of us of the facts of life in a
two-party nation. With such a system—and it is
indispensable to our liberty in so great and
diversified a country—there can be no precise
agreement within a party in all details. No
candidate can completely satisfy everyone, if he
is candid enough and courageous enough to
speak his mind. Tolerance of the views of
others, accommodation in details is inevitable.
To sulk and refrain from participation is to lose all
while clinging to some.

**FORMIDABLE TEAM**

A year ago on this page, under the caption "All
or Nothing," I stressed that lesson to conservatives.
Again, six weeks ago, I said the same under the
title "The Irreconcilables." On both occasions,
the first letter I received was a note of agreement
from Goldwater. The views he so pointedly
expressed to conservatives in his final speech at
the convention have always been his firm
convictions.

It has repeatedly been said that the Arizona
senator is emerging as the successor and heir of
the late Senator Taft. There is much to commend
that view. Both have been strong constitutionalists;
both believers in progress through a free economy.
Taft excelled in legal debate. Goldwater is more
articulate, more precise, with more emotional
appeal. He also has a powerful appeal to young
men and women, among whom there is a growing
conservative tide, especially among college students.

In the campaign now beginning, Goldwater
will be a major factor. Since the Democrats have
decided to make a major issue of defense, he will
speak on that with authority. Thus, the Republican
ticket has at its service a formidable team. There
are the two principals, Nixon and Lodge, veterans
of many a campaign, Goldwater, and the attractive
and likable Rockefeller. And, very important,
President Eisenhower, determined with deep sincerity
that his Administration shall win a vote of confidence
in November.
