**The Man and the Party**

by Raymond Moley

MY FIRST choice of a title for this,
my semifinal preelection piece,
was "To the Independent Voter." But
I have never seen a genuine independ-
ent, and if I did so I would not like
him. The stigmata of such a person
would be a repellent isolation of mind
and selfishness of the spirit. He would
be a thoroughly uncivilized creature.
For civilization is a sharing of inter-
ests. It is loyalty, cooperation,
and interdependence.
But I have met people
who call themselves political
independents and they are
admirable people. They are
the product of a basic up-
heaval in our party system
and a bitter but not irrecon-
cilable division in the Re-
publican Party. I want to
address a few words to
them. Typical of them is a man in Chi-
cago who told me that he found it hard
to take Dewey. Typical also are peo-
ple in New York who don't like Taft.
Ike wants both kinds of Republi-
cans, not only because he wants to
win, but because he knows what a
vital, responsible, two-party system
means to the future of liberty in
America. It is amazing how clearly
Eisenhower has grasped this great po-
litical principle. Perhaps he learned
in Europe how, when responsible
party government dissolved, the domi-
nant single party became a ruthless
dictatorship. He saw England, with
responsible parties, stand firm beside
the chaos of a continent. His roots,
moreover, are deep in America and he
knows that it was no mere coincidence
that liberty and union grew with party
government and that bloody civil war
came when the parties broke up in
the '50s and the extremists and non-
compromisers took over.
This summer I talked at length
with Eisenhower and I know that he
is seeing this problem with the wis-
dom of a statesman. He knows that if
he loses because he is deserted by
those who will not compromise, the
Republican Party will dissolve in dis-
sident fragments, perhaps for our life-
time. On the other hand, a hard core
of control will dominate the Demo-
cratic Executive, in which minorities
will take over. The traditional Demo-
cratic Party will dissolve, too, and we
shall once more, as was the case in the


years between Jackson and Lincoln,
be ruled by a machine of Federal
officeholders and beneficiaries of Fed-
eral patronage.
If Eisenhower wins, the sharpness
of the differences between the ex-
tremists in the Midwest and the irre-
concilables in the East will fade out.
This will happen in part because
Eisenhower demonstrated in Europe
a capacity to harmonize
dissident elements.
But more important, those
senators and others who
have been most fierce on
the offensive will lose the
incentive of attack. Party
government is very much
like modern football. It de-
velops distinctive defensive
and offensive players. When
Eisenhower is President
there will emerge a different group
of constructive senators and congress-
men. The function of attack will then
go to the Democratic side.
Finally, if Eisenhower wins, he will
be able to construct a two-party sys-
tem in the South, something that has
not existed for three-quarters of a
century. At long last, a truly national
Republican Party will emerge in all
48 states, dedicated to the constitu-
tional principle of limited Executive
power, strong states in a sound union,
political and economic liberty, and
progress through individual freedom
and opportunity.
This is the choice. On one hand is a
Federal machine, dominant for years,
with an opposition fragmentary and
discordant from which may rise a ruth-
less tyranny of the right. On the other,
the American way of two responsible,
nationwide parties.

**The Vote Is The Pay-off**

When this appears there will be
twelve days before election. Registra-
tion will still be going on in nine states.
This election will be decided not by
what the candidates do, but what mil-
lions of Americans do in getting out
the vote.
Your job is not complete when you
vote. Your duty is to get out other
votes. For material on get-out-the-
vote, write or wire to The American
Heritage Foundation, 25 West 45
Street, New York 36, New York.
