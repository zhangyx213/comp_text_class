**What's in the GNP?**

by Raymond Moley

IN THE campaign of 1960 the rate of national growth as measured by a statistic called the gross national product was an issue. One party said its growth had not been big enough. The other said it had. But few questioned whether the GNP constitutes a genuine measure either of national growth or of national wealth. If not, all arguments about relative percentages are meaningless.

Quite a number of economists have questioned the accuracy of the government's method of determining the GNP for a long time. They have questioned the validity of the factors which are included in the figure. They have been told by government statisticians that even if some of those components are guesses they are constant from year to year and provide a comparative rate of increase. But since some of those merely estimated components vary from year to year any comparison is unrealistic.

**MISSING FACTORS**

Dr. Julius Hirsch is an economist whom I have respected for a long time. He is thoroughly familiar with the government's means of compiling data here just as he was in Germany while he was economic chief of the German Republic in the 1920s. In the Truman Administration he used to supply me with his own estimates of Federal revenues and expenditures every year. They were at considerable variance with those stated in President Truman's Budget Messages. Invariably, the Hirsch estimates proved to be the more correct. His criticism now of the government's methods of arriving at the figure for the GNP is a challenge to a statistic before which so many pay most profound attention.

He points out that the GNP fails to account adequately for at least four important components:

1-The government's estimate of new building construction is a gross understatement. The government places great reliance upon the dollars involved in building permits. But there are many places where building permits are not required. There are great sums expended in improvements and reconstruction which are not recorded by any government agency. In a long statement by the Federal Statistics Users Conference this appears: "Construction activity statistics are composed of measures, estimates, and judgments. On the whole there have been all too few measures and all too many estimates and judgments."

That statement goes on to say that maintenance and repair, additions and alteration constitute a huge area involving probably $20 billion a year. This, it says, "is the most inadequately reported portion of construction activity. The figure used is only an estimate published some months after the year reported on."

2-Dr. Hirsch notes also the great growth of do-it-yourself construction of many kinds. This, as anyone knows, has risen greatly because of the excessive cost of labor and the scarcity of competent help. This applies not only to what the owner does to improve his own home and the facilities therein. It also applies to cooperative community activity. It should be said that certain government agencies are awakening to the importance of this source of wealth but nothing of importance has been done to ascertain its value.

3-Dr. Hirsch states also that since the GNP is merely a record of values in dollars nothing is done adequately to take account of it. A few weeks ago I had an article on this page showing that motor-vehicle tires had improved immensely in quality in the past 30 years with little or no increase in cost. In Britain there has been a running controversy between the political parties concerning the rate of growth. Anthony Crosland, a more conservative Labor Party member, has made the point against his own colleagues that there could be great national progress and increasing national wealth with no monetary increase in the GNP at all.

4-Finally, Dr. Hirsch notes the vast sums which are involved in unreported incomes.

So far as comparisons with Russia are concerned, it should be noted that even Khrushchev is admitting that many of his managers have been exaggerating their figures. Heads are rolling for that. This is a clear indication that Russian figures of production are meaningless.
