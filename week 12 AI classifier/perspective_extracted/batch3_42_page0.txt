**Revolution in Dallas**

by Raymond Moley

THE United States House of Representatives is a large complex of committees and subcommittees whose labors, generally thorough and sincere, are shrouded from public sight and lost to public interest. Seniority is sovereign. Power is exercised by the hoary veterans of 30 years of Democratic control, broken only twice. Young members are admonished, in the crisp aphorism of that Nestor of them all, Sam Rayburn, that "the way to get along is to go along." The House is no forum for forensic prowess; minority reports are buried in thick books, and only in "extensions" in the appendix of the Congressional Record may the green shoots of statesmanship have a partial say. But among these young members are many who will ultimately reach high office. This is especially true of young Republicans, who can only work and wait. They are the hope of a revived Republicanism.

Notable among them is Bruce Alger of Dallas. He appeared in politics in 1954 as a candidate for a seat held for time immemorial by Democrats and distinguished for many years by Hatton Sumners, sagacious, learned statesman who found his inspiration in the word of God, in the Constitution, and, like St. Francis, in the language of birds during his early morning walks. Dallas has preferred such conservatives. But to break its allegiance to the Democratic Party required something most unusual.

**UNREVISED REPUBLICAN**

The Alger campaign offered just that unusual inducement. For it provided a very attractive candidate and a strong volunteer organization. Alger never emasculated his Republicanism with such qualifying adjectives as "modern" or "progressive" or "liberal." Dallas liked that. He was a successful businessman. Dallas is notable for its young, self-made businessmen. Alger had also made a name for himself in civic affairs unrelated to politics. But his cause had to be brought to the attention of voters by an organization suited to the candidate and his principles. The germ of this organization had been created in the Eisenhower campaign in 1952. It was developed in behalf of Alger in 1954.

It was headed and directed by able young business executives who mobilized vigorous volunteer workers in considerable numbers. A "Couples Canvass" was carried on by men and women volunteers from house to house. There was a "Yard Sign" drive to put the Alger name wherever the property owners permitted it. Then there was a "Bruce Alger Day," when 90 attractive and colorfully garbed young women invaded downtown Dallas attaching campaign tags to good-natured citizens. Now there is a full-time organization headquarters to keep interest in Alger and his policies before the voters between elections.

**TOIL, SWEAT, VOLUNTEERS**

In 1954, despite a nationwide Democratic tide, Alger won with 28,000 votes and a 3,000 margin. He repeated in 1956. In 1958, despite another Democratic trend, he doubled his 1954 vote and majority. In Congress Alger has supported economy, sound money, and freedom of enterprise. He has voted to keep government out of business activities which would best be left to private efforts. Even on measures which would provide Federal money for Dallas, he has braved the "let's-get-our-slice" people at home and has voted to protect the national interest. There is a profoundly important lesson in the Dallas revolution for many other urban, suburban, and sub-suburban communities. There is where the destiny of the Republican Party must be determined. While the farm population is slipping away, the greatest growth in the population is in the newly opened areas in the suburbs and in the areas beyond the suburbs. There, living side by side, owning their homes, and running their common community affairs are junior executives, well-paid industrial workers, tradesmen, retired people, and others. These people have a vital community of interest in less wasteful government, better schools supported and controlled locally, and economic freedom. The political allegiances of these people are not yet ingrained. They will support candidates and a party which consider their interests. They hold the balance of national power. But they must be organized.
