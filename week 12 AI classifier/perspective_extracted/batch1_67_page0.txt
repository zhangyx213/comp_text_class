**AUTOMOTIVE SAFETY—IV**

**BY RAYMOND MOLEY**

Some years ago residents of and visitors to the state of Connecticut came to realize that there was a governor there who was determined to take vigorous action to reduce the high rate of motor-vehicle accidents.  Among the measures he adopted were drastic policing, road improvements, public education and warnings to drivers by signs and other methods. After the initiation of Governor Ribicoff’s “crusade”—his word—I was one of those who noted vast improvement in the behavior of drivers. There has been substantial statistical evidence of this change, for Connecticut has less than a third of the number of serious accidents that afflict a state such as Nevada.

For a time Ribicoff was chairman of a governors’ committee on automotive safety. Later, as Secretary of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, he initiated many studies of the subject. Still later, as senator he continued his crusade as chairman of the subcommittee on Executive Reorganization of the Committee on Government Operations. Last year he held extensive hearings which received testimony from many agencies, government and private. He has a bill before the Senate which provides for very considerable Federal study and regulation. This bill may be supplanted soon by a Presidential message and bill which was promised in the annual message.

**TENTATIVE CONCLUSIONS**

This investigation, together with the President’s interest, makes the subject one of the most important public questions that will be faced this year. Such efforts as have been made will provide a vast amount of public education which, in itself, will have a salutary effect, I hope, upon the millions of automobile drivers and owners, government officials at all levels and also manufacturers.

A laborious examination of the testimony in those hearings, as well as material supplied by many public and private agencies interested in the subject, leads me to a number of very tentative conclusions:

1—In almost every accident there are three components: the driver or drivers, the environment outside the vehicle and the vehicle itself. By the environment I mean the roadway; the regulatory agencies, including the police; and, in some cases, the weather and terrain.

2—Of those three, the driver almost always is the major cause of accidents. The environment is next, and the vehicle is third.

3—Measures to assure more safety must be directed at all three, with most emphasis upon the first two. And here the leadership must come from government and the automotive industry.

4—Accident reporting is sketchy and varied, according to the jurisdiction in which the accident occurs. Thus, the raw data on which remedial conclusions can be reached are insufficient.

5—This lack of data greatly handicaps the many research activities that have been conducted for years by the automotive industry, the governments and various private agencies. The result is that those concerned have inadequate information upon which methods of improvement can be built.

6—In the automotive industry a great deal has been spent in money and talent, in individual companies and cooperatively, to create better and safer cars, to provide information for the guidance of many public agencies and for the purpose of education in the schools and research institutions.

7—It must be realized that the tremendous impact of the automobile on our civilization has created problems which have accumulated so fast that all those concerned have had difficulty in mastering them.

8—The pressing needs are not only for more information, study and research but, on the basis of what we now know, for more uniform and stricter tests for drivers; for more driving education, especially for the young; for inspection of all cars by public authority; for national standards in road construction and improvements and for more safety devices in new cars. Whether any or all of these should be done by the Federal government or by cooperation among the states and local governments or, in the case of car design, be left to the industry are major issues in 1966.
