**Perspective**

**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

**The Sixth Year Begins**

One politically significant product
of Washington's belated realization that
the business index is plummeting is the
horselaugh which greets the barest men-
tion of the word "planning."

A Max Eastman might delight in analyz-
ing the comic predicament of an Adminis-
tration so preoccupied with planning that
it forgot to watch whether its plans were
breaking down, an Administration which
set so much store by planning that it did
not understand its plans could go awry.
Mr. Eastman could have a grand time
pointing to the incongruity between gran-
diloquent talk of a planned economy for
the entire nation and the scandalous failure
of planning to rescue a single industry, the
bituminous-coal industry, from its third
breakdown in less than five years.

But those who seriously believe that a
modern democratic government must ac-
cept the responsibility for making our eco-
nomic machinery more stable and produc-
tive cannot but be concerned by increas-
ing public contempt for the principle of
intelligent foresight in public affairs. It will
be a calamity of major proportions if that
principle should be discredited for years
because of the Administration's inability
to make good on its cosmic promises.

The fact of the matter is that we are
not the victims of the failure of planning.
We are the victims of the failure to plan.
It is well known that the majority of out-
standing government statisticians with ac-
cess to the White House forecast a business
recession of grave proportions late last
spring; at least one of them predicted it
over a year ago. But another group of
Presidential advisers who stoutly refuse
to admit the necessity of planning at all
pooh-poohed these storm warnings and de-
fiantly launched the Administration on a
business-baiting campaign without the
slightest demurral from the President. In
short, we lack even such planning as would
involve the selection of one of two wholly
irreconcilable groups of advisers.

There is in this country a tradition of
contempt for the capabilities of govern-
ment summed up in the venerable "Least
governed, best governed." This tolerant
cynicism has grown by what it has fed
upon—the frequently demonstrated ineffi-
ciency and incompetence of local, state
and federal administrations in the past
and, now, the trust busters' insistence that
government should care, and care passion-
ately, about human betterment, but do


nothing about it except knock together the
heads of a "small, wicked minority," and
all will be well with the people.

The tragedy is that it may take years
for people to realize again that humane
purposes must be implemented by fine
thinking. The problems which are sym-
bolized by slums, sweated labor, insecure
savings and impoverished old age are not
merely the fruits of individual indifference
or selfishness, but, as H. G. Wells puts it,
the fruits of "jerry-built conclusions, hasty
purposes, aimless habits of thought..."

We shall probably have to learn all over
again that we cannot solve these problems
by more jerry-built conclusions, more hasty
purposes and more aimless habits of
thought.

The old proverb has it that the road to
hell is paved with good intentions. A con-
temporary, George Bernard Shaw, amends
it by saying that the road to hell is paved
with benevolence. That is Mr. Shaw's an-
swer to Dante's comforting half-truth, re-
cently invoked, that justice weighs the
sins of the cold-blooded and the sins of
the warm-hearted in different scales. It is
the irrefutable answer to the eternal alibi
for failure.

But how long will it take to make that
truth stick?

**A 'Hold-Your-Breath' Spell**

Certain Washington correspondents
have discerned the advent of another
"breathing spell." Another? By the cold
record of action and concrete proposals
issuing from the White House we are now
entering the sixth month of a "breathing
spell." Since mid-October, when the Presi-
dent returned from the Far West to find
a business recession on his hands, there has
been no visible change in his program.

The main points of this program were
passage of the Farm, Wage-Hour, and Ad-
ministrative Reorganization Bills, liberali-
zation of the Federal Housing Act, the
modification of the undistributed-profits
and capital-gains taxes, and a policy of
moderate economy, aimed at a balanced
budget. In addition, the President sought,
conspicuously, the advice of prominent
(and little) businessmen and industrialists.
This is still the President's program.

The President has now reassured Demo-
cratic leaders in Congress that he is not
feeling around in his hat for new rabbits.
The President would like to believe that the
program which he has outlined is enough.
But, as he intimated in his press conference

NEWSWEEK

on March 4, he still distinguishes between
"objectives" and "methods." Plainly he
still thinks he is a "quarterback."

If a convincing business upturn has be-
gun before Congress adjourns for the sum-
mer, the "breathing spell" probably will
continue. If not, be prepared for a spend-
ing program of at least moderate size. As a
politician, Mr. Roosevelt is banking on an
upswing before the November election. If
he cannot induce an upswing by his present
program, he will try something else. The
current "breathing spell" might more prop-
erly be called a "hold-your-breath spell."

**Arthur Morgan**

Whenever I happened to meet a
politician who had just returned from an
effort to get jobs or favors from Arthur
Morgan, in the early days of the New
Deal, I heard choice assortments of cuss
words. They hadn't gotten what they
wanted—which was to crash through the
bars in the Act set up against spoils. I
had never met Dr. Morgan, but I judged
that he was a strong and honest man by
the enemies he had made.

Soon the spoilsmen were joined by the
Socialists, who wanted to convert a yard-
stick into a weapon to begin the socializa-
tion of the American utilities. They had
been obstructed by a man who believed
that what Congress had designated as a
yardstick should be a yardstick and no
more. And so they cussed him and joined
the spoilsmen in wanting him out.

Harcourt Morgan and Lilienthal say
Arthur Morgan is no "sportsman." Appar-
ently he isn't. He believes, in his hard-
headed, inflexible way, that public money
is not to be gambled away either on jobs
and favors for spoilsmen or on the need-
less destruction of private enterprise. Tax-
payers ought to write their Representatives
that they believe, with Arthur Morgan,
that public money is something with which
public officials cannot afford to "sport."

**Psalm to Psalm**

On his fifth anniversary, the Presi-
dent read the nation a lecture out of Psalm
XV. With equal propriety, the nation
might have returned the greeting out of
Psalm CII.

"Mine enemies reproach me all the day;
and they that are mad against me are
sworn against me . . .

"Because of thine indignation and thy
wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and
cast me down.

"My days are like a shadow that de-
clineth; and I am withered like grass . . .

"Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon
Zion: for the time to favour her, yea, the
set time, is come."
