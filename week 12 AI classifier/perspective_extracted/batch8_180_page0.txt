**Perspective**

**The River of Doubt**

Once more a Roosevelt is to dis-
cover a River of Doubt. Just when the dis-
covery will be made is not easy to deter-
mine. Perhaps it will be very soon—soon
enough to rule out further consideration of
a third-term run. Perhaps, disastrously, it
will not come until after a decision to run
again. But sooner or later the discovery
must come. For the river is there—deep,
slow, irresistible.

This new River of Doubt flows quietly
in the consciousness of some millions of
Americans, most of middling means and
circumstances, most in small cities, towns
and rural districts and most in an area
running westward and northwestward
from Western Pennsylvania to the foot-
hills of the Rockies. I have had something
to say of this before. But new evidence
appears constantly.

Dr. Gallup’s most recent poll is taken
in an area including Ohio, Michigan, In-
diana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa,
Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, South Da-
kota and North Dakota. It shows that 64
per cent of a representative group of farm-
ers in these states believe that the Roose-
velt Administration program as a whole
has helped farmers, and 68 per cent think
Henry Wallace has done a good job. But
54 per cent prefer to see the Republicans
win this year. And only 37 per cent will
vote for Roosevelt if he runs again.

The political drift of which this is in-
dicative is of first importance. Remember
that these people are strategically situated.
Almost invariably the combined votes of
their states decide Presidential elections.
They are traditionally Republican. When
they went over to the Democratic party,
as they did in 1916 and 1932, they helped
to elect a Democratic President. Unless
they permanently change their party alle-
giance, the present Democratic regime is
bound to be temporary.

It looks as though they are shifting to
Republicanism again. It began to seem
that way even before November 1936,
when Roosevelt carried fewer counties than
he did in 1932, although his popular ma-
jority, largely located in great cities, was
a lot bigger. The 1937 local elections,
from Ohio westward, showed the trend
gaining. Likewise the 1938 elections in
that area. Now we have by-elections and
Dr. Gallup’s recent poll attesting the mo-
mentum of the drift.

Roosevelt was frankly an agrarian can-
didate in 1932. He and Louis Howe, his

long-time political adviser, had always
played their political cards so as to gather
in rural votes. They did it when Roosevelt
ran for New York State Senator 30 years
ago, in both his campaigns for the gover-
norship of New York and, again, in his first
Presidential campaign. But by 1936 some-
thing started to happen. The New Deal
began to emphasize issues of special inter-
est to great city populations. Labor, the
unemployed and the other great groups in
the cities were cultivated. The farmers
were not neglected, of course. But Roose-
velt’s strategy had changed basically.

At that moment the first faint trickles
that ultimately became the present River
of Doubt began to flow.

Dr. Gallup’s figures confirm not only
previous surveys of his, but the informed
judgments of canny political observers.
Summed up, they say simply this: A ma-
jority of people like the President and
think he has done a good job; but a certain
transcendently important proportion of
those who voted for him last time would
not vote for him for a third term. What
is this crucial proportion? Dr. Gallup’s
polls, over the past few months, show that
approximately 20 per cent of the Demo-
crats would not vote for Roosevelt as a
third-term candidate. In this present sur-
vey it can be seen that while 46 per cent
of the farm voters in the strategic states
polled show a disposition to vote Demo-
cratic, only 37 per cent would vote for
Roosevelt. This is a sizable discrepancy.

In short, if Mr. Roosevelt were as popu-
lar as ever, he would nevertheless have to
reckon with a formidable proportion of
opposition to a third term. And it is for-
midable. Presidential elections are decided,
for the most part, by rather small per-
centages of the total vote.

No one believes that the third-term is-
sue is the only source of weakness in the
popular strength of Mr. Roosevelt. There
are other doubts that swell the broad cur-
rent. All told, they are certainly sufficient
to make a shrewd man pause.

**Attacks on the FBI**

There’s no particular mystery about
the whys of the attacks that have been
made on J. Edgar Hoover and the Federal
Bureau of Investigation in recent weeks.
Such attacks on Hoover are an old story.
When the New Deal came into power in
1933, powerful efforts were made to get
him out. Some were open and palpable.
Most were covertly carried on by politi-
cians who wanted to break down the iron
defenses against political interference in
this important branch of the Federal serv-
ice, though they mumbled darkly about
Hoover’s getting too much publicity and
similar trivialities. All the efforts failed,
after fierce pulling and hauling. One of
the best aspects of Attorney General Cum-
mings’ whole administration was the fact
that he stood behind Hoover. So did At-
torney General Murphy. So, it is to be
hoped, will Attorney General Jackson.

Hoover’s critics of the moment are more
distinguished by their articulateness than
their numbers. Or, it might be added, by
their fairness. The current fussing boils
down to two specific charges.

The first involves wire tapping. It has
been whispered about that the Bureau in-
discriminately tapped the telephones of
members of Congress. The fact of the mat-
ter is that, in 1928, Mr. Hoover established
a regulation in the Bureau abolishing wire
tapping. This regulation remained in ef-
fect until 1931, when the Attorney General
directed the promulgation of a regulation
permitting wire tapping for certain legiti-
mate purposes. The Bureau flatly denies
that there has been any tapping of wires
except as a method of securing informa-
tion in extraordinary situations and in an
entirely legal manner, either where human
life was at stake or where the activities of
persons under investigation were of an ag-
gravated criminal nature. It is important
to note, however, that twice during this
time Mr. Hoover strongly advised against
his recommendation that Attorney Gen-
eral Jackson last week restored the rule
prohibiting wire tapping.

The second point of attack has to do
with the arrest of certain individuals in
Detroit who were charged with the viola-
tion of the law that prohibited the recruit-
ing of men for the Loyalist forces in Spain.
The facts, according to statements made
by the United States Attorney and the
United States Marshal in Detroit, are sim-
ply these: Under the direction of the As-
sistant United States Attorney General,
the FBI investigated the charges and
made the arrests. After the arraignment
of the prisoners, and, in accordance with
the proper procedure in these matters, the
prisoners were turned over to the United
States Marshal. The FBI had nothing fur-
ther to do with them. The prisoners were
handcuffed to a chain, along with other
Federal prisoners, and taken to jail. Thus
the claim that the FBI “chained” these
prisoners is wholly without foundation.

Frivolous and unfounded attacks on Mr.
Hoover are bound to be made by irre-
sponsible people. The country at large
knows him as the head of the most efficient
law-enforcement agency in the United
States. In view of its record, the FBI ought
to be among the last, rather than among
the first of governmental bureaus to be
investigated.
