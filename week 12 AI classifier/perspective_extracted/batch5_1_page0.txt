**The Shrinking Senate**

by Raymond Moley

Now that the Gravy Train Congress of 1957-58 has happily left the scene of its pretentious mummery, it is fitting to assess the damage it has created and to isolate for examination the major factor in the costly farce, the United States Senate. An appraisal of the late session indicates that if the Senate had been able to prevail, the debasement of the savings of the nation would have been greater by billions in the years ahead. Almost anything with a money tag had a chance to pass the Senate—preposterous, jerry-built schemes masked under dishonest titles and with alleged purposes nobly phrased but unsupported by reason and need. Someone said that members left the scene of their ostentatious nonsense in a “troubled mood.” Not half so troubled as the hoodwinked taxpayers and the thrifty whose savings have been looted by calculated inflation. The curtain rose in January with happy cries that there was unemployment, economic distress, and a threat of Russian scientific progress. Here, with an election in prospect, senators could see a golden opportunity. The statesmen rallied to everything that could be mislabeled defense or aid-to-the-ailing—with votes as the November booty.

to the fore the shrinking of the stature of the Senate itself. In election after election, members’ death, retirement, or defeat has monotonously brought in people of lesser stature. A Neuberger for a Cordon. A McNamara for a Ferguson. A Taft succeeded by a Bender. A Knowland by a Knight or an Engle. Read, if you can stand it, in the daily issues of the Congressional Record the endless chatter of Morse, Humphrey, and Javits. Scan the use of the Record by Neuberger as a catchall for the insertion of voluminous tripe. Note the occasional bellow by McNamara whenever his one and only interest is discussed. Then bring to mind that this Senate floor was once ennobled by the profound constitutional observations of Calhoun, Webster, Borah, and Taft; by the lonely, brave opposition of La Follette and the sharp financial genius of Glass.

**DOUBTFUL BOAST**

Consider, too, Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson in the big shoes of Joe Robinson and Alben Barkley (to go back only a few years). The word “leader” is the legal substitute for the reality of a man who eagerly followed the operators of the gravy train in his party, with an assist whenever needed by nominal Republicans Aiken, Case (N.J.), Cooper, Ives, Javits, Langer, Payne, and Smith (Maine). Here was an augmented majority that suited the natural bent of Johnson, who has never been anything but a “liberal.” A New York newspaper speaks of the frantic efforts of Johnson to kill a House bill defining the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court as a “triumph.” It was, rather, a triumph for Steve Nelson and others of the type who have now been told by the Supreme Court and the Congress that no state may take measures to combat subversion. There was an assist, too, by the Department of Justice. Consider this in the light of the deliberate judgment of the chief justices of ten American states who said recently that the Supreme Court has assumed “primarily legislative powers” and that there is now “considerable doubt” about our proud boast that we have “a government of laws and not of men.”

**COSTLY PROMISE**

The spending score of this Congress is a shocking and unprecedented peacetime $83 billion. The official figure for fiscal 1959 will be given out as $74 billion, which is $2.2 billion more than the President’s January estimates which seemed to cover everything that the President’s helpers could conjure up. There was, however, a neat trick of putting $9 billion of spending authorizations and supplementary appropriations into the fiscal year ending in June, but the money will have to be found hereafter. The Senate actually voted for $88 billion, but the House, largely because of the Rules Committee and its indefatigable chairman Howard Smith, killed $5 billion. Therefore, we can look ahead to years with more than $80 billion actual expenditures. This, considering the expected revenues, promises a truly alarming inflationary spiral. The shrinking of the dollar brings
