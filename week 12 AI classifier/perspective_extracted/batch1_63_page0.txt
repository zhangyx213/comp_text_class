**PRAGMATIC REPUBLICAN**

BY RAYMOND MOLEY

Los Angeles—Most political talk here
centers upon 1966 candidates for gov-
ernor. Two Republicans, Ronald Rea-
gan and George Christopher, will run
for the nomination in the June pri-
mary. Gov. Edmund G. Brown will
try to succeed himself. And Samuel
W. Yorty, Mayor of Los Angeles,
threatens to wrest the Democratic
nomination from Brown. Visiting com-
mentators fill their dispatches with
their names.

However, I find the most interest-
ing candidate to be Robert H. Finch,
who declared himself to be a Repub-
lican candidate for lieutenant gover-
nor some months ago. At the moment
no substantial Republican opposition
is in sight.

There is something fresh, clear and
pragmatic about Finch's appeal. His
concept of the meaningful political
problems of California is a lesson in
realistic politics.

Finch, correctly it seems to me,
conceives that the people of this
country since the confusion of 1964
have grown sick and tired of old ideo-
logical expressions such as "liberal,"
"conservative," "left" and "right,"
"moderate," "radical" and "extreme"
this or that. The glue on the old party
labels doesn't stick any more.

**FACTS OUTRUN THEORIES**

The rapidly changing facts of Amer-
ican life mock old political philoso-
phies. There is an old German saying
that facts are quicker than thoughts.
Before a political credo is thought
out and written, the world on which
it is based has passed away.

Finch makes the relevant point that
the United States is at the end of one
era and entering another. Within a
relatively few years three of every
four Americans will live and work in
a few great megalopolitan areas. In
California there is in the making a
vast urban and semiurban complex
stretching from the Golden Gate to
San Diego. There will be larger and
larger cities in this area, loosely
linked together by a chain of free-
ways and other means of transporta-
tion and communication. It will be so
throughout the nation—from Boston
to Washington, from Pittsburgh to
Milwaukee and elsewhere.

The Federal government is some-
what but not clearly aware of this
change. It created the Health, Edu-
cation and Welfare Department and
the new Department of Housing and
Urban Development. Next will come
a Department of Transportation. But
despite these pretensions and billions
of expenditures, the Federal estab-
lishment cannot alone meet the prob-
lems of these population congestions.
The limits of Federal spending are al-
ready in sight. Besides, the problems
of such areas differ one from another.
No bureaucracy can plan for all. Self-
help must come from the lower levels
of government and, what is most im-
portant, from what is called the "pri-
vate sector."

**FINCH'S LEADERSHIP**

This is not to say along with some
reactionaries that we must repeal the
Federal trend of the past 30 years.
That was an era when Washington
helped on the local levels. Now, look-
ing ahead, the local levels must help
the Federal establishment to carry
the burden. The latent resources in
wealth and talent are there at those
levels. They must be mobilized.

The political party that grasps these
practical facts can move forward as-
sured of the confidence of a public
which is well aware of these changes.

That is what Finch is telling the
people of California. He has spent
twenty of his 40 years in thinking and
acting in the political arena. When I
first knew him fifteen years ago, he
was the director of the Los Angeles
Republican Associates. Later, while
practicing law he ran unsuccessfully
for Congress. Late in the 1950s he
was Vice President Nixon's adminis-
trative assistant and in 1960 he
shared with Len Hall the management
of Nixon's Presidential campaign. His
genius for political organization was
shown in 1964 when he successfully
managed George Murphy's campaign
for the U.S. Senate.

The lieutenant governorship in Cal-
ifornia attracted him because that of-
fice is far more important there than
it is elsewhere. The lieutenant gov-
ernor is ex officio member of many
important state agencies. With inde-
pendence from the governor, Finch's
fresh and enlightened views could be
injected deeply into state policies.
These progressive ideas might well be
noted by GOP leaders everywhere.
