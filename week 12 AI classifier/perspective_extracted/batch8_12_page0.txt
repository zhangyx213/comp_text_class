**A Voice From the Bureaucracy**

by RAYMOND MOLEY

While the earth-shaking conflicts at the top of our bureaucracy are well known to the public, few people realize what happens down the line among the little fellows in a great government machine. But what happens there is of critical importance to all of us.

I have recently received a letter from a man who entered the colossal Federal machine in an important but minor capacity. His account of his reflections upon the ways of bureaucracy is an interesting picture of a neglected scene. He says, in part:

"The rivalry of the czars of various agencies is well known, but the clash goes all the way down the line like little ripples from a big splash. During the last year I have proceeded along my usual assumption—that everyone is cooperative and decent. This is not a blind policy, but simply a refusal to take rumors and gossip for granted and a desire to make my own judgments, at least until I can find those upon whose judgment I can depend.

"At the beginning I got plenty of advice. So-and-So was an obstructionist, So-and-So was trying to get more power for himself, and so on. By this time I have begun to realize that the rumors are true for most of the men in charge of subsections and units, but that the mormongers are probably the worst of-fenders.

"Each section head is obsessed by the Federal psychosis of fearing that he really isn't as important as he thinks he is and that some day his work and his section's work might diminish. Therefore, he argues to himself, I must get more work all the time, take over more duties, create new duties which I must convince my superiors are essential. It never occurs to such people that their work might be diminishing because they are finishing the job they were hired to do or, conversely, that they aren't getting less busy because they haven't been going after their particular job in a straightforward manner.

"But the point is that each section is a little England content with its empire, or a little Germany seeking lebensraum. The Federal chiefs go stomping around straining at the bit to be important and to stay where they are, at least. Their motto seems to be: 'For God's sake, don't make a decision—and if you ever have to, be sure to have someone to blame if it's a bad decision.' The fear of being wrong in the few government agencies I know anything about is almost pathological. And that means considerable time is spent covering up and buck-passing."

The remedy suggested by this disillusioned young man is perhaps less convincing than his diagnosis. But it has pertinent elements. He suggests: "The whole mess seems to be chronic in the present setup of government agencies. The system is essentially absolutely feudal. There is a big boss at the top, a lot of sub-bosses, and a legion of sub-sub-bosses. Each agency, unit, section and subsection is organized along such lines and is simply a glorified form of the lord and his manorial underlings. I am convinced that the solution will have to come by organizing agencies along parallel instead of hierarchal lines. There should be several heads, all cooperating, and consulting with one another in line with a clearly defined over-all policy. And the same should hold all the way down the line. The thing that holds such things up, of course, is the desire of the little officials to be more important than those working with them, to monopolize credit, and to belittle others who are getting credit."

The true remedy, I feel sure, is much more fundamental. The evils he describes are inherent in an overgrown bureaucracy governed by a political system. Rewards in such a system always go to those who do not dare to take chances. Penalties are imposed on people of imagination, forthrightness and initiative. The true remedy for bureaucracy is less bureaucracy.

Specifically, it means that a primary postwar planning job needs to be done, with the purpose of reducing the concentration of power in Washington. The laws must be combed through and through to see what emergency agencies live on after the emergency that created them.

Moreover, many functions should go back to the states permanently and completely. When the states need money to do this, Federal grants may be given by Congress, but administration of such matters as postwar relief and education should be the responsibility of the individual states.

The bureaucracy cannot plan this change for itself. It should be made by a clear decision in a national election, and both parties might well put this point in their platforms.
