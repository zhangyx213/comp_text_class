**PERSPECTIVE**

**Politics and Integration**

by Raymond Moley

IT HAS been claimed by some Republicans in New York and the Northeast generally that ultra-segregationists in the South have sought refuge in the Republican Party because of the strong racial policies of the Kennedy Administration. Hence, these people say, Republicans should write off the South and dedicate themselves to winning Negro votes in Northern cities which are now solidly Democratic. Those people know neither the facts nor the mood of Southern conservatism.

A major objective of my visits to four Gulf states and South Carolina was to study this question at first hand. The main reason why traditional Democratic areas are voting Republican is basic conservatism, economic and political. With industrial growth perhaps more pronounced there than anywhere else, they are seeking relief from Federal intrusion into their lives and businesses. Of this I assured myself not only by talking with many people, but by examining speeches made in 1962 by Republican candidates.

A preponderant majority of white people in the South want to deal with the racial problem without interference from Northern states and from Washington. They say, quite correctly, that there is enough unfinished integration in the North and in Washington to keep reformers occupied at home.

**VOTES FOR WELFARE**

Since there is such unanimity of public opinion on the racial problem, it is not an issue between the two parties in those states. Most of the extreme spokesmen for white supremacy are and will probably continue to be Democrats. In states where Citizens Councils are strongest, some members are in the Republican Party, others are Democratic, many are independent.

Intelligent white people in the South tell us of their knowledge of the Negro and of the economic and cultural progress of this once submerged race long before the 1954 ruling of the Supreme Court. In several states integration was making progress. Moreover, most states, notably South Carolina, had adopted measures to provide excellent "separate but equal" educational facilities for Negroes. Federal troops in Little Rock and Oxford were irritating reminders of the Reconstruction.

The almost unanimous vote of Negroes for Democratic candidates, even for ultra-segregationists, raises the question whether civil rights is their primary concern. Rather, it is claimed that Negroes in the South, as well as in the Northern cities, really vote for the welfare measures of Democratic administrations.

One item of proof that civil rights is not a party issue is that in Texas, where Republicanism is strongest, integration has made its greatest gains.

**THE REAL ISSUE**

New Yorkers need to be reminded that when there is solid public opinion on a big issue, it ceases to be an issue between the parties in a state. In the 1920s, neither a Democratic Gov. Al Smith nor a Republican Sen. James Wadsworth argued about Prohibition. Both were against it. Prohibition was decreed by an amendment to the Constitution and by Federal laws, not by the Supreme Court's interpretation of the vague language of the Fourteenth Amendment. And the Eighteenth Amendment among members of both parties was more honored in the breach than in the observance. So let us, in the North, not tincture our zeal with hypocrisy and political expediency.

Some Republicans in the South ignore the racial issue. Others indicate their conformity to public opinion on the subject.

In Alabama in 1962 Sen. Lister Hill was facing almost certain defeat by a Republican because of his liberal voting record in Congress. In the final days of the campaign he made a television speech in which he bitterly attacked the Republican Party as the author and agent of integration. He portrayed himself as the true protector of white supremacy. This speech probably won him the slim margin needed to win.

It is the essential conservatism of the South that is the reason for the emergence of a two-party system. It would have happened if there had been no racial problem.
