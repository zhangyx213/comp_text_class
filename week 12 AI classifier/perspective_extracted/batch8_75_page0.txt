**Andrew Jackson (The Hell It Can't) Higgins**

**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

NEW ORLEANS—Last week Rear Admiral Emory S. Land, chairman of the United States Maritime Commission, told the Senate committee investigating war production some pretty melancholy facts about our vital shipbuilding program, which is 12 1/2 percent behind schedule. But at one point, at least, in this sad recital Admiral Land permitted himself unreserved enthusiasm. It was in talking of the work in progress around New Orleans' Higgins Industries, Inc.—one of the most remarkable American production achievements this war has turned up.

It isn't often that in writing about a city you can mention only one man's name and get away with it. But the eminence of Andrew Jackson Higgins is such that nobody is jealous of him here, everyone is proud of him and everyone is talking about him. And, believe me, after spending eight hours with him, I can state positively that Higgins and what he is doing are something to talk about. He is first cousin to a hurricane.

Higgins was born in Nebraska 55 years ago and went as a young man to New Orleans, where he became one of the largest lumber dealers in the country. In the course of time his lumber business led him to the making of small boats of a wide variety of shapes and sizes. Such was his inventive genius that he devised an astonishing variety of improvements in construction until, ultimately, the basic pattern of his present Eureka craft emerged—a pattern which, with superficial modifications, is in his landing boats, tank and truck tenders, motor torpedo boats and many others that are writing the history of this war from New Orleans around the world. It is no secret that since the war began in 1939 he has built thousands for the British, the Dutch, the United States Engineers, the Coast Guard, for oil companies and for South America. Are they good? Ask the Commandos, or the British Admiralty or our own Admirals King and Land. Jumping over sand bars, floating logs or rough surf, these boats climb out of the water on mud, sand or concrete, discharge their loads and, with only one man at the controls, literally back out like a car from a garage, turn in their own length and speed away for more.

Now Higgins is going to build ships as well as boats. He has received a contract to build 200 Liberty ships—10,500-ton ships. He promises to begin delivery in September and to produce at the rate of one a day. That rate, ladies and gentlemen, equals what all our shipbuilding facilities are now doing. "It can't be done," someone told Higgins. "The hell it can't!" was the answer. And don't bet against Higgins. There can be as many more than 200 as are needed, for once this man gets under way it's going to be easier for him to go on than to stop. The original contract is $385,000,000 for the Liberty ships. It is claimed in New Orleans that no shipbuilding operation in the history of the world approaches this.

The method of building these ships on a production line has been called a "secret" method. It is no secret at all. Admiral Land described the gist of it in his testimony. Land said that it is revolutionary—the most unusual type of ship construction ever attempted. Higgins' assembly line for small boats broke precedents. His construction of big ships will break more.

But it is Higgins himself who takes your breath away as much as his remarkable products and his fantastic ability to multiply his products at headlong speed. Higgins is an authentic master builder, with the kind of will power, brains, drive and daring that characterized the American empire builders of an earlier generation. In more ways than one it is curiously fitting that Higgins' activities center in the region around New Orleans. For circumstances forced by this war are making the Gulf ports important beyond imagining. Whatever the outcome of this war it is probable that we will be turning more and more to the South and the West for our international contacts, for our raw materials and for markets. For a lifeline south, nature has pointed for centuries at the Mississippi Valley. New Orleans is its gateway. And Andrew Jackson Higgins towers in that gateway.
