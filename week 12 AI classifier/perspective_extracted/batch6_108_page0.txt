**Socialism Smothered in Oil—II**

by Raymond Moley

CALGARY, ALBERTA—The Rev. William Aberhart, a popular radio preacher, teacher of mathematics, and political prophet of Social Credit, could not have been aware that the British North American Act, like the American Constitution, vests all the great fiscal powers in the national government. Hence, after Aberhart became Premier of Alberta in 1935, he saw all his laws designed to put his theories into effect stricken down by the Supreme Court, the Dominion Parliament, and the Privy Council. Like Niobe, he was dowed in grief over the slaughter of his children. Little did he realize he never had it so good. For he was not only provided with an ironclad alibi, so valuable to a politician who had made promises, but he was compelled to follow the straight and narrow path of orthodox government. This attracted those millions of outside capital essential to a province rich in natural resources but too poor to exploit them alone.

The original Social Credit ideas are as dead as John Law’s Mississippi Bubble and are hardly worth explaining. Suffice it to say that a British Major Douglas had concocted a scheme which Aberhart found useful in filling out his Biblical broadcasts. It held that the dollar value of all production was generally higher than the purchasing power of the citizenry. To balance things and to make everybody prosperous, the government would have to print more money and give that money to the people. The villains in the story were international bankers, just as they were in the sermons of the Rev. Charles Coughlin, Detroit’s radio priest. There were other similarities between the two clerics. Aberhart called the banker-controlled currency “fountain-pen money.” Coughlin called it “checkbook money.”

Aberhart, realizing that the jargon of Douglas was a bit over the heads of the Alberta farmers, put flesh and bones on theory by saying that to start the presses whirring, $25 a month would be given to each and every Albertan. This promise was never kept and no one seemed to mind. In 1943, Aberhart died and was succeeded by a sort of curate in his Biblical institute, Ernest Manning. The new Premier had great luck. Nature opened her horn of plenty and there gushed forth oil and gas in enormous quantities. Manning was mild-mannered and conservative and made favorable terms with the oil companies. Into the provincial treasury in eight years there flowed $400 million in royalties and lease compensation. Agriculture boomed with the war, and tourists flocked to see the mountains. Manning was able to keep taxes down, and grateful votes poured in at every election. In 1952 Manning won 51 of the 61 seats in the legislature. The Liberals were reduced to four, and the CCF to two.

But power and plenty had their inevitable way with the crusaders. The deadly cycle from idealism, to arrogance, to corruption appeared. J. Harper Prowse, the leader of the little Liberal group, and the powerful Calgary Herald began to ask embarrassing questions. It appeared that some of the SC brethren in the legislature had been getting loans at the treasury offices which were designed, like most government lending operations everywhere, to lend to risks the banks could not safely undertake. This was said to be perfectly legal but it was, to say the least, unseeming among the anointed heirs of a Prophet. There were other matters which raised serious questions about members of the Cabinet itself.

Thrown on the defensive, Manning called an election for June of this year. Little was discussed in the campaign except the indiscretions and improprieties of the members of SC. The result was a big loss to Manning’s party. His following dropped to 37 and he lost three Cabinet ministers.

ONLY occasionally do you hear the old Social Credit ideas mentioned. Manning himself only brings them up once a year in a paragraph at the end of his budget speech as a salute to the departed Prophet. Social Credit is in business now—big business—and the danger may be that the purity of some of its followers may have been subdued to the clay in which they labor.
