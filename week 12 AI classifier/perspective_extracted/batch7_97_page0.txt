**Two Little Words**

by RAYMOND MOLEY

This would seem to be a long piece
to write about two little words,
but it carries a long moral and, I believe, an important one.
One of the most distressing features
of New York politics is that in every
campaign there is drawn out of storage a monstrous effigy called religious
bigotry. It is trundled through the
boroughs and along the upstate farm
roads amid the shrieks of
children and the screeching
of politicians. The public,
or a large part thereof, falls
for this gag. People who
never step inside their
churches suddenly become
aware of their religion and
become crusaders, thirsty
for the blood of all believers
in other creeds. This is
a perennial, and politicians
too lazy to think up genuine issues
thrive on it.

But politicians, who are smart and
often amusing fellows-even those
who are hypocrites and dirty players
—would not use this fraudulent vote
bait if people were not moved by it.
Many members of religious sects, and
I make no important exceptions here,
are all too prone to forget the broad
ethical considerations of their particular gospel. They conceive their membership, however casual, as a ticket
for leave to fly at the throats of all
other sorts of believers. They become
so conscious of their particular and
special rights that they cannot observe the basic brotherhood of all religions. As an old Catholic bishop once
said to a confirmation class: “There
are some members of this church who
are more anxious to stand up for their
religion than to kneel down for it.”

It has got so bad in New York that
if you tell a harmless joke in dialect
you will be accused of belonging to a
murderous conspiracy.


In the present campaign for United
States senator between John Foster Dulles and Herbert Lehman, the
old scarecrow has been dragged in
again. The pretext is as silly and, it
should be added, as phony as any of
its predecessors.

Dulles first said that, since the
Communist-infested American Labor
Party had no candidate, its members
would probably vote for Lehman, the
Democrat. Since the ALP did support
Lehman in 1946, this was a good inference. “Bigot,” cries Lehman, with
a couple of “diabolicals” and other
adjectives. To prove it, Lehman cited
in a letter to Dulles an alleged Dulles
quote: “If you could see the kind of
people in New York City making up
this bloc that is voting for my opponent, if you could see them with
your own eyes,” etc.

Well, the context of the
speech shows that the
“bloc” to which Dulles referred was the ALP.

The italicized word
“them” above appeared in
one newspaper. The word
was “it” in another. The
stenotype recording of the
speech had “it”—meaning
bloc, meaning Communist-
dominated ALP.

Lehman’s letter states, referring to
the Communist issue, that you cannot
tell a Communist by looking at him.
Hence the “sinister” meaning—the
“bigotry.”

To pursue the point a bit farther,
you can identify a group of Communists by looking at them, not because they are of a single physical
type, but by the way they behave. The
recent trial of the eleven Communists
before Judge Medina amply proved
that, and Dulles was right.


Thus is an issue made which determines the identity of a senator
of the United States, while all other
matters that really count are forgotten.

It would help greatly if ministers,
priests, rabbis, and other religious
leaders would at the outset of every
important campaign frankly and emphatically warn their people against
this political snare. It is not sufficient
to preach tolerance in general terms.
All too often the use of that good
word means special pleading for tolerance toward the person doing the
preaching. The way to win tolerance
is to be tolerant. And the best means
of attaining more tolerance is to keep
religion out of politics and politics out
of religion.

This New York fuss over two little
words is no credit to a highly civilized
state. Nor is it a credit to the people
who are making much over nothing.
