**PERSPECTIVE**

**Caesar the Destroyer**
by Raymond Moley

ROYALTY, said Walter Bagehot
nearly a century ago, is one person
doing interesting things. A republic
is many people doing uninteresting
things. The British could understand
obedience to a queen. They had only
hazy notions about law without a
queen. The explanation is that human
feelings are strong and human
reason is weak.

This explains not only the durability
of the British Crown but why
Americans have always been intrigued
by activist statesmen like TR
and FDR but have been left cold by
the sober lawfulness of the two Tafts.
It is also, in part, the reason why
Julius Caesar has been exalted over
Cicero. From Theodor Mommsen's
scholarly but slanted history of Rome
to the present gaudy production of
"Cleopatra," Caesar's virtues have
been exaggerated. Mommsen's history,
upon which most academic
blessings have been bestowed, was
written in the 1850s when the author
was eagerly anticipating the coming
of a German Empire.

A week ago I commented upon a
quite different interpretation of the
dissolution of the Roman Republic by
John Dickinson, an immensely talented
American lawyer, professor,
and scholar. An excerpt from Dickinson's
3,000 manuscript pages has
been edited by George Lee Haskins,
a colleague of Dickinson ("Death of
a Republic," Macmillan). The book
mainly concerns the period from Caesar's
first consulship to his assassination
in 44 B.C. In Dickinson's account
Caesar is the enemy and Cicero the
conscience of republicanism. At issue
were the laws and constitutional institutions
of the dying Roman Republic.
Involved in the revolution were
the patricians, the constitutionalists,
conspirators and politicians, and the
urban masses in the city of Rome.

**DECAY OF CHARACTER**

The once-sturdy fiber of the Roman
people as well as their protective
institutions had been undergoing
a decline for a long time. Dickinson
makes special mention of the Gracchi
brothers in the second century
B.C. Contrary to the stories we read
in our schoolbooks, these individuals
were demagogues who corrupted the
populace and undermined the constitution.
Caesar built his power
through this weakness.

In his earlier years Caesar employed
the tactics of machine politics
with which Americans are so well
acquainted. His machine operated
through bribery, daring usurpations,
and public benefactions with money
provided by callous and ambitious
rich Romans. His henchmen won support
by public handouts when expedient
and occasionally by planned
violence and disorder. As he rose to
supreme power, Caesar secured for
himself election to one republican office
after another, even attaining the
sacred office of pontiff to clothe himself
with religious authority. Later his
well-advertised military expeditions
yielded personal glamour and spoils
for the Roman mobs. In the aftermath
of the Cleopatra affair he beguiled
Romans with the absurd image of
himself as a peer of the gods.

**CICERO'S OPPOSITION**

Dickinson says Caesar substituted
"a new mystical basis of authority for
the traditional sanctions of the old
Republic. At the moment of his death
he had built nothing, founded nothing
[except] a psychological acceptance
for his rule." Into this
vacuum moved the emperors and the
praetorian guard.

Cicero struggled against this institutional
corruption. The principles
embodied in his speeches and writings
were the supremacy of law
which rested upon long-term concepts
of justice, the exercise of official
power under the limitations of republican
institutions, checks and balances
to prevent the abuse of authority, respect
for organic growth represented
in traditions of proven worth. Finally,
he held that the character of government
is determined by the integrity
of the people who live under it.
Cicero saw government as an agency
under law and above the caprice of
classes or even of majorities.

He labored for these ideas to his
death. But he failed in the context of
a greatly enfeebled and corrupted
Roman character.
His warnings embody wisdom
which our generation will ignore at
deadly peril to human liberty.
