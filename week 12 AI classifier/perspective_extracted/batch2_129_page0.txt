**Report on Wasteland—III**

**by Raymond Moley**

A REMARKABLY honest and well-
intentioned bureaucracy can
waste more through incompetence
and extravagance than ancient gov-
ernments abroad lost through larceny
and extortions. This is shown in the
hundreds of reports to Congress of
Joseph Campbell, Comptroller Gen-
eral of the United States. A laborious
examination of those reports yields a
number of conclusions and reflections.
All bureaucracies are inherently
wasteful. Our Federal establishment
has added a number of refinements:
Department heads are chosen by
Presidents not because of proven ad-
ministrative capacity but because of
political, personal, or regional consid-
erations. Under those department
heads there are many levels of su-
pervision. Effective control lessens as
authority passes from top to bottom.
Civil-service rules compel bureau
heads to suffer the incompetence of
subordinates rather than go through
the rigmarole of firing them. Stand-
ards of competence reward those
who operate "by the book," and little
recognition goes to those who risk
innovations. A bureau head gains sta-
tus according to the number of peo-
ple who are working for him. This
is a built-in incentive for growth.
Those in the ranks must spend all
that they have. For if any is left,
less will be appropriated next year. A
bureaucracy attracts those who seek
security rather than those who have
imagination and take risks. And there
is little local and intimate scrutiny by
citizen-taxpayers. The source of au-
thority is far away in Washington.
But most of the evils of bureauc-
racy have been well known for cen-
turies. Why has this enlightened and
literate nation been permitted to fol-
low in the path of ancient China,
Persia, and Rome?

1—An ideology has taken hold
during the past 50 years which is
now called "liberal" and which main-
tains that since revenues from the
Federal income tax seem inexhaust-
ible, it is desirable to have the Fed-
eral government take over activities
formerly left to individuals, private
organizations, and states and local
communities. This is supported by
the argument that modern life has,
through transportation and commu-
nication, made the country more

compact and interdependent. This is
preached in classrooms, the press,
and innumerable books and speeches.
2—Politics has seized upon this
ideology and has energetically pro-
moted more and more programs at
the Federal level. Politics finds these
vastly productive of votes and public
support. Dependency upon Uncle
Sam grows and grows.
3—In welfare, private sources of
help are dried up by high taxes,
and the old local political machines
have withered away.
4—An immense defense establish-
ment creates new community neces-
sities for more non-defense programs
at the local level.
5—Among the old, the young, the
workers, the ill, and the "underprivi-
leged," organized minorities rise
which demand Federal programs.
6—Wherever I go in the states I
hear loud demands at meetings of
chambers of commerce and other
local organizations for economy in
Washington. But these local interests
cry out for their own slice of the
Federal pie. Since everyone is get-
ting it, why not our "little" project?
7—Congress and administrations
dump upon the bureaucracy ill-
considered and indigestible programs
which must be made to work some-
how, some way.

It is not easy to suggest a remedy
for the ensuing waste. Perhaps this
must go on until general austerity
faces us and forces a contraction.
Then the good, along with the bad,
will be eliminated.

One measure that might be en-
acted would be for a really eco-
nomical Congress to call a moratorium
on all new programs. It would then
set itself to the business of the elimi-
nation of those activities which are
patently useless.

Or a truly strong President might
be elected who would, like Ruther-
ford B. Hayes, do what is necessary
but unpopular and pledge himself
to seek no second term.

But can the American people be
educated to elect such a Congress
and President? Not without a lot
more education. And the heart of
such education would be a clear
demonstration that our wayward
course cannot be followed many
more years without disaster.
