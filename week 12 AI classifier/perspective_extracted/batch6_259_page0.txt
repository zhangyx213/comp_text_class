SANTA BARBARA—The issue of jurisdiction in this campaign between the amateur “Citizens for Eisenhower” and the professional Republican National Committee was resolved after days of discussion in Denver. The Citizens for Eisenhower group will maintain its distinctive status, but there must be clearance at all levels—national, state, and local.

It is to be hoped that this arrangement will work smoothly, because the Eisenhower-Nixon campaign will have plenty of problems without internal conflicts. Such a conflict in 1940 between the amateur Willkie clubs and the regular Republican organization was one of the major factors in Republican defeat.

Certainly there will be needed the utmost efforts of both amateurs and professionals this year if the Republicans are to win. In my judgment, 6,000,000 to 8,000,000 more voters must be found than the 22,000,000 who voted for Dewey in 1948. Stevenson will draw more votes than Truman in any event, partly because the population has increased and partly because Wallace and Thurmond will not be in the field. It is not unreasonable to expect 28,000,000 people to vote Democratic. This must be substantially topped.

I should guess that the regular Republican organization will be able to muster 25,000,000. Somebody must drag four or five million more from the ranks of the 42,000,000 who did not vote in 1948 and the new voters since that year. And since some people persistently say that those votes must come from former Democratic voters, I want to emphasize that Truman’s 24,000,000 in 1948 represents an irreducible minimum. Stevenson will get most of those and more.

Therefore, the “somebody” mentioned above must be the amateurs. But the amateur must realize that the professionals are not people with cloven hooves, horns, and itching palms. They are in the vast majority of cases fine fellows who over the years have given much more of their time and energy to public affairs than have their critics. Moreover, they have a quality from which the amateur can greatly profit—political know-how. They are, in addition, the people who must run the party twelve months of the year, every year. Willard Brown, a young man in Cleveland who is one of a group of civic-minded citizens who are getting into the fight this year, makes these reasonable remarks:

“The legally constituted county organization is the only effective medium for political expression and influence. It is important that the volunteer accept the fact that the regular organization is the only means of obtaining an election in depth and of providing a continuity of support to the community’s legislative delegations—a support that may serve to provide some immunity against highly organized pressure groups. In addition, experience has proved that the volunteer may effect as much harm as good if his efforts are not under competent experienced direction. The organization is the most effective medium of insuring the maximum utilization of the individual.”

Another point or two might be added. The amateur should, so far as possible, permit the “regulars” to take the bows, preside at meetings, and issue statements. He can, if he really wants to serve unselfishly, forgo immediate public credit. He will be amazed at how cooperative the professional will be if he is given praise and encouragement. He can also learn to his dismay how easily the professional can frustrate him if he excites antagonism. The cup of credit will overflow for all if Eisenhower wins.

IT SHOULD be added that amateur groups can and should be organized with or without affiliation with the Citizens for Eisenhower formal organization. This is everybody’s fight. The main requirements are energy, leadership, a determination to get the right people to register and vote, and friendly contact with the Republican organization at the local level.

This campaign begins on a note quite unlike that of 1948. There was Republican overoptimism then. There is certainly none now. Perhaps that is best to arouse the potentially powerful amateur.
