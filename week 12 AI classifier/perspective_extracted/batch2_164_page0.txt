**PERSPECTIVE**

**The Victim of an Image**

by Raymond Moley

IN CURRENT discussion of what is called the "image" of Mr. Kennedy, it may have been overlooked that the word derives from the same root as "imagination." It is something that exists only in minds. Webster says it is "something that represents, or is regarded as representing, another thing."

Image-making is a thriving business which thousands of advertising, public-relations, and political people find highly profitable. Mr. Kennedy in his 1960 campaign laid the basis for his image by talking about "strong" Presidents, mainly Lincoln, Woodrow Wilson, and Franklin D. Roosevelt.

Those Presidents created the image of strength largely because the times made it possible. Lincoln and Wilson had wars. Roosevelt had a depression which enabled him to say in his 1933 inaugural that he would ask Congress to give him "broad Executive power to wage a war against the emergency, as great as the power that would be given to me if we were in fact invaded by a foreign foe."

An image once thoroughly implanted in men's imaginings may serve its beneficiary well. It may save him much labor and rational proof in overcoming opposition.

**THE LITTLE LAPSES**

Emerson said, quoting a mythical character, Iole: "When I beheld Theseus, I desired that I might see him offer battle, or at least guide his horses in a chariot race; but Hercules did not wait for a contest, he conquered whether he stood or walked, or sat, or whatever he did." As the story goes, Iole discovered to her sorrow that the Hercules image was very substantial. He sacked her father's city and took Iole prisoner.

But one can become the prisoner of an image. Its owner must not presume upon it or overly enlarge it. Little lapses born of self-assurance are perilous. In this instance the image encompasses a family, personal and official, whose members may cause irreparable damage. Brother Robert's lecturing to strange and alien peoples, brother Edward's immature reach for the toga once worn by Webster, the dunkings in the swimming pool, the dog-walking, the arrogance of office, the self-assurance and ill-considered chatter of some of the eggheads-all the extracurricular antics are blazoned forth in the public prints and over the air. These create the suspicion that if there has been imprudence in little things there will surely be imprudence in many big things.

The actual power possessed in the constitutional Executive must be sparingly used. Battle axes must not be used to break down frail fences. Constant quibbling with the press adds nothing to an image of strength.

**NO EMERGENCY**

Let us see what this has to do with the successive disasters in Congress. Opposition there has become dogged determination not because members have discounted the image of a puissant President. It is in large part because members have taken the image too literally. Fear and distrust rise with every demand for more Presidential authority and discretion.

No doubt, there is need for new trade legislation and for certain additional Executive power. If an Eisenhower had requested such power, it might have been granted because in his career he had borne his powers with the sincere humility of a public servant rather than as a master. But each demand by Kennedy for new power creates strong opposition-the authority to cut taxes and to spend money on public works at Executive discretion, and also the grab for a dictatorship over agriculture. The threat of the image looms over the man himself.

The parallels with Lincoln, Wilson, and FDR were drawn without telling the whole story. The powers exercised by Lincoln in war were sharply hacked away by the Supreme Court after the end of hostilities. The Armistice marked the end of Wilson's great influence. And from 1936 on, Roosevelt suffered humiliating rebuffs in his effort to reorganize the Supreme Court, in his demand for power to reorganize the Executive Department, and in his efforts to purge his party in 1938.

It seems to have been forgotten that John F. Kennedy inherited neither a war nor a depression, but an economy rising toward a boom.
