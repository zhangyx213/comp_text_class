**Under God and Law**

by Raymond Moley

The successive blows which the Supreme Court of the United States has leveled at the laws of Congress and the states designed to protect the nation against Communism have created a constitutional crisis which gives added pertinence to a subject I had intended to consider this week. The American Bar Association is to hold six days of its annual meeting in London in July. There in England, on the hallowed ground which saw the birth of our own liberty under law, our lawyers and judges will pay tribute to the great patriots who fought long ago for free men. We fought our revolution to vindicate our rights not as colonists but as Englishmen. Burke reminded a stupid king and his government that an Englishman was "the last person in the world" to deny rights to another Englishman.

The members of the American bar will pay tribute to Sir Edward Coke at his tomb in Tittingham in Norfolk. No lawyer who plans to make this pilgrimage to London should miss reading Catherine Drinker Bowen's recent book, "The Lion and the Throne, the Life and Times of Sir Edward Coke (1552-1634)." It is the sort of book that makes a wonderful traveling companionâ€”massive, informative, but immensely moving and stimulating. Here are portrayed the places and events of the period during which the people of England, through their Parliament, substantially brought autocracy to a final end.

**FRUSTRATED JUDGE**

Coke is best known as a judge and commentator on the laws of England. Endowed with a brilliant mind, a singular capacity for clear, colorful expression, and vast energy, he labored for years in the Inner Temple before Elizabeth made him Attorney General. Of his service in this office the least said the better. His conviction of Sir Walter Raleigh was a deed of hideous injustice.

Later, as Chief Justice of Common Pleas, Chief Justice of King's Bench, and Lord Chief Justice of England, he upheld every right and principle which he had violated as Attorney General. His struggle against the absolutist pretensions of James I, a man who compounded stupidity with pedantry, lives in the traditions of every lawyer. He fought for the supremacy of the common law against the church, the Admiralty, the Star Chamber, and the King. Best known is his encounter with James, when the King, shaking his fist at Coke, said that "Law was founded upon Reason, and that he and others had Reason as well as the Judges." Coke answered "Bracton saith, that the King should not be under man, but under God and the Laws."

**VICTORIOUS STATESMAN**

Ultimately James, nudged on by the unscrupulous, mean-spirited Francis Bacon, removed Coke from his judgeship, and thereafter during the reign of James the judiciary was not only subservient but unbelievably corrupt. Bacon rose to the top and, as Macaulay put it, was in his judicial conduct "not even the last lingering adherent of an old abuse, but was guilty of attempting to introduce into the courts of law an odious abuse for which no precedent could be found."

Coke is remembered best as a judge and commentator. But his greater role was as a member and leader of the House of Commons. Under Elizabeth he had been Speaker and spokesman of a House that vexed the Queen by making her conform to the budgets which it deemed prudent. After his removal from the courts, Coke in his old age enjoyed the crowning glory of leading the successful fight to make King Charles agree to the great petition of right. It is worthy of note that Coke always regarded the legislative department of government as the High Court of Parliament, supreme over the courts and, in its appointed sphere, over the royal prerogative. Coke failed as a judge but triumphed as a statesman.

Parliament, not the courts, has over the centuries subdued absolutism and established the liberties of the people. No court of England might frustrate Parliament as the current Supreme Court has impaired the efforts of the Congress and the Executive to protect the nation. This is a point that Americans might well ponder.
