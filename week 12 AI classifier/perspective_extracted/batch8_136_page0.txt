**Perspective**

**Canada Marches On**

As our attention shifts from the
struggle in Europe to the Far East to
Latin America and back again to Europe,
it is easy to overlook developments else-
where whose impact upon our national
future may be only less great. True,
these developments are outgrowths of
the major upheavals. In that sense, they
are subsidiary. But as time passes and
they unfold, it is wholly possible that
they will loom as large on our horizon
as any of the events which immediately
concern us.

Consider, for instance, what is going on
in Canada. And it is worth noting that
the case of Canada is merely illustrative.
Canada is wholeheartedly in the war.
There is singularly little dissent anywhere.
Her expenditures are estimated at about
$3,000,000 a day. Her loans are being sub-
scribed promptly. Her industry is growing
by leaps and bounds. All this is apparent to
everyone. But what is less apparent to
most of us is what it means.

In Barron's of January 13, Stephen Lea-
cock hints at it as he projects his country's
economic future. "The figures of finance,"
he says, "lie on the surface; the reality is
below. The present Canadian financial sta-
bility reflects the fact of the underlying
stability of industry and carries with it the
newer thought that just as there are such
things as latent physical assets, so there
is a corresponding latent financial power.
It is on this that Canada is drawing, and
can draw without the slightest failure of
confidence to an extent easily three or
four times the present indebtedness.
The basic fact," he adds, "is the activity
and extent of business, and the boundless
(physical) opportunity for its expansion.
We could import 5,000,000 workers and
find plenty of material for them with
which to make munitions—till we ran out
of Germans and Italians.

"It may be said that this at best is war
prosperity and ends with war," Professor
Leacock continues. "It ought not to. As
a matter of fact, if past history presents
any parallel with present complexity, it
may be argued that war conditions often
set in motion the later machinery of peace.
The War of 1812 made the manufacturing
of New England. The Civil War enormously
stimulated in the northern states both
invention and manufacture and the utili-
zation of resources. The Franco-Prussian
War made industrial Germany—over-fast
at first, one may admit, but yet it set it in
motion."


And now observe Professor Leacock's
conclusion: "After the war," he says, "the
capital, the labor, the skilled labor, and the
experience utilized and located by war in-
dustry, can be turned into the transfer of
population, capital, labor, and machinery
from Britain to North America in what
promises to be a migration larger than any
similar known to history."

Canadians realize far more clearly than
we that after the war they will have traveled
a long stretch of the road to industrial-
ization and self-sufficiency. Every war
speeds up such transitions. The same
transfers of capital are going on between
England and Canada as those between
England and the United States. The Brit-
ish are selling securities in Canada in order
to buy on their own account. The
Canadians are shipping goods for their own
army and for their own navy in foreign
waters, as well as building up their own
navy over here. Early in the war the Ca-
nadians realized they would probably be
able to buy the control of the Canadian
Pacific Railway from the British, and they
are probably doing it. There are other less
conspicuous examples.

This is happening despite the fact that
Canada's mother country has for years
been reluctant to see the export of whole
industries. Yet there always have been
enough British willing to sell machinery,
and so the textile industry became firmly
established in India and Japan and Shang-
hai. Britain had reason enough to be
afraid, of course, for the British have had
to run their plants to a higher and higher
quality of goods to compete with the cheap
labor of the exported industries and with
other industrial nations.

For such substantial reasons the British
were, for a time, reluctant to let the Ca-
nadians manufacture either airplanes or
tanks. The Federation of British Indus-
tries at first successfully kept Westmin-
ster from sending over tank specifications.
Very much the same thing was true in the
case of planes. It is clearly understood in
Canada that the British expected the Ca-
nadians to be the source of raw material
supply, sending relatively few manufac-
tured articles—certainly nothing on the
present scale. The Canadians were to get
airplane motors from the British. So they
did—up to May 1940. Then they were told
that they were on their own.

Thus, in the face of necessity, Canada
is swiftly moving toward a greater indus-
trialization. There are those who will read
object lessons into that simple fact. But
what is plain, above all, is that the eco-
nomic and social implications of Canada’s
industrialization are enormously important
to our future. And one of the most sig-
nificant of them is that even if England
becomes increasingly socialistic in the
course of the war because of the influence
of British Labor policies, Canada promises
to be a vastly more potent stronghold of
free enterprise. We shall be glad to have
neighbors of that sort.

**Mr. Willkie’s Choice**

A glance at the headlines is enough
to remind us of how much water has gone
over the dam since election. Hoover, Lan-
don, Dewey, Taft repudiate Mr. Willkie’s
stand on H.R. 1776. They all supported
him in the campaign. Wheeler, Clark, La
Follette and Kennedy denounce the bill. In
the campaign they all supported the Presi-
dent, who offers the bill. Mr. Willkie is
praised by the same New Deal columnists
who denounced him three months ago.
Other columnists who supported him now
find in him objectionable qualities. News-
papers that supported the President are
crying “Dictator!”

And the loyal opposition doesn’t quite
know where to turn. Thus the nice idea of
22,000,000 watchdogs, with Mr. Willkie as
trainer, vanishes in a tumult of dissonant
barking. Observers must be forgiven for
feeling like the man who left a theater be-
tween acts for a smoke and inadvertently
wandered into another theater for the sec-
ond act. The plot doesn’t seem to hang
together.

So far as Mr. Willkie’s position is con-
cerned, what has happened is perfectly
clear. He has decided that his role is not
to direct the process of patient compro-
mise which the maintenance of an oppo-
sition party exacts. He has decided to
function as an independent leader of
opinion. No one will deny that he has
magnificent qualities for that role, just
as he had distinctive qualities for the
task of political campaigning before elec-
tion. There is no reason to blame him
for his choice. He has earned the right to
make it.

But it leaves the Republican party with
difficult tasks ahead. An effective political
party needs two things: harmonious work-
ing relations among its leaders, and a
group of principles to rally around. These
the Republican party must have to keep
up its end of a democratic two-party sys-
tem. And the job will not be easy because
the imminence of war will constantly make
party divisions less clear. No party can
afford to risk the fate that overtook the
Federalists in the War of 1812, when party
lines vanished for many years. If war
comes, Republicans will probably follow
the course that party efforts took from the
beginning of the war in 1917 to the ap-
peal of President Wilson for a Democratic
Congress in 1918. That appeal, of course,
ended the party truce.
