**Education and Reform**

Reformers of education are like the physician whose patients never got well and never died. Perhaps that is inevitable so long as we can never be sure of what ought to be taught and what must be learned. Hence, there is a habit of speaking of experimental education. And the most popular but precarious of educational experiments is teaching what is loosely and inaccurately called social science. To call it science is like nothing so much as calling paint art.

Back in the days when children used to spit on their slates and correct spelling was a respected achievement, our public schools started the experiment of civic education. I have my old civics book before me. It is forty years old. It is called "Civil Government." It has no pictures of model tenements, septic tanks or soil erosion. It analyzes the Constitution very simply. It explains the Declaration of Independence. It describes the form of our Federal, state and county government. And it has a few facts about law and the courts.

We were not taught then to read for volume rather than for meaning. We tried to learn what was in the textbook and measurably succeeded. Later, when I became a teacher, I tried to have pupils do the same. When I could, I tried to supplement the textbook outline with past and present examples. And now in my thirty-seventh year as a teacher, I am still trying to do just that. It is the same Constitution, the same Declaration of Independence and substantially the same form of government operating, I hope, under the same principles. The examples change and grow more numerous. But the pattern stands. I have tried to keep the pattern straight and prevent the separation of pupil and teacher by a stack of unrelated books. For a book is not a teacher, and a teacher is not a book. That's about all I know about teaching and teaching is about all I do know.

A lot of things have happened in those thirty-seven years. "Teaching" has become "education." "Civil government" first became "civics"; "civics" became "community civics"; "community civics" became "social science"; and now, I read on my sons' report cards that "social science" has become "American Civilization." Educationists thought that our old civic instruction was too dry and formal.

The teaching of what is called social science has now permeated the whole curriculum, primary and secondary. As reflected in textbooks it has come to include a mess of political science, psychology, criminology, economics and general uplift. It includes endless discussions of political and economic theory that are usually neither enlightening nor intelligible. It mixes gossip, unverified newspaper items, extracts from prejudiced reports, silly statistics and irrelevant stories. It is often inaccurate, biased and poorly written. Trying to describe and interpret as well as to reform our social life and to do this in the space of a small book written for children—it usually ends in confusion. It tries to teach something that must be learned by reasonably mature minds capable of recognizing the complexities of life. The simple fact is that a description and critique of human society cannot be condensed as these books try to condense it. What results is a series of prejudiced generalities rather than principles. The people who have promoted the expansion of social science in the primary and secondary schools have, on the whole, been sincere but overambitious. They have tried to do too much and they have done much too much.

Frequently this has resulted in the teaching of a species of socialism or statism. It is easy enough to see why. Teachers incapable of drawing fine distinctions in the world that is, turn to the easier way of portraying a world of fancy. Occasionally, of course, teachers in the primary or secondary schools will deliberately do what one history instructor at New York's City College has testified that Communists there attempted to do—rewrite history to picture men like Franklin and Lincoln as the forerunners of modern Marxism. But generally when socialism or statism is taught, it is because it is so easy to teach and to learn. It does not need to deal with facts. It is a haven for incompetent interpretation. It provides a happy but fictitious third act in a course.

I have watched this tendency in the teaching of social science for many years. I have read many of the texts used in such courses, and I have hoped for a long time that someone would point out the mistakes of fact and unjustified interpretations with which some of them abound. This has recently been done by Mr. Ralph Robey, whose comments have aroused a storm of controversy.

Mr. Robey's examination of 600 textbooks used by secondary-school children suggests how incompetently some of them are being served. It is inane to sit around decrying the man who has "abstracted" those books for the information of school boards, publishers, teachers and parents. What is important is that school boards, publishers, teachers and parents be prodded to look anew into the question of how well or how badly individual books in use are serving individual children.

What are these responsible agents to do? Well, the parent ought to read with care the books his children are studying. He is entitled to be assured that his child is not being taught to despise his political and religious convictions or the occupation in which he is engaged. The local school-board member should likewise know what is in the books for which he votes. The superintendent might go over his clumsy, unbalanced curriculum with the biggest pruning hook he can find. Finally, the teacher ought to commune with himself and decide whether he is going to be a social reformer or a social apologizer or a teacher. I hope he decides to be a teacher, for without wanting to be patronizing, I can suggest that the less I have tried to indoctrinate my students in classrooms the better able they have been to think for themselves in the world beyond school.

There are two kinds of bad teachers. The first is the kind whose activities are being revealed by current legislative investigations in New York City—the social reformer who uses his teacher's platform as a soapbox, meddles eternally in school administration and steers his entire academic course according to the dictates of a political group. He is a bad teacher not because he personally is a Communist or What-not, but because he willfully distorts, confuses and propagandizes. He is, in short, incompetent. What should concern all who truly care about teaching is not who called these teachers Communists but who called these Communists teachers.

The other kind of bad teacher is not the impassioned propagandist. On the contrary, he laughs at all things that are held precious or wise or sound or fundamental by anyone. The harm such people do is limited because the teaching of skepticism is self-defeating. Students taught only to doubt will ultimately doubt the doubts they have learned. But such a process is hardly training for life because life in the existing world is generally shaped by belief in some basic principles, even principles that have the damning stigma of age.

The cleaning up to which both the Robey report and the New York legislative inquiry point must be done in the local communities. It cannot and should not wait until national committees hand down learned reports. The responsibility is primarily the responsibility of school boards, school officials and parents.
