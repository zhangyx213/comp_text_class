**The American Radical and His Future**

by RAYMOND MOLEY

The author of the recent resolution dissolving the Communist International must have been inspired by reading American history when he wrote that the organization of radicals on an international scale encounters such "insuperable obstacles" as "deep differences of the historic paths of development of various countries, differences in their character and even contradictions in their social orders, differences in the level and the tempo of their economic and political development, differences, finally, in the degree of consciousness and organization of workers."

Tom Paine could have told him as much a century and a half ago. Paine, it may be remembered, was an impoverished Englishman whom Ben Franklin helped get a start in America. His brilliant, impassioned writing inspired the Continental cause at a moment when the whole revolution was falling to pieces. Backed by a world-wide fame, he tried his hand in England after his work was done here. He failed in England, and went to France. The Revolution there put him in jail and ended his public career. In the course of his stormy years, Paine finally learned, to his bitter cost, that revolutions are matters of time, circumstance and chance, and that no one of them is like any other.

American radicalism has been an immense conglomeration of phobias and nostrums. In New England, alone, there were scores of varieties a hundred years ago. Some thought it wicked to buy and sell; others that money was the cardinal evil; others that diet was to blame for all human miseries. There were those who were the foes of fermentation, even in bread. Others objected to the use of manures in farming because such practices "brutalized man through his food."

Out of the great West came Henry George with his single tax. Ignatius Donnelly, in the Northwest, believed that Bacon wrote Shakespeare's plays and that free silver was salvation. The catalogue is endless, from Paine to Upton Sinclair. No book is big enough to list all their names and, what is more to the point, no party has held any of them for long. Though some of their light guided a nation on its road, they were fitful flares.

To attempt to standardize or internationalize this patchwork of protest is to deny the meaning of a radical. A radical is against somethingâ€”a something he sees or imagines he sees. And the things he sees depend upon where he is.

Marx believed he could make radicals everywhere think that their enemy was a creature called an international capitalist. A lot of Europeans thought they could see the same capitalists. But the American radical never could quite identify his banker with international exploitation. The banker remained an American banker. The scrap was a family scrap.

The New Deal, of course, opened a thousand radical graves all over the country. The great crusade was clothed in terms so general that scores of isms thought they saw in the New Deal the long-delayed dawn of their day. There was something truly touching about the first visitation of these old radicals to Washington. They arrived there in 1933, misty-eyed and radiant. But what could they do? Agitate, it seemed. That was all. And the agitating was over. The business of government lay ahead. Yet they begged to do something, anything. So hundreds were accommodated.

The history of their career in government should be the most potent of all lessons to radicals. For it developed that the old radicals simply couldn't fit. Some, sick and tired of their many years of opposition, and hungry, to boot, fell into jobs of paper shuffling. Some just disappeared. Some lived to denounce the new revolution.

The American Communist party, as such, was never a formidable danger to this country in the sense that it was able to determine or deflect the course of American politics. It was too small, too foreign, too ignorant of America. We need not fear Communism, with or without the support of the Comintern, in America. The real danger lies elsewhere. It lies in state capitalism. It lies in those who believe that the industrial structure has matured to the point of senility and that the future of business will be dominated by government credit.

This doctrine presents an American issue. It is not international. It has nothing to do with foreign radicalism. It is our own fight, and we shall have to meet it on our own ground.
