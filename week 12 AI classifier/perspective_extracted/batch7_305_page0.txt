**How to Behave Like a World Power**

**by RAYMOND MOLEY**

**6-Financial Policies**

Nations in extreme youth or in
senile sunset can afford to have changeable
economic policies. But a world
power in its middle years must maintain
policies which transcend internal
political changes. We must now draw,
for generations to come, the outlines
of what we stand for in the fields
of money, credit and trade.

The Bretton Woods plan
represents, in part, what we
stand for in money and
credit. For a century and a
half there was no need for
an international financial
setup. The British pound
was the international measure
of values, and the expanding
credit of Britain was used
to develop the open spaces
in the world's economy. In
1931, Emperor Pound abdicated.
Since 1939, Britain has slipped
from creditor to debtor status.
Under American leadership the
missing factors must be replaced.

For there must be certainty and
stability in the money used in world
intercourse. The mere pegging of
currencies by two or three nations is
only a temporary substitute for
stability. The Bretton Woods plan is
intended to be a permanent regulator.
But its mechanism can be no stronger
than its major member. The American
dollar must be kept stable by the
American Government, despite domestic
ups and downs and despite domestic
pressure groups.

Our lending policies must be
directed toward practical help for both
borrower and lender. This principle
should guide not only the temporary
lending now under negotiation, but
our long-time policies as world banker.

In the temporary emergency now
before us, a long line of nations stands
before Uncle Sam's loan window.
Britain, Russia, France, China and
others are there. The stabilization of
their currencies, the rebuilding of
devastated areas, the temporary feeding
of their people and the relief of
frozen credits are among the needs
they are presenting. We may make
concessions in this emergency for
reasons of old friendship, political expediency,
gratitude for war service and
humanitarian impulse.

The British case, which is first on
the docket, illustrates the difference
between immediate and long-time
policies. The British case is stronger
than some American critics assume.
Britain's trump cards are: our essential
need of lasting cooperation; our desire
to break up the sterling bloc; our
need to eliminate the empire preference
system; our desire that the
British refrain from devaluing the
pound before the Bretton Woods
show starts.

In these present decisions
we need the assurance that
we are not financing a social
revolution; that our money
will not be used by Britain
for loans to other nations;
assurance of the reality of
Britain's necessities and assurance
that the above-mentioned preferential
measures be removed. But Britain
should also be reminded that after
her present difficulties are removed,
she also should behave like a world
power. The decisions made in these
emergency arrangements should not
necessarily establish precedents for
the long pull ahead.

After the emergency, our lending
policies toward all nations should be
guided by sound business principles.
Nations cannot permanently live on
outside help. Each must, in its own
way, build its own stability.

As far as possible, loans should be
self-liquidating. The uses made of
borrowed money by other nations should
produce the means of repayment.

No loans, except in great emergencies,
should be made for purely social
betterment.

Loans should always aim at breaking
down barriers against international
trade, both ours and all other nations'.

Loans should not be made to induce
other nations to adopt forms of
government and social life which we
prefer, but which, after all, are none
of our business.

We should expect, in partial return
for loans, the practice of financial integrity
and industrious habits.

Finally, our loans should be designed
to help our trade, to expand the use of
our goods, to create employment at
home and to keep us prosperous. For
our prosperity will be essential to
world prosperity.
