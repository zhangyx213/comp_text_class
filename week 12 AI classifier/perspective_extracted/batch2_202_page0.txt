**A Top-Heavy Party**

by Raymond Moley

The defeat of James P. Mitchell in
New Jersey proves again that success in
politics needs something more than a
qualified candidate. For if a
semi-divine authority were to have
chosen between the two men running
for governor, Mitchell would have
been favored. He had a tremendous
edge in executive experience in business
and government.

The result proved also that success
needs more than a well and favorably
known name. Mitchell was a national
figure. Hughes came from the obscurity
of a superior-court room.

Moreover, I cannot agree with
many conservatives that Mitchell’s liberalism,
which they call me-tooism, was decisive
because it kept conservatives at home. For
only last year Sen. Clifford P. Case, who is
far more liberal than Mitchell, won a
whacking victory in the teeth of a strong
Democratic trend.

The rejection of Mitchell by the voters
of the state underlines a political principle
which I have stated before in this space.
Success in politics requires three assets—an
attractive candidate, valid and understandable
issues, and active organization at the local
level. Of these three, effective organization
is paramount.

**Eisenhower’s Blind Spot**

This is why it is unfortunate that so many
Americans, including most commentators,
neglect organization in their assessment of
political affairs. This is the more deplorable
because it is common knowledge among seasoned,
experienced, capable politicians. Perhaps this
neglect of the most important factor in politics
is because it is not interesting to discuss the
prosaic business of getting out lethargic voters
at the local level. Issues and personalities make
for more lively talk and writing material.

This basic political reality seems to have
escaped the best loved and most popular
Republican in the nation, Dwight D. Eisenhower.
Perhaps this Eisenhower blind spot persists
because his life before 1952 was so far removed
from political life. Also, he won because he
was a famous military hero and despite a sadly
deficient Republican organization. That organization,
despite good times and Mr. Eisenhower’s personal
popularity, has lost Congressional elections ever
since 1952.

Occasionally Mr. Eisenhower, in speaking to party
gatherings, mentions the need for stronger local
organizations, but his favorite theme is to snare
“Democrats and independents” and to get fresh,
able candidates. He does not seem to realize that
such candidates are not likely to offer themselves
for public office if there is no organization to help
them. And also that a good candidate doesn’t
bring voters rushing to the polls. Voters are a lazy
lot and need to be coaxed, pushed, and dragged
to the polls by energetic party people in their
small communities.


**All Chiefs, No Indians**

The appearance of Mr. Eisenhower in support of a
candidate brings out enthusiastic crowds. But popularity
cannot be transferred. They like Ike and forget the
candidate.

My information about what happened in New Jersey
comes from people who were in the thick of it. The
Mitchell campaign was largely managed by the administrative
assistant to Senator Case. Case himself labored hard.
But he could not transfer his popularity. “Citizens for
Mitchell” and other volunteer groups abounded. Local
organizations were ignored. And so were other Republican
candidates. Thus it was a one- or two- or three-man
show. It didn’t work.

The same was true in New York City. Wagner is the
weakest and most colorless mayor I have known in all my
years in New York. But district workers, most of them
with jobs and favors on the line, worked to get out the vote
for Wagner.

In Cleveland, which I visited after the election, the
Democrats won overwhelmingly—largely for the same reason.
But in the counties in Ohio the organizing genius of
Republican State Chairman Ray Bliss manifested itself just as
it did in 1960 when, despite a Cleveland Democratic majority,
Nixon got the largest Republican state majority in the nation.
In all of the three spots I have mentioned, the same conclusion
is inevitable. The Republican Party has too many chiefs and
not enough Indians.
