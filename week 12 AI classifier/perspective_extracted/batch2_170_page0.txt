**PERSPECTIVE**

**Operation Beef-Up**

**by Raymond Moley**

SEN. BARRY GOLDWATER has over
the past ten years made an in-
estimable contribution to the political
life of the nation, to the cause of
good government, and to the Repub-
lican Party. He has made the word
"conservative" respected and under-
stood as a viable political philosophy.
He has also made it clear to people
who oppose the "liberal" policies of
greater and greater centralized power
and the domination of government in
our lives that their remedy is through
the two-party system and specifically
the Republican Party.
But in his attack on the Na-
tional Republican Citizens Committee,
which was formed at Gettysburg on
June 30, he showed that he wholly
misunderstands the purposes and pro-
cedure of the new organization. The
motives of the people who created
the Citizens Committee were not to
"splinter" the party or to take money
that the party would otherwise get.
Nor is the purpose to turn the party
principles toward liberalism. The com-
mittee is not concerned with ideology
but with organization. Certainly, I can
say from my own knowledge of the
individuals who are presently mem-
bers of the committee that they are
not concerned with who runs in 1964.

**ANEMIC PARTY**

The committee realistically recog-
nizes that the Republican Party is a
minority nationally, that the way to
make it a majority is to beef it up
with more workers, more money, and,
in elections, more votes. The market
for those new workers and new votes
is among the millions whose interests
and sympathies are generally con-
servative but who, for one reason or
another, are not disposed to join the
Republican Party officially. One rea-
son for their present impotence is that
in many states and communities the
official Republican organization is so
weak and so indifferent toward new-
comers that it is not getting those un-
attached people into active politics.
The way to get those people into
Republican politics is to create aux-
iliary groups which can help muster
votes for the Republican candi-
dates who are officially chosen
by Republican organizations. The citi-
zens Committee was formed to help,
not hinder, the party organizations.
Specifically, the Citizens Committee
announced that its purpose is:
"To enlist the support and partici-
pation on behalf of Republican
candidates... of those who have in
the past participated in voluntary or-
ganizations, and others who are not
active in the ranks of any political
organization. To work with voluntary
organizations presently operating in
metropolitan areas and to assist in the
formation of similar organizations in
other important cities where the Re-
publican Party is in need of such sup-
plemental effort."

**TO ELECT, NOT SELECT**

Two sorts of people and organiza-
tions are meant here. The first are
those who in specific campaigns work
under names such as "Citizens for
Eisenhower" and "Citizens for Nixon-
Lodge." They are summoned to or-
ganize themselves on a permanent
basis to help all Republican candi-
dates in succeeding elections. The
second are certain urban groups such
as are already operating as auxiliary
Republican organizations. The need
is to create similar groups in other
urban areas to operate on a round-
the-year and round-the-clock basis
over the years ahead.
In 1952 there was created in Los
Angeles an auxiliary called the Re-
publican Associates, which has been
in continuous operation ever since and
has helped the regular organization
in many important respects by or-
ganizing volunteers, holding meetings,
stimulating interest in candidates, and
helping candidates and the party with
research and other services. The Los
Angeles RA has been a model for
groups in California-in San Francisco,
San Diego, and Sacramento. There are
also similar groups in a number of
other areas over the country.
It is important to warn such groups
as may be formed that they must
make clear to the regular party or-
ganizations that their purpose is to
help, not supplant, the legal structure
of the party. Nor should such groups
take money which should go to the
party itself. In fact, such groups
should provide help in raising money
for the party and its candidates. Their
purpose is to elect, not select.
