**Monroe Doctrine Today—II**

by Raymond Moley

IN ANSWER to those who would invoke the Monroe Doctrine in dealing with the Soviet take-over in Cuba, several objections are raised. Each of these deserves examination.

One is that since we have established air bases in Turkey and elsewhere in Europe and the Middle East, we have abandoned the major premise of Monroe’s proposition that the United States would keep hands off European affairs “in matters pertaining to themselves.” Last week I replied to that by pointing out that our air bases over there have been installed with the full consent of the countries involved and that we have not in any way interfered with their internal affairs nor with their relations with their neighbors. Our installations are there for the defense of those nations and ourselves.

Another objection is that we agreed to supplant the Monroe Doctrine with a multilateral system at the Inter-American Conference at Caracas in 1954. In the agreement made there, Secretary Dulles secured the declaration that the control of an American nation by international Communism would be regarded as a threat to the American continents and would be followed by inter-American consultation and action. This, however, did not tie our hands, because if such consultation should be futile and no collective action could be secured, we could still act on our own.

**THE INHERENT RIGHT**

It is most important to understand that while the Monroe Doctrine has been inserted as a reservation in many international agreements at our instance, such as in the Hague Convention of 1907, it is not a matter of international agreement. It rests upon the inherent right of a sovereign state to protect its own security and interests by whatever power that state can summon.

One of our greatest Secretaries of State, Elihu Root, when he was Secretary of War in 1901 insisted that the Platt Amendment be made a part of the terms under which Cuba was given its independence. This gave the United States the right to intervene in Cuba to maintain a stable government there and also to permit us to have the Guantánamo base on Cuban soil. One of the first of our major mistakes since then was the abrogation of the Platt Amendment by President Roosevelt in 1934.

In 1919, after we had participated in the war in Europe, Root commented at length on the principles surrounding the Monroe Doctrine. He justified our participation in that war on European soil to help prevent another war which would embroil the whole world. On another occasion, Root said that the Monroe Doctrine rested “upon the right of self-protection and that right is recognized in international law.” Another great Secretary of State and lawyer in his own right, Charles Evans Hughes, quoted this statement of Root with approval.

**PREVENTIVE MEASURES**

In short, international law is unlike domestic law, which rests upon the consent of the governed and upon the enactments of representative bodies. Until there is a real international community—and we are far from such an ideal—those who have the power to do so must act as suits their concept of their security, their commitments to weaker nations, and in their long-term national interests.

It is a pity that this Soviet military buildup has not been dealt with forcefully sooner than this. But now we should take such action as will prevent it from growing further.

We should take our stand on the high seas around Cuba and prevent the export of matériel elsewhere in our hemisphere. We should make far stronger representations to European countries and other nations of the free world, to prevent ships of their flags from carrying equipment from Communist countries to Cuba. If that appeal fails, there is plenty of pressure available to force action by those nations. If any hostile actions come from Cuba, either against our base at Guantánamo or our ships and planes at sea, we should declare a state of war with Cuba and impose an immediate and complete blockade. Presumably, consultation with the OAS should precede these actions, but there is no time now to wait for full agreement before the foregoing actions are taken on our own account.
