Plain Talk in Politics

by Raymond Moley

ONE of my favorite thinkers and
writers is Bugs Baer. He has said
a lot of things I wish I had said first.
Recently he paid his respects to the
complaint made by some Democrats
that Vice President Nixon was too
rough in his campaign speeches last
fall. Baer says of this complaint:
"They have developed that odd
character-a crying winner."
On this, the first anniver-
sary of the "Be-Kind-to-
Democrats" week, it is ap-
propriate to consider plain
talk in politics.
I learned a lot about poli-
tics from the late President
Roosevelt and the hard-
bitten politicians who were
members of his unbeatable
team. I learned that in poli-
tics attack and more attack is not
only the way to win elections, but
it is the best way to get out the
vote and to convince the voters that
there is really something to vote for or
against. I also learned that accom-
plished politicians, if possible, soften
the blows of the other fellows by
complaining about the unfairness of
their attacks.
Good politicians really don't mean
it when they accuse their adversaries
of rough tactics. What they want to
do is to devitalize them.
And so they say that Nixon was
guilty of "smearing" the Democratic
Party by charging that it harbored
with apparent complacency a choice
assortment of subversives and other
security risks in vital spots during the
perilous days of hot and cold war. In
the same breath they accuse Presi-
dent Eisenhower of corrupt dealing
in the Dixon-Yates matter, and Secre-
tary McKay of giving away govern-
ment property and resources to evil
monopolies. Thus, they expect us to
believe it is unfair to charge compla-
cency but fair to charge crookedness.
Most of us can remember when
Henry Wallace went up and down the
country screaming that a vote for
Willkie (or Dewey) was a vote for
Hitler. New Yorkers can remember
many campaigns when the Hon.
Herbert Lehman, now one of our most
vocal anti-anti-Communists, habitually
identified the Republican Party with
the Nazis and the U.S.S.R. and
charged that his opponent was guilty

of religious "bias." I am old enough to
remember when Democrats identified
the President of the United States,
Herbert Hoover, with private business
sins and gross neglect of public duty.
The Vice President is not worried
by these synthetic outcries of the
opposition, and a definite group of
younger Republican congressmen and
senators, moved by his ex-
ample and personal influ-
ence, are planning some
aggressive crusading, with
or without Administration
support. Among them are
Hillings, Byrnes, Hosmer,
Ford, Keating, and Ayres in
the House, and Goldwater,
Payne, and Kuchel in the
Senate. The former gov-
ernor of Arizona, Howard
Pyle, now attached to the White
House, will be an effective and
articulate ally.
Such a group might well supply the
spark that would have been entirely
absent from the 1954 campaign ex-
cept for the Nixon contribution. The
1956 campaign has begun. Every
page of the Congressional Record
proves that. Radicals like Humphrey,
Morse, and Neuberger will portray
the Republican Party as the hired
minion of that old spook, "the power
monopoly," and will accuse it of other
crimes and derelictions. The counter-
attack will be sharp. It must not be
defensive. As Congressman Hillings
says, the public must not forget the
Truman Administration and the forces
and influences that flourished under
it. Crime, corruption, Communism, and
Korea are still living issues. And the
man of moderate means, the card-
carrying union member, and the
farmer must be reminded of their
stake in policies fostered in their be-
half by the Republican Party.

THESE young Republicans, says
Nixon, "are personable, smart, and
they know what's ahead of them.
They are those rare men who can go
the distance."
While I am at it, let me add that I
wonder what ever happened to those
Yalta papers which, according to my
favorite magazine, NEWSWEEK, were
to be published by the State Depart-
ment last December? And also the
records of Cairo and Potsdam?
