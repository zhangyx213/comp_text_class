**Perspective**

Last week brought the most momentous shift in our foreign-trade policy that has taken place during the past one hundred years. The President proposed a system of controlled foreign trade for all the Americas—a subsidized system for “joint marketing” of the important stable exports of the Western Hemisphere. Its purpose is to meet the threat of totalitarian penetration of Latin America.

Neither the threat nor the proposed method of countering it is new. Six years ago, when Hitler and Schacht were just beginning to show how they intended to play the foreign-trade game, George Peek and others, including myself, implored the Administration to take notice.

Reciprocal-trade treaties plus continued application of the unconditional most-favored-nation principle, we said, would not appreciably increase our foreign trade. Nor would they meet what Secretary Hull conceived to be emergency situations in foreign trade—such situations as the growth of quotas, exchange manipulation, barter and the like. For these situations, we said, were not mere panic expedients but the emergence of a new and probably longtime arrangement of world trade. They were the indications of a new system of selective foreign trade on the basis of mutual advantage. They were the final warning that the old theories about tariffs no longer had any relation to the hard facts about protecting and extending our markets.

For this, we were roundly denounced. People were made to believe that we did not favor foreign trade at all. In vain did we protest that, on the contrary, we favored more foreign trade than we felt the reciprocal treaties would provide. We were called “nationalists,” “autarchists” and worse. The President put his faith in the reciprocal-treaty method and, as recently as this spring, told the country that it was succeeding.

Last week’s proposal is notice to the country and the world that it has not succeeded and is not succeeding. And despite the face-saving statement that the new plan “is not intended to replace the program of reciprocal-trade agreements,” it is the formal abandonment of the theory on which those agreements rest.

Those who support the new plan point out that it is quite possible that Germany will make, of a large part of Europe, a union which is something more than a customs union and something less than a political federation of states. It may be that if such a union is created, a tariff wall will be built around the whole edifice. All trade with Europe will have to pass through a government-managed trade agency which will be capable of carrying on a relentless trade war in all parts of the world. It is believed that the Germans plan a world roughly divided into four trade areas—Europe, with four hundred million inhabitants; Japan and China, with an equal number; Soviet Russia, with about half that; and the United States and Canada, with approximately one hundred and fifty million. The rest of the world will be territory open to penetration by these great economic units.

Penetration means the fostering not of trade but of actual economic dependence in the area which is penetrated. It means the exploitation of an area to make it dependent upon exports to the exploiting nation. It is usually followed by military and political domination. For reasons of defense, if for no others, we cannot afford to have Latin America fall under the influence of any other imperial trading nation or group of nations. So stark reality has at last compelled us to throw overboard the pretense that the old tariff doctrines have not been shot to pieces by quotas, by exchange controls, by special exclusive agreements and by the plain intent of all world powers to stake out trading areas whose parts are complementary and whose net importing and exporting capacities alone are to be used in world markets.

The Administration now proposes to set up an inter-American trading corporation. This corporation would control the foreign sales and, presumably, the foreign purchases of all the countries of the Western Hemisphere. Specifically, this would not involve, at the beginning, more than the sale of some sixteen or eighteen important commodities which constitute the bulk of Latin and North American exports. There might be cartels or sub-cartels for these commodities in individual states. The chances are that the United States will provide the capital, although the hope is expressed that the burden will be shared by some of the richer Latin-American countries. In any case, we would probably stand to lose some hundreds of millions a year in this enterprise. The cost of establishing such a monopoly to control all commerce between the Western Hemisphere nations and the rest of the world would frankly be charged to defense. But there is the hope that we will actually build up great and reasonably permanent markets in Latin America and also develop there the production of strategic materials which we are now compelled to get from remote corners of the world.

There are the gravest dangers in such a plan. It might easily stimulate the production of products for which there is already a limited and dwindling market—just as the agricultural program has stimulated the production of certain crops within the United States. More than dependence upon cooperation by the various countries to enforce quotas and prevent “bootlegging” might be required. And this would bring us face to face with staggering political decisions.

More, it should be noted that such a plan, if set up under this Administration, would doubtless be executed by individuals who believe that American business enterprise is stagnant; that, if left to itself, private business would break down all the bars protecting labor and consumers from exploitation. Administered by them, this plan might not only be a measure of state capitalism in foreign affairs but a means of fastening the shackles of state socialism upon business generally. There has been no indication, as yet, that the projected “economic cooperation among the American republics” is to have any counterpart in cooperation between businessmen, labor representatives and government officials at Washington in devising and executing the plan. Without it, without a change in the attitude of government toward business, without practical experience and tested judgment guiding any such belated application of “enlightened self-interest,” it is apt to prove one of the most perilous ventures on which this nation has ever embarked.

In advancing this proposal the New Deal has accurately described the economic problem that will face the United States in the years ahead. In the face of vast imperial trading organizations, we cannot remain, in this hemisphere, a mere congeries of states, some dependent, some independent, some complementary, some competitive. We must, by all means, look to our economic defenses. But let us not overlook the risks we face. And, above all, let us not fail to consider the records and the objectives of the men in whose hands the conduct of the vast new enterprise would rest.
