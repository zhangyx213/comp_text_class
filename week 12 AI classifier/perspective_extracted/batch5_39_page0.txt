**Perspective**

**Lilliputian Regency**

*by Raymond Moley*

LAST week in this space I stated that, since Presidential "inability" exists, the President should either resign or assign to the Vice President on a temporary basis all, not part, of what the Constitution calls the "powers and duties" of the office. There now is no immediate prospect that such an assignment will take place.

The Lilliputians in the White House have not only woven their web over the President but apparently have successfully isolated him from the widespread public opinion that he should permanently or temporarily assign these "powers and duties."

By indirection and inference, and apparently without opposition from the President, the Lilliputians have woven painful and what might ultimately be intolerable pinions around the Vice President also. This was the order of the day in 1955 after the President's heart attack. Then, after partial recovery, the President was for months unable to decide whether he wanted Richard Nixon on the 1956 ticket. It is no secret that this was for Nixon one of the most searing experiences a man could endure. Indeed, he was often tempted to eliminate himself as a candidate.

**NIXON'S ORDEAL**

The strain of such an anomalous position, together with the fact that propriety and prudence prevent the Vice President from uttering a word or taking any action on his own behalf, is a serious matter. As the situation now obtains, he is at the beck and call of the Adams bureaucracy. At their conferences he is permitted to sit in Adams' office with the other help. His position in presiding at meetings of the Cabinet and the Security Council is merely a matter of protocol. His various assignments to represent the President at home and abroad have been merely ceremonial. As one saying has had it, he has been a "glorified Grover Whalen."

He also has been compelled to content himself with a chance chair in the vacant Cabinet room. In President Roosevelt's day that was a spot where everyone on the White House staff might confer with visitors. Gus Gunnerich, the President's bodyguard, seated in the VP's chair, used to write letters to his family. These simple ocular demonstrations of the minor role of the Vice President in the conduct of affairs of state are serious in a capital which sets great store on who visits whom, and in a world in which official prestige means so much. It is a sure way to tell foreign nations that what the Vice President says and does is of no primary importance.

**RAYBURN AS PRESIDENT?**

The nation should have a deep concern, through considerations of the national interest and safety, in the Vice President's health and capacity for future burdens. True, he is only 44 and has demonstrated incredible energy and self-control. But afflictions such as heart attacks come, under modern stress and strains, very frequently in the 40s. In the dread case of a double inability or worse, Sam Rayburn would become President, with only the public mandate of the Fourth Texas District behind him.

As far as the President is concerned, "inability" or "disability" (both words are used in the Constitution) does exist. The coronary attack in 1955 and the cerebral impairment come from the same underlying pathology, despite what the White House has said. Also, an undeclared national emergency exists.

As I said last week: "Common sense must reject the claim that a disabled President can make the decisions while a congeries of committees work out the onerous preliminaries. Decision cannot be divorced from exploration of facts, discussion, argument, and a clear examination of alternatives. The happiest solution would be for the President himself to make that decision at once."

The decision could be made known by a simple announcement, a letter, or an Executive order. Since there is a legal vacuum now in the Constitution, there would be no real opposition to such a course.

But to make this decision, the President should know the fact of a prevailing public opinion, and there seems to be a concerted effort by the present plural regency to keep him from exposure to that opinion and the good reasons behind it.
