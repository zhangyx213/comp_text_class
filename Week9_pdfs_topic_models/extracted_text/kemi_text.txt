"Shine a light on darkness." -Carl BernsteinIndeed, in a democratic system of government, shining a light on
darkness is crucial and paramount because it helps hold authorities accountable to the public and ensures that
citizens resources are being utilized.The recent expose by young investigative journalist Dan Bello Galadanci,
from Kano, has shed light on the hidden secrets of corrupt politicians in Nigeria. This feat has positioned Dan Bello
as a rising star in investigative journalism in Nigeria, reminiscent of the renowned Investigative journalist Dele
Giwa, who fearlessly uncovered the truth during the 1980s military era. Giwa legacy serves as a testament to the
power of in-depth reporting in exposing wrongdoing of military leaders and other corrupt people in the country.

Dele Giwa

Though investigative reporting is risky and difficult task, but Dele Giwa courage in pursuing the truth, even under
military dictatorship, is very inspiring and imperative. Bello, who began as a social media content creator, has
emerged as a fearless investigative journalist, willing to take on the powerful,echoes Giwa spirit and commitment
to truth telling.Although there is a little difference between the tactics used by Dele Giwa, which focused primarily
on print media, and Bello Galadanci Kano approach of revealing truth which leverages technology and social media
to present facts and evidence through the use of video clips, the impact remains significant particularly to younger
ones ,who 75% of them are on social media . As a result of utilizing social media in revealing government secret,
Bello Galadanci Kano enables the public to question those in government and easily believe in his investigative
reporting without doubts. This highlights the power of investigative journalism and the publics need for it.However
his use of technology and social media to showcase facts and evidence of the wrongdoers particularly in Kano has

                                                                                                         Page 2 of 3
                     After Dele Giwa, Dan Bello Takes the Stage -By Sale Rusulana Yanguruza

made his reporting easily accessible and believable to the public.Recently, Bello released a clip revealing that
President Bola Ahmed Tinubu to spend 15 Trillion Naira on a single project, this report have sparking public
outrage. The APC in Kano called for his arrest, but Bello responded with another video clip exposing the former
Kano State Commissioner of Local Government, Murtala Sule Garo, for allegedly misusing 280 billion naira from
local government accounts suspected to own a hotel company in Saudi Arabia.This controversy, generated by Dan
Bello fearless reporting, has put the APC leaders under scrutiny and even thier Party Leaders Pleasing the
Galadanci to stop and not continue to reveals anything to the public eyes that can set the party aflame. Hon.
Abubakar Abdullahi Dangarinan one of the APC leader organization in Kano,through the Freedom Radio Kano
appeals Dan Bello to stop From exposing thier party leaders secrets ,. Dan Bello,His commitment to truth-telling
and investigative journalism has made him a thorn in the side of corrupt politicians , creating a serious tension in
their hearts, who seek to silence him. However, his courage and determination to expose the truth will undoubtedly
continue to inspire and shape the future of investigative journalism in Nigeria.Dan Bello, now in the spotlight, has
vowed to continue exposing the hidden secrets of the APC party and any corrupt individuals in country if they
persist in accusing him. By doing so, he is reaffirming his commitment to investigative journalism and his
determination to uncover the truth, even in the face of adversity.In Nigeria today, Dan Bello Galadanci name is
destined to be etched in the annals of Nigerian history as a fearless investigative journalist. If he continues his
remarkable work, he will undoubtedly be regarded as a worthy successor to the legendary Dele Giwa, who
courageously exposed corruption during the military era. Similarly, Jaafar Jaafar expose of Governor Ganduje
receiving bribes in his office , What to always comed to People minds and you reading this article is wondering why
he stopped investigating reporting ? Their contributions is very significant to the field of Journalism Which will be an
inspiration and motivated to future "pen guys" as noted by Ibrahim DW reporter and Development Journalist.Dan

Comparative Education and a background in Biomedical Engineering. Currently, he works as a primary school
teacher in China. Born an American citizen, he is also a Nigerian citizen by origin.Primitively, his content focused on
skits that dominated social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram, highlighting the situation in his fatherland,

 The Federal High Court, Abuja, has ordered the Federal Government (FG) to investigate, prosecute and punish
perpetrators of the murder of the founder of Newswatch Magazine, Dele Giwa, and other journalists in the country.

Justice Inyang Ekwo, in a judgment, also made an order directing the Federal Government to take measures to
prevent attacks on journalists and other media practitioners, henceforth.

The order followed ruling on a suit filed on October 26, 2021, by the Incorporated Trustees of Media Rights Agenda
against the Attorney-General of Federation (AGF) as the sole respondent.

In the motion on notice marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/1301/2021, the applicant sought a declaration that the killings of
various journalists and media practitioners in Nigeria is a violation of their fundamental right to life.

This right, according to the group, is encapsulated in Section 33 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended), Article 4 of
the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights (Ratification and Enforcement) Act (Cap A9) Laws of the
Federation of Nigeria, 2004, among other reliefs.

In the affidavit, the group listed some of the journalists murdered in the course of their duty including Dele Giwa,
killed on October 19, 1986, and Bolade Fasisi of National Association of Women Journalists, March 31, 1998.

Others include Edward Olalekan of Daily Times, murdered on June 1, 1999; Omololu Falobi of The Punch, October
5, 2006; Godwin Agbroko of Thisday, December 22, 1999; Abayomi Ogundeji of Thisday, August 17, 2008, and
Edo Sule-Ugbagwu of The Nation, April 24, 2010.

Justice Ekwo, who observed that the AGF did not file any process to counter the arguments of the applicant, held
that since the group's arguments were not controverted, such arguments would be deemed to be true.

'I have studied the response of the respondent to the averment of the applicant and I find the said averments to be
generic in nature and they do not controvert the case of the applicant specifically.

'The applicant has stated names of journalists killed in Paragraph J of the affidavit in support.

'It is pertinent to note that the respondent has neither denied that these killings have taken place or that these
persons were not journalists or media practitioners.

'The position of the law is that affidavit evidence, which is not challenged or controverted howsoever, is deemed
admitted and can be relied upon by a court,' Justice Ekwo held, adding that the media is a constitutional profession,
hence, the journalists and media practitioners ought to be protected in the course of their duties.

                                                                                                       Page 2 of 2
                 Court Orders FG To Investigate, Prosecute Killers Of Dele Giwa, Other Journalists

'An Order is hereby made directing the Federal Government of Nigeria to take measures to prevent attacks on
journalists and other media practitioners.

'An Order is hereby made directing the Federal Government of Nigeria to investigate, prosecute and punish
perpetrators of all attacks against journalists and other media practitioners, and ensure that all victims of attacks
against journalists have access to effective remedies.

'An Order is hereby made directing the Federal Government to take measures to raise awareness and build the
capacities of various stakeholders, particularly journalists and other media practitioners, policymakers, law
enforcement, security, intelligence, military as well as other officials and relevant stakeholders on the laws and
standards for ensuring the safety of journalists and media practitioners.

'This is the judgment of this court,' Justice Ekwo declared.

A Federal High Court in Abuja on Friday ordered the Federal Government to investigate and prosecute the killers of
journalists in Nigeria from 1986 to 2023.

Among those killed within this period is the founder of Newswatch Magazine, Dele Giwa.

The Incorporated Trustees of Media Rights Agenda had sued the Attorney-General of the Federation seeking
several reliefs including a declaration that the killing of Nigerian journalists is a violation of their fundamental rights
to life.

The organisation also sought the enforcement of the fundamental rights of media practitioners to safety as
guaranteed by the 1999 Constitution and African Charter on Human Rights.

MRA also held that some journalists are still being harassed by security agencies with the AGF allegedly doing
nothing about it.

Delivering judgment, Justice Inyang Ekwo ordered the Federal Government to ensure adequate protection and
safety of the lives of journalists as enshrined in Sections 33, and 39 of the Constitution and Articles 4 and 9 of the
African Charter of Human and Peoples Rights.

He held that the AGF, being the Chief Law Officer of the Federation, is under obligation to prosecute and penalise
killers of media practitioners in the country.

Ekwo said, "An order is hereby made directing the Federal Government of Nigeria to investigate, prosecute, and
punish perpetrators of all attacks against journalists and other media practitioners, and ensure that all victims of
attacks against journalists have access to effective remedies."

He also ordered the FG to ensure adequate protection and safety of the lives of journalists as enshrined in
Sections 33, and 39 of the Constitution and Articles 4 and 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights.

"An order is hereby made directing the Federal Government of Nigeria to take measures to raise awareness and
build the capacities of various stakeholders, particularly journalists and other media practitioners, policymakers,
law enforcement, security, intelligence, military as well as other officials and relevant stakeholders on the laws and
standards for ensuring the safety of journalists and media practitioners," Ekwo added.

He also ordered the FG to put in place measures that would prevent journalists from attacks.

                                                                                               Page 2 of 2

 The African Centre for Media and Information Literacy (AFRICMIL) has invited young journalists across the
country to contribute to the book of essays in honour of Dele Giwa.

Oladele Sunmonu Giwa was a fiery and courageous Nigerian journalist, Editor-in-Chief and founder of Newswatch,
a weekly magazine founded in 1984.

He was assassinated on October 19, 1986, through a letter bomb delivered at his residence in Lagos. He was 39
years old at the time.

AFRICMIL is putting together a book of essays in honour of the late journalist.

October 19, 2021, marks the 35th anniversary of the murder of Dele Giwa. Thirty-five years later, his family is still
waiting for justice to be served; his killers and their accomplices have yet to be brought to book.

The Dele Giwa Book of Essays is a key feature of the Dele Giwa Annual Lecture and Awards on Courage and
Accountability in Journalism scheduled to hold later in the year.

Dele Giwa redefined Nigerian journalism because of his courage and his writing. Although there are a few books on
Dele Giwa, the first being 'Born To Run' by Dele Olojede, another gifted journalist, who was working with Giwa in
Newswatch at the time the heinous crime was committed, not much has been done in concrete terms to promote
his legacy.

The Dele Giwa Book of Essays is a key feature of the Dele Giwa Annual Lecture and Awards on Courage and
Accountability in Journalism scheduled to hold later in the year.

The essay, according to AFRICMIL is open to journalists under 40 years and affiliated with a recognised media
house in Nigeria.

Essays it said should be between 1000 and 1200 words (maximum) and submitted in Microsoft word document
(Times New Roman - 12 points). 'They MUST reflect the aims of the book.

 Sir: On Sunday, February 25, ThisDay published an article titled 'A Vacuous Judgment on Dele Giwa' suggesting
that the judgment of Honourable Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court, sitting in Abuja, delivered on
February 16, in Suit No: FHC/ABJ/CS/1301/2021: Incorporated Trustees of Media Rights Agenda v Attorney-
General of the Federation, is a futile decision.

Although the newspaper conceded in the article that 'liability for crime has no time lag or statute bar', it nonetheless
took the view that the court's decision, in effect ordering a re-opening of investigations into the gruesome murder of
the renowned journalist, Dele Giwa, more than 37 years after the incident, including the order that the perpetrators
be brought to justice, 'does not really excite many people who knew how muddled up this matter had been.'

We respectfully disagree.

Firstly, for purposes of accuracy and completeness, it is important to note that the judgment by Honourable Justice
Ekwo was not about Dele Giwa alone. There were seven named journalists who have been killed in the last few
decades and whose killings remain unresolved, that were referenced in the suit and in the judgment of the court.
However, the judgment of the court applies to all journalists and other media practitioners killed over the years as
well as journalists and other media practitioners who have been victims of other forms of attacks.

In effect, even if one anticipates some difficulty in conducting a conclusive or successful investigation into one or
more of these killings, that would not render the judgment vacuous as it offers the possibility of a successful
investigation into many other cases that have remained uninvestigated, including some very recent killings.

But more importantly, there is absolutely nothing vacuous about a judgment of a court that reaffirms the principle,
established under regional and international instruments, that there should be no impunity for crimes against
journalists and other media practitioners; and that validates the responsibility which states bear to properly
investigate crimes against journalists and other media practitioners and ensure that the perpetrators are
prosecuted and punished in accordance with the law. There is nothing vacuous about a judgment which seeks to
compel the government to perform this statutory and constitutional duty, which also constitutes an international
treaty obligation.

The judgment of the court enures to the benefit of all journalists and other media practitioners who have been
victims of attacks in the past as well as for those who may similarly be attacked in the future.

                                                                                                        Page 2 of 2
                                        Dele Giwa: Not a vacuous judgment

The court's decision reflects a commitment to upholding the rule of law and ensuring that those responsible for
crimes against journalists and other media practitioners, including such gruesome acts as occurred in Dele Giwa's
case, are held accountable, regardless of the time that has passed.

It is a commitment that should be applauded, encouraged and nurtured, no matter how late in coming we may
consider it to be.

While the Nigerian legal system faces challenges and scepticism about the effectiveness of investigations,
especially considering the historical context of Dele Giwa's case, it is crucial to recognise that justice delayed
should not be justice denied.

The reopening of the investigation into Dele Giwa's case specifically as well as other cases that may have gone
cold, provides an opportunity to re-examine these cases with a new approach, utilising advancements in forensic
technology and investigative techniques that may not have been available in the past.

The court's decision is an independent initiative, and any failures in the past should not serve as a deterrent to the
pursuit of truth and justice today.

We firmly believe that the reopening of the investigation into Dele Giwa's murder is a positive development that
reflects the judiciary's commitment to ensuring that justice prevails, regardless of the challenges faced. It is an
opportunity to demonstrate that our system of justice can evolve and adapt to address unresolved cases, providing
hope to victims' families and fostering public confidence in the pursuit of justice.

We are excited about the judgment and committed to ensuring that it is complied with by the relevant authorities.

On Sunday, February 25, 2024, ThisDay newspaper published an article titled "A Vacuous Judgment on Dele
Giwa" suggesting that the judgment of Honourable Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court, sitting in Abuja,
delivered on February 16, 2024 in Suit No: FHC/ABJ/CS/1301/2021: Incorporated Trustees of Media Rights Agenda
v Attorney-General of the Federation, is a futile decision.

;

Although the newspaper conceded in the article that "liability for crime has no time lag or statute bar", it nonetheless
took the view that the court's decision, in effect ordering a re-opening of investigations into the gruesome murder of
the renowned journalist, Mr. Dele Giwa, more than 37 years after the incident, including the order that the
perpetrators be brought to justice, "does not really excite many people who knew how muddled up this matter had
been."

;

We respectfully disagree at Media Rights Agenda and feel compelled to respond to the article so that we can offer a
different perspective as we believe that it took an overly narrow view of the matter.

;

Firstly, for purposes of accuracy and completeness, it is important to note that the February 16, 2024 judgment by
Honourable Justice Ekwo was not about Dele Giwa alone. There were seven named journalists who have been
killed in the last few decades and whose killings remain unresolved, that were referenced in the suit and in the
judgment of the court. However, the judgment of the court applies to all journalists and other media practitioners
killed over the years as well as journalists and other media practitioners who have been victims of other forms of
attacks.

;

In effect, even if one anticipates some difficulty in conducting a conclusive or successful investigation into one or
more of these killings, that would not render the judgment vacuous as it offers the possibility of a successful
investigation into many other cases that have remained uninvestigated, including some very recent killings.

;

                                                                                                         Page 2 of 3
                                       Re: A Vacuous Judgment on Dele Giwa

But more importantly, there is absolutely nothing vacuous about a judgment of a court that reaffirms the principle,
established under regional and international instruments, that there should be no impunity for crimes against
journalists and other media practitioners; and that validates the responsibility which States bear to properly
investigate crimes against journalists and other media practitioners and ensure that the perpetrators are
prosecuted and punished in accordance with the Law. There is nothing vacuous about a judgment which seeks to
compel the Government of Nigeria to perform this statutory and constitutional duty, which also constitutes an
international treaty obligation. ;

;

The judgment of the court enures to the benefit of all journalists and other media practitioners who have been
victims of attacks in the past as well as for those who may similarly be attacked in the future. We believe this to be a
very important point that the article missed completely.

;

The court's decision reflects a commitment to upholding the rule of law and ensuring that those responsible for
crimes against journalists and other media practitioners, including such gruesome acts as occurred in Dele Giwa's
case, are held accountable, regardless of the time that has passed.

;

It is a commitment that should be applauded, encouraged and nurtured, no matter how late in coming we may
consider it to be.

;

While the Nigerian legal system faces challenges and skepticism about the effectiveness of investigations,
especially considering the historical context of Dele Giwa's case. It is crucial to recognise that justice delayed
should not be justice denied.

;

The reopening of the investigation into Dele Giwa's case specifically as well as other cases that may have gone
cold, provides an opportunity to re-examine these cases with a new approach, utilising advancements in forensic
technology and investigative techniques that may not have been available in the past.

;

The ThisDay newspaper's article questions the existence and reliability of police files, raising doubts about the
feasibility of a successful investigation. While acknowledging historical challenges, it is essential to note that
improvements in record-keeping practices and technological advancements may facilitate a more thorough and
comprehensive inquiry. The fear of challenges should not be a reason not to try.

;

The reference by the article to the Oputa Panel and the obstacles faced in compelling key figures to testify with
respect to the Dele Giwa case is a valid one. However, the circumstances surrounding the Oputa Panel should not
impede the current efforts to pursue justice through the legal system.

;

The court's decision is an independent initiative, and any failures in the past should not serve as a deterrent to the
pursuit of truth and justice today.

;

                                                                                                      Page 3 of 3
                                      Re: A Vacuous Judgment on Dele Giwa

We firmly believe that the reopening of the investigation into Dele Giwa's murder is a positive development that
reflects the judiciary's commitment to ensuring that justice prevails, regardless of the challenges faced. It is an
opportunity to demonstrate that our system of justice can evolve and adapt to address unresolved cases, providing
hope to victims' families and fostering public confidence in the pursuit of justice.

;

We are excited about the judgment and committed to ensuring that it is complied with by the relevant authorities.

Dele-Giwa

ABUJA – Justice Inyang Ekwo of a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja has ordered the Attorney General of the
Federation and Minister of Justice (AGF) to re-open investigation and prosecution of those involved in the
gruesome killing of the founder of Newswatch Magazine, Dele Giwa, on October 19, 1986.

Dele Giwa was murdered in his Lagos office through a letter bomb.

The court made the order on Friday, while delivering judgment in a suit by the Incorporated Trustees of Media
Rights Agenda against the AGF.

Specifically, by the suit, MRA had sought the enforcement of fundamental rights of media professionals to safety as
guaranteed by the 1999 Constitution and African Charters on Human Rights.

Justice Ekwo held that the AGF as Chief Law Officer of the Federation was under obligation to prosecute and
penalize killers of media practitioners in the country including the late Giwa.

Apart from Dele Giwa, the court ordered that the killings of other journalists in the discharge of their lawful duties
must be investigated and perpetrators brought to book in line with the provisions of the law.

More so, Justice Ekwo ordered the Federal Government to ensure adequate protection and safety of lives of
journalists as enshrined in sections 33, 39 of the Constitution and Articles 4 and 9 of the African Charters on
Human and Peoples Rights.
