Body


A Federal High Court in Abuja on Friday ordered the Federal Government to investigate and prosecute the killers of
journalists in Nigeria from 1986 to 2023.

Among those killed within this period is the founder of Newswatch Magazine, Dele Giwa.

The Incorporated Trustees of Media Rights Agenda had sued the Attorney-General of the Federation seeking
several reliefs including a declaration that the killing of Nigerian journalists is a violation of their fundamental rights
to life.

The organisation also sought the enforcement of the fundamental rights of media practitioners to safety as
guaranteed by the 1999 Constitution and African Charter on Human Rights.

MRA also held that some journalists are still being harassed by security agencies with the AGF allegedly doing
nothing about it.

Delivering judgment, Justice Inyang Ekwo ordered the Federal Government to ensure adequate protection and
safety of the lives of journalists as enshrined in Sections 33, and 39 of the Constitution and Articles 4 and 9 of the
African Charter of Human and Peoples Rights.

He held that the AGF, being the Chief Law Officer of the Federation, is under obligation to prosecute and penalise
killers of media practitioners in the country.

Ekwo said, "An order is hereby made directing the Federal Government of Nigeria to investigate, prosecute, and
punish perpetrators of all attacks against journalists and other media practitioners, and ensure that all victims of
attacks against journalists have access to effective remedies."

He also ordered the FG to ensure adequate protection and safety of the lives of journalists as enshrined in
Sections 33, and 39 of the Constitution and Articles 4 and 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights.

"An order is hereby made directing the Federal Government of Nigeria to take measures to raise awareness and
build the capacities of various stakeholders, particularly journalists and other media practitioners, policymakers,
law enforcement, security, intelligence, military as well as other officials and relevant stakeholders on the laws and
standards for ensuring the safety of journalists and media practitioners," Ekwo added.

He also ordered the FG to put in place measures that would prevent journalists from attacks.

                                                                                               Page 2 of 2

prevent attacks on journalists and other media practitioners."
