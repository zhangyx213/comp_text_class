Dele-Giwa

ABUJA â€“ Justice Inyang Ekwo of a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja has ordered the Attorney General of the
Federation and Minister of Justice (AGF) to re-open investigation and prosecution of those involved in the
gruesome killing of the founder of Newswatch Magazine, Dele Giwa, on October 19, 1986.

Dele Giwa was murdered in his Lagos office through a letter bomb.

The court made the order on Friday, while delivering judgment in a suit by the Incorporated Trustees of Media
Rights Agenda against the AGF.

Specifically, by the suit, MRA had sought the enforcement of fundamental rights of media professionals to safety as
guaranteed by the 1999 Constitution and African Charters on Human Rights.

Justice Ekwo held that the AGF as Chief Law Officer of the Federation was under obligation to prosecute and
penalize killers of media practitioners in the country including the late Giwa.

Apart from Dele Giwa, the court ordered that the killings of other journalists in the discharge of their lawful duties
must be investigated and perpetrators brought to book in line with the provisions of the law.

More so, Justice Ekwo ordered the Federal Government to ensure adequate protection and safety of lives of
journalists as enshrined in sections 33, 39 of the Constitution and Articles 4 and 9 of the African Charters on
Human and Peoples Rights.
