"Shine a light on darkness." -Carl BernsteinIndeed, in a democratic system of government, shining a light on darkness is crucial and paramount because it helps hold authorities accountable to the public and ensures that citizens resources are being utilized.The recent expose by young investigative journalist Dan Bello Galadanci, from Kano, has shed light on the hidden secrets of corrupt politicians in Nigeria. This feat has positioned Dan Bello as a rising star in investigative journalism in Nigeria, reminiscent of the renowned Investigative journalist Dele Giwa, who fearlessly uncovered the truth during the 1980s military era. Giwa legacy serves as a testament to the power of in-depth reporting in exposing wrongdoing of military leaders and other corrupt people in the country.
Dele Giwa
Though investigative reporting is risky and difficult task, but Dele Giwa courage in pursuing the truth, even under military dictatorship, is very inspiring and imperative. Bello, who began as a social media content creator, has emerged as a fearless investigative journalist, willing to take on the powerful,echoes Giwa spirit and commitment to truth telling.Although there is a little difference between the tactics used by Dele Giwa, which focused primarily on print media, and Bello Galadanci Kano approach of revealing truth which leverages technology and social media to present facts and evidence through the use of video clips, the impact remains significant particularly to younger ones ,who 75% of them are on social media . As a result of utilizing social media in revealing government secret, Bello Galadanci Kano enables the public to question those in government and easily believe in his investigative reporting without doubts. This highlights the power of investigative journalism and the publics need for it.However his use of technology and social media to showcase facts and evidence of the wrongdoers particularly in Kano has

The Federal High Court, Abuja, has ordered the Federal Government (FG) to investigate, prosecute and punish perpetrators of the murder of the founder of Newswatch Magazine, Dele Giwa, and other journalists in the country. Justice Inyang Ekwo, in a judgment, also made an order directing the Federal Government to take measures to prevent attacks on journalists and other media practitioners, henceforth. The order followed ruling on a suit filed on October 26, 2021, by the Incorporated Trustees of Media Rights Agenda against the Attorney-General of Federation (AGF) as the sole respondent. In the motion on notice marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/1301/2021, the applicant sought a declaration that the killings of various journalists and media practitioners in Nigeria is a violation of their fundamental right to life. This right, according to the group, is encapsulated in Section 33 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended), Article 4 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights (Ratification and Enforcement) Act (Cap A9) Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004, among other reliefs. In the affidavit, the group listed some of the journalists murdered in the course of their duty including Dele Giwa, killed on October 19, 1986, and Bolade Fasisi of National Association of Women Journalists, March 31, 1998. Others include Edward Olalekan of Daily Times, murdered on June 1, 1999; Omololu Falobi of The Punch, October 5, 2006; Godwin Agbroko of Thisday, December 22, 1999; Abayomi Ogundeji of Thisday, August 17, 2008, and Edo Sule-Ugbagwu of The Nation, April 24, 2010. Justice Ekwo, who observed that the AGF did not file any process to counter the arguments of the applicant, held that since the group's arguments were not controverted, such arguments would be deemed to be true. 'I have studied the response of the respondent to the averment of the applicant and I find the said averments to be generic in nature and they do not controvert the case of the applicant specifically. 'The applicant has stated names of journalists killed in Paragraph J of the affidavit in support. 'It is pertinent to note that the respondent has neither denied that these killings have taken place or that these persons were not journalists or media practitioners. 'The position of the law is that affidavit evidence, which is not challenged or controverted howsoever, is deemed admitted and can be relied upon by a court,' Justice Ekwo held, adding that the media is a constitutional profession, hence, the journalists and media practitioners ought to be protected in the course of their duties.

'An Order is hereby made directing the Federal Government to take measures to raise awareness and build the capacities of various stakeholders, particularly journalists and other media practitioners, policymakers, law enforcement, security, intelligence, military as well as other officials and relevant stakeholders on the laws and standards for ensuring the safety of journalists and media practitioners. 'This is the judgment of this court,' Justice Ekwo declared.

A Federal High Court in Abuja on Friday ordered the Federal Government to investigate and prosecute the killers of journalists in Nigeria from 1986 to 2023. Among those killed within this period is the founder of Newswatch Magazine, Dele Giwa. The Incorporated Trustees of Media Rights Agenda had sued the Attorney-General of the Federation seeking several reliefs including a declaration that the killing of Nigerian journalists is a violation of their fundamental rights to life. The organisation also sought the enforcement of the fundamental rights of media practitioners to safety as guaranteed by the 1999 Constitution and African Charter on Human Rights. MRA also held that some journalists are still being harassed by security agencies with the AGF allegedly doing nothing about it. Delivering judgment, Justice Inyang Ekwo ordered the Federal Government to ensure adequate protection and safety of the lives of journalists as enshrined in Sections 33, and 39 of the Constitution and Articles 4 and 9 of the African Charter of Human and Peoples Rights. He held that the AGF, being the Chief Law Officer of the Federation, is under obligation to prosecute and penalise killers of media practitioners in the country. Ekwo said, "An order is hereby made directing the Federal Government of Nigeria to investigate, prosecute, and punish perpetrators of all attacks against journalists and other media practitioners, and ensure that all victims of attacks against journalists have access to effective remedies." He also ordered the FG to ensure adequate protection and safety of the lives of journalists as enshrined in Sections 33, and 39 of the Constitution and Articles 4 and 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights. "An order is hereby made directing the Federal Government of Nigeria to take measures to raise awareness and build the capacities of various stakeholders, particularly journalists and other media practitioners, policymakers, law enforcement, security, intelligence, military as well as other officials and relevant stakeholders on the laws and standards for ensuring the safety of journalists and media practitioners," Ekwo added. He also ordered the FG to put in place measures that would prevent journalists from attacks.

The African Centre for Media and Information Literacy (AFRICMIL) has invited young journalists across the country to contribute to the book of essays in honour of Dele Giwa. Oladele Sunmonu Giwa was a fiery and courageous Nigerian journalist, Editor-in-Chief and founder of Newswatch, a weekly magazine founded in 1984. He was assassinated on October 19, 1986, through a letter bomb delivered at his residence in Lagos. He was 39 years old at the time. AFRICMIL is putting together a book of essays in honour of the late journalist. October 19, 2021, marks the 35th anniversary of the murder of Dele Giwa. Thirty-five years later, his family is still waiting for justice to be served; his killers and their accomplices have yet to be brought to book. The Dele Giwa Book of Essays is a key feature of the Dele Giwa Annual Lecture and Awards on Courage and Accountability in Journalism scheduled to hold later in the year. Dele Giwa redefined Nigerian journalism because of his courage and his writing. Although there are a few books on Dele Giwa, the first being 'Born To Run' by Dele Olojede, another gifted journalist, who was working with Giwa in Newswatch at the time the heinous crime was committed, not much has been done in concrete terms to promote his legacy. The Dele Giwa Book of Essays is a key feature of the Dele Giwa Annual Lecture and Awards on Courage and Accountability in Journalism scheduled to hold later in the year. The essay, according to AFRICMIL is open to journalists under 40 years and affiliated with a recognised media house in Nigeria. Essays it said should be between 1000 and 1200 words (maximum) and submitted in Microsoft word document (Times New Roman - 12 points). 'They MUST reflect the aims of the book.

Dele Giwa: Not a vacuous judgment
The Nation (Nigeria) March 7, 2024 Thursday

Length: 727 words
Body
Sir: On Sunday, February 25, ThisDay published an article titled 'A Vacuous Judgment on Dele Giwa' suggesting that the judgment of Honourable Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court, sitting in Abuja, delivered on February 16, in Suit No: FHC/ABJ/CS/1301/2021: Incorporated Trustees of Media Rights Agenda v AttorneyGeneral of the Federation, is a futile decision.
Although the newspaper conceded in the article that 'liability for crime has no time lag or statute bar', it nonetheless took the view that the court's decision, in effect ordering a re-opening of investigations into the gruesome murder of the renowned journalist, Dele Giwa, more than 37 years after the incident, including the order that the perpetrators be brought to justice, 'does not really excite many people who knew how muddled up this matter had been.'
We respectfully disagree.
Firstly, for purposes of accuracy and completeness, it is important to note that the judgment by Honourable Justice Ekwo was not about Dele Giwa alone. There were seven named journalists who have been killed in the last few decades and whose killings remain unresolved, that were referenced in the suit and in the judgment of the court. However, the judgment of the court applies to all journalists and other media practitioners killed over the years as well as journalists and other media practitioners who have been victims of other forms of attacks.
In effect, even if one anticipates some difficulty in conducting a conclusive or successful investigation into one or more of these killings, that would not render the judgment vacuous as it offers the possibility of a successful investigation into many other cases that have remained uninvestigated, including some very recent killings.
But more importantly, there is absolutely nothing vacuous about a judgment of a court that reaffirms the principle, established under regional and international instruments, that there should be no impunity for crimes against journalists and other media practitioners; and that validates the responsibility which states bear to properly investigate crimes against journalists and other media practitioners and ensure that the perpetrators are prosecuted and punished in accordance with the law. There is nothing vacuous about a judgment which seeks to compel the government to perform this statutory and constitutional duty, which also constitutes an international treaty obligation.
The judgment of the court enures to the benefit of all journalists and other media practitioners who have been victims of attacks in the past as well as for those who may similarly be attacked in the future.

Dele Giwa: Not a vacuous judgment

Page 2 of 2

The court's decision reflects a commitment to upholding the rule of law and ensuring that those responsible for crimes against journalists and other media practitioners, including such gruesome acts as occurred in Dele Giwa's case, are held accountable, regardless of the time that has passed.

It is a commitment that should be applauded, encouraged and nurtured, no matter how late in coming we may consider it to be.

While the Nigerian legal system faces challenges and scepticism about the effectiveness of investigations, especially considering the historical context of Dele Giwa's case, it is crucial to recognise that justice delayed should not be justice denied.

The reopening of the investigation into Dele Giwa's case specifically as well as other cases that may have gone cold, provides an opportunity to re-examine these cases with a new approach, utilising advancements in forensic technology and investigative techniques that may not have been available in the past.

The court's decision is an independent initiative, and any failures in the past should not serve as a deterrent to the pursuit of truth and justice today.

We firmly believe that the reopening of the investigation into Dele Giwa's murder is a positive development that reflects the judiciary's commitment to ensuring that justice prevails, regardless of the challenges faced. It is an opportunity to demonstrate that our system of justice can evolve and adapt to address unresolved cases, providing hope to victims' families and fostering public confidence in the pursuit of justice.

We are excited about the judgment and committed to ensuring that it is complied with by the relevant authorities.

The ThisDay newspaper's article questions the existence and reliability of police files, raising doubts about the feasibility of a successful investigation. While acknowledging historical challenges, it is essential to note that improvements in record-keeping practices and technological advancements may facilitate a more thorough and comprehensive inquiry. The fear of challenges should not be a reason not to try.

The reference by the article to the Oputa Panel and the obstacles faced in compelling key figures to testify with respect to the Dele Giwa case is a valid one. However, the circumstances surrounding the Oputa Panel should not impede the current efforts to pursue justice through the legal system.

Although the newspaper conceded in the article that "liability for crime has no time lag or statute bar", it nonetheless took the view that the court's decision, in effect ordering a re-opening of investigations into the gruesome murder of the renowned journalist, Mr. Dele Giwa, more than 37 years after the incident, including the order that the perpetrators be brought to justice, "does not really excite many people who knew how muddled up this matter had been." We respectfully disagree at Media Rights Agenda and feel compelled to respond to the article so that we can offer a different perspective as we believe that it took an overly narrow view of the matter.
Firstly, for purposes of accuracy and completeness, it is important to note that the February 16, 2024 judgment by Honourable Justice Ekwo was not about Dele Giwa alone. There were seven named journalists who have been killed in the last few decades and whose killings remain unresolved, that were referenced in the suit and in the judgment of the court. However, the judgment of the court applies to all journalists and other media practitioners killed over the years as well as journalists and other media practitioners who have been victims of other forms of attacks.
In effect, even if one anticipates some difficulty in conducting a conclusive or successful investigation into one or more of these killings, that would not render the judgment vacuous as it offers the possibility of a successful investigation into many other cases that have remained uninvestigated, including some very recent killings.
But more importantly, there is absolutely nothing vacuous about a judgment of a court that reaffirms the principle, established under regional and international instruments, that there should be no impunity for crimes against journalists and other media practitioners; and that validates the responsibility which States bear to properly investigate crimes against journalists and other media practitioners and ensure that the perpetrators are prosecuted and punished in accordance with the law. There is nothing vacuous about a judgment which seeks to compel the Government of Nigeria to perform this statutory and constitutional duty, which also constitutes an international treaty obligation.

Page 2 of 3

The judgment of the court enures to the benefit of all journalists and other media practitioners who have been victims of attacks in the past as well as for those who may similarly be attacked in the future. We believe this to be a very important point that the article missed completely.

The court's decision reflects a commitment to upholding the rule of law and ensuring that those responsible for crimes against journalists and other media practitioners, including such gruesome acts as occurred in Dele Giwa's case, are held accountable, regardless of the time that has passed.

It is a commitment that should be applauded, encouraged and nurtured, no matter how late in coming we may consider it to be.

While the Nigerian legal system faces challenges and skepticism about the effectiveness of investigations, especially considering the historical context of Dele Giwa's case, it is crucial to recognise that justice delayed should not be justice denied.

The reopening of the investigation into Dele Giwa's case specifically as well as other cases that may have gone cold, provides an opportunity to re-examine these cases with a new approach, utilising advancements in forensic technology and investigative techniques that may not have been available in the past.

The ThisDay newspaper's article questions the existence and reliability of police files, raising doubts about the feasibility of a successful investigation. While acknowledging historical challenges, it is essential to note that improvements in record-keeping practices and technological advancements may facilitate a more thorough and comprehensive inquiry. The fear of challenges should not be a reason not to try.

The reference by the article to the Oputa Panel and the obstacles faced in compelling key figures to testify with respect to the Dele Giwa case is a valid one. However, the circumstances surrounding the Oputa Panel should not impede the current efforts to pursue justice through the legal system.

The court's decision is an independent initiative, and any failures in the past should not serve as a deterrent to the pursuit of truth and justice today.

We firmly believe that the reopening of the investigation into Dele Giwa's murder is a positive development that reflects the judiciary's commitment to ensuring that justice prevails, regardless of the challenges faced. It is an opportunity to demonstrate that our system of justice can evolve and adapt to address unresolved cases, providing hope to victims' families and fostering public confidence in the pursuit of justice.

We are excited about the judgment and committed to ensuring that it is complied with by the relevant authorities.

Dele-Giwa ABUJA - Justice Inyang Ekwo of a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja has ordered the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice (AGF) to re-open investigation and prosecution of those involved in the gruesome killing of the founder of Newswatch Magazine, Dele Giwa, on October 19, 1986. Dele Giwa was murdered in his Lagos office through a letter bomb. The court made the order on Friday, while delivering judgment in a suit by the Incorporated Trustees of Media Rights Agenda against the AGF. Specifically, by the suit, MRA had sought the enforcement of fundamental rights of media professionals to safety as guaranteed by the 1999 Constitution and African Charters on Human Rights. Justice Ekwo held that the AGF as Chief Law Officer of the Federation was under obligation to prosecute and penalize killers of media practitioners in the country including the late Giwa. Apart from Dele Giwa, the court ordered that the killings of other journalists in the discharge of their lawful duties must be investigated and perpetrators brought to book in line with the provisions of the law. More so, Justice Ekwo ordered the Federal Government to ensure adequate protection and safety of lives of journalists as enshrined in sections 33, 39 of the Constitution and Articles 4 and 9 of the African Charters on Human and Peoples Rights.
