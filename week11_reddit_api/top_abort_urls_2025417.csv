"3",3,"MA Experience 7 weeks","2025-04-06",1743910371,"MA Experience 7 weeks","Hello, I read so many peoples stories in the lead up to my medical abortion and they really helped me to emotionally prepare, so I wanted to share my experience too. I was 7 weeks pregnant. 

Took Step 1 around midday on Friday and experienced some cramping and nausea as well as light bleeding. I had already been experiencing heavy nausea and some bleeding in time leading up so had some safe foods and plenty of fluids nearby as well as my boyfriend with me for support. Stayed in bed and rested most of Saturday, completed some light housework waiting for the 36 hours to pass.
Took ondansetron, 4 ibuprofen and 2 codeine pills at 11pm Saturday with a light snack. 
Step 2 at midnight Saturday after the 36 hours had passed. I had been instructed by my doctor to let the 4 pills dissolve inside my mouth, after 15 minutes of this I started to feel highly nauseous and cramping. After 30 minutes the pills hadnt fully dissolved, I took them out of my mouth and vomited before experiencing some of the worst cramping and pain of my life. My boyfriend placed the remainder of the pills to the side and I spent the next 20 odd minutes releasing blood and clots into the toilet. My boyfriend noticed that despite my shaking and body chills that my head was really hot so kept alternating cool flannels on my head. Came back to bed and swallowed the rest of the pills just after 1am. Cramping intensified over the next 15-30 minutes, vomited again and released more blood and significant clots into the toilet. Back into bed with more cramping and another trip to the bathroom. Finally fell asleep around 3am, waking again at 4:30 and 5:30 with cramping and going to the bathroom with bleeding and smaller clots. 

I am writing this on Sunday at 11am, feeling no nausea anymore (a relief after non-stop morning sickness for weeks), cramping that comes and goes with relatively heavy bleeding and some small clots. I am so relieved to be lucky enough to have safe options in my country, and to have had such a supportive partner through the entire process. I hope that my experience helps someone to prepare and feel more comfortable before starting their journey. Biggest things that I can recommend is talking with your doctor, pharmacists or healthline about your concerns (ex: I was worried about throwing up the medication as it was dissolving and knew it was ok to remove the pills and take them again), being fully stocked with medications, pads (extra long night ones), bucket or a bag by your bed for vomit, and having someone you trust 1000% to be by your side as I have never felt more vulnerable.

"5",5,"MA question need advice","2025-04-06",1743901792,"MA question need advice","In November I had a miscarriage and was given medicine to help move things along. My body ended up naturally miscarrying and was told to still take the medicine.I was 8 weeks but was told baby stopped growing at 5 weeks. Took the medicine two days after my body started naturally miscarrying. Didnt experience any excruciating pain or cramping after I took the pills. The two days before was A LOT of blood and honestly a little traumatic. Thinking my body did it all on its own before I took the pills. Husband and I decided that another baby would not be the cards. Doctor decided to wait 6 months before moving forward with tying my tubes.

We had sex in March, somehow got pregnant. We decided it still wasnt what we wanted and abortion would be best. Got the pills from abuzz. They were great. Started the first dose Thursday night. No issues. Did the 4 pills yesterday night and well since then Im not sure if its working? I cramped up really bad, I did have some larger clots in the very beginning two hours after I took the 4 pills. Had some diarrhea. But since then its not enough to fill a pad. The cramps stopped. Its really when I sit down to pee. I took 4 more tonight because Im scared it didnt work. So now Im still lightly bleeding and have diarrhea. My stomach is upset. Just not confident that it worked.  I am likely comparing it to the miscarriage.

Just looking for I dont know others experience or encouragement. The amount of blood this time has me questioning if it is working.

730pm: Small clot came out. And afterwards starts to feel pain.

9pm: Super painful and a big clot came out and we thought the worst has passed.

12am onwards wife didn't get any sleep at all, painful cramps every hour until 4:45am another huge clot came out. And again we thought the worst has passed.

5am until now 830am: Wife couldn't get any sleep in as she's still having bad cramps. Tried to sit on the toilet thinking something is coming out but nothing came out.

She has changed her pads around 5 times now and I am kinda starting to get worried of the bleeding thinking she could be anemic. It has been 20 hours now and the pain doesnt really subside. She's 7 week in.

Reading other's experiences usually they're all done around 10hrs or less. Is this normal? I'm trying to be calm in front of her but deep down I'm super scared. And all the clots that came out seems too big compared to other 7 weeks miscarriages. 

She has a heating pad to help the pain. I tried suggesting some compress but that just add more to the pain..

"7",7,"MA at 12 weeks today and Im terrified","2025-04-05",1743888409,"MA at 12 weeks today and Im terrified","I found out I was pregnant 2 weeks ago, immediately booked an appointment at a clinic in a neighboring state bc my state has a ban. Fortunately I had been to this clinic for a MA once before, over a year ago and I was 8 weeks. It was painful and scary but worth it. Tuesday I went in for an ultrasound and for the pills but unfortunately I was 11 weeks 4 days, 3 days shy of being able to receive a MA at this clinic meaning I had to reschedule for an SA. 
I was scared shitless of getting the procedure done as I have a fear of surgery and needles and everything else medical procedure related. I had also already drained my bank account to pay for this and it would have been another $150 to pay for the procedure and sedation which I very much would have needed in order not to have a panic attack. The clinic is also 2 hours away which isnt so bad but I literally dont have any money after paying for this. 

All this to say, I was able to get my hands on a pill kit and after doing my own research and talking it through with a super nice lady on the MA hotline, I decided that this is the route I would take so I could not only get my money back but not have to pay anymore than I already had, and not have to make another trip to the clinic. Today puts me at exactly 12 weeks and I took the mifepristone at 10 am this morning and will take the first dose of misoprostol tomorrow morning around the same time. I am absolutely terrified of how this is going to go with me being a month further along than I was the first time I had an MA. Im terrified that it wont work at all, even though I have been told plenty of times that it will. Im terrified that if it does work its going to be a significantly more painful and scary experience. Im terrified that something will go wrong and Ill have to seek medical attention and theyll get suspicious. Idk. Any advice or words of support would help. I just want this to be over

I don't want to abort our baby, I need advice","I'm not too sure where to start but I need a lot of prayer and advice right now. I am currently 14 weeks pregnant. I (21F) myself was raised a non-denominational Christian. My partner (ex-partner) is Serbian Eastern Orthodox (21M). We are both students at university and live at home.

We were together for 9 months in a serious relationship and engaged in pre-marital sex. We agreed before having sex that in the event I end up pregnant we would stay together, marry and have more kids. For the last three months of knowing about the pregnancy, all we have discussed is this plan. He accompanied me to multiple ultrasounds and we were happy but scared about starting our lives together even if earlier than planned.

We initially discussed waiting to tell both our parents until we were ready. This last week I had to unexpectedly tell my parents I am pregnant. It was horrible timing, my partner and I were fighting and both said bad things to each other. I told him my parents knew as soon as I saw him later that day.

My parent's reaction, as Christians, was this: Everything will be ok. My partner and I need to marry before the baby is born and they will support us in any was possible for him to finish university, find a job and a house to live in. They were even saying he can live with us for as long as he needs to.

The day after I told him we were stupidly continuing our argument but as the day progressed we calmed down and agreed to stay together like we planned. My partner agreed this and he was adamant on finishing his degree (one year left) which I also agree with whole-heartedly. He also told me this was too soon to marry to which I was upset because we both agreed that having children out of wedlock is wrong.

He went home that night and told his parents. His parent's reaction, as Orthodox Christians, was this: They think I am trying to baby trap him, that me and my family must have planned this (my birth control failed). His parents told him that the baby might not even be his (it is 100% only possible to be his, and he knows I never cheated) and that they want a DNA test (only possible here after the baby is born). His parents urged him to breakup with me and leave me pregnant. They said the best case scenario would be that I get an abortion.

So he called me the next day, told me all of this and said we can't be together and that he doesn't see himself marrying me. I do not understand how his family who is devoutly religious could ever say such things, and especially say I should kill our child? Who is also their first grandchild.

I do not want to get an abortion, but I absolutely cannot raise this baby alone. I have no degree (not even close to finishing), no prospects and my parents are not wealthy by any means. I have tried talking to him outside of this but he keeps coming back to the one thing which is that he can't see a future with me because he can't see himself marrying me. I know his parents talked this into him and I know if they had said what my parents said then that is what would be happening right now.

My family thinks it is a terrible idea for me to turn up and talk to his parents, and I agree because they will most likely be aggressive and tell me to leave. Should I talk to the father from their church? My parents say they will make up lies and tell everyone I am a whore and that it isn't my partner's child.

I don't understand how these people can tell their son to abandon their child and the mother of his child, and that the best option for everyone would be if I killed our baby. Please help, I don't know what to do. I want to save my baby.","abortion",1,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jse32a/my_partner_left_me_because_of_his_parents_i_dont/"

	""	I passed major jelly like clots and bled heavily first 2-3 weeks so i definitely discarded something. 
	""	I  took a pregnancy test today (April 5) and got a faint positive. Like very faint. Which is different because when I found out I was pregnant it was VERY clear positive. 
	""	All of my pregnancy symptoms are gone. no more sore/swollen breasts, and I havent had cravings or nausea since I took the pills.

This was a approx 5-week 5 Day pregnancy, and I didnt go to a clinic. I used pills I ordered online, so I dont really have a provider I can ask. I did have a virtual check-in, and everything was said to be normal, but Im still nervous. Especially because Im still bleeding and getting a faint positive test.

I had a MA on February 8.

I was at the time 7wk/1day.

Fast forward, I thought I started my first period post MA on 3/25. Only one day I would say it was heavy (nothing concerning) as prior my period would typically be heavy day one or two. No cramping nor anything concerning 

Fast forward to today Im still spotting and pretty much have been since 3/25 

I dont know if I should make an appointment. However, the planned parenthood I went to prior to my MA was to get a sonogram to confirm I was pregnant so idk if I should go and just say I miscarried?

I had my surgical abortion today. Doc said everything went as planned, nothing that would make her suspicious of complications. I already reached out regarding this:

When I sit, I get stabbing pains that feel like theyre in my rectum. I was driving a couple hours ago and the pain was so bad it had me lifting my ass off the seat and I was involuntarily crying out. I had a small bowel movement when I got home; trying to push at all caused pain, and when I went to wipe, putting pressure on my anus caused pain too. Has anyone else experienced this?

Ive tried googling to find an explanation and havent found one other than possible complications. I get pains like this with my period but never this bad, and its only occasionally. Earlier it was like every few minutes for at least thirty minutes. Its been 13 hours since the procedure so Im chalking it up to changes in the uterus, shrinking, contracting, whatever. Ive also been dealing with some constipation during the pregnancy so that may have something to do with it as well. Id also not stayed on top of the ibuprofen so I figured that could have played a role too.

Theres no fever, bleeding is minimal. Im not light headed or dizzy. But the pain was pretty severe until I laid back down. I just got up to pee and felt the pain when I sat down. I tried to push like there was gas I needed to let out and it was that same stabbing pain.

long story short, i began passing little clots around 4 am this morning, went to the ER where it was confirmed and i was told to follow up with my OB. (dont give me any hate for going to the ER please.) 

went home at 6:30, still wasnt passing anything until around 1:45 today, i had to poop (sorry tmi) 
as i was going i felt something also moving through my vaginal canal. i looked down, it looked like a water balloon. it was stuck. after 30 minutes of pushing and moving positions to try and get it out, i decided to pull my pants up and go to my OB appt. 

i cried a lot, was scared. i told her i was scared that clots are going to continue to get stuck and that i need to try and get back to work asap (im a single mom, and self employed) and if i could do a D&amp;C. i let her look at what was going on, she gently pulled out what i had hanging there and she told me it was the gestational sac. 

i find this crazy because i didnt have any crazy clots come out prior and im still not having any large clots come out. is this normal? what can i expect to come next?

I went to the doctor on March 19th and nothing came up on the ultrasound so they told me to return in 2 weeks so that they can do another ultrasound to make sure that a gestational sac was seen before prescribing me the medication. Went back to the doctors on April 1st and found out I was 4 weeks and 6 days along.

I took mifepristone on April 2nd and started bleeding on April 3rd before having took the misoprostol. I was at my cousins birthday party when I started to bleed and passed three blood clots the size of a plum.

Today I took the first dose of (2) misoprostol tablets (200mg each) and its been exactly four hours since Ive took them and Im having the worst cramps and pain Ive ever felt. I also just passed another clot when I went to the toilet. My lower pelvic area feels tight af and the pain is radiating outward to my lower back. Currently laying in bed as Im typing this.

How will I know if the tablets were effective? Also the hospital that I went to in this country is known for telling people they need to have extra unnecessary procedures to make more money and I really do not want to have a dnc procedure since they told me that I MUST go back after three weeks for them to check and make sure I dont need one. My thought is that if I am currently 5 weeks and 2 days then it is a very small pregnancy and should be expelled thoroughly (especially after the plum sized clots). 

Also, would this count as a menstruation or not? When should I expect my cycle to get back on track?

Really sad about having one, think I am around 7-8 weeks. Been pretty emotional, wish my partner and I were in a place where I would be safe to continue with the pregnancy. Got pills on abuzz. 

I had mifepristone 36 hours before starting this.

Was really worried this morning after reading so many terrible experiences. I have today and the next few days off of work. I took 800 mg of ibuprofen (2x normal dose for me) and was planning to alternate with acetaminophen, but honestly don't know if I need to. I had some Greek yogurt, but wasn't able to eat much because I was so nervous.

Took miso orally in my cheeks about 10 mins after taking ibuprofen. I have been nauseous for the last few weeks of the pregnancy so I was prepared to vomit everywhere, that hasn't happened so far. I didn't think to take zofran or Dramamine, but I don't think I need it right now.

The misoprostol was nasty. Chalk like with a vague truffle taste??? Chugged a ton of water to get that out of my mouth fast after 30 mins was up and had the last few bites of yogurt. My cheeks are sore and feel weird. Throat is fine.

I went to the bathroom after about an hour and there was some blood.

2 hours after first taking pills I went to the bathroom again and I passed 3 clots. One was huge for me, the others smaller. Minimal cramping but I've been laying down with a heat pad. 

Honestly, am doing ok rn. I've read 2-5 hrs is the worst. So I am a little worried how the next few are going to go. 

I feel like I should be in more pain or bleeding more but again from what I've read I think I'm ok and it's progressing just fine?... Just wanted to share my experience for others that had only read horror stories.

I've had a previous SA years ago and I was about 6 weeks that time. I was honestly perfectly fine after it. No pain, cramping, hardly any bleeding, etc. This time I was 5 weeks along.
L Went SA route because horror stories about the MA absolutely terrified me. 

Last friday I went in and got it done and went home. Felt fine that night with very slight cramping, Saturday same thing, just really tired. Sunday morning I woke up to the most intense pain I've ever felt. I had chills, hot flashes, severe pain, intense rectal pressure, sweating, shaking, etc. I took ibuprofen, hot shower, heating pad, everything i was told to do. NOTHING touched the pain and I ended up going to the ER because it was so bad. They gave me a ton of pain meds, did CT scan, 2 ultrasounds, and a ton of blood work. Told me I had rpoc, a ton of blood stuck in my uterus, and my uterus was 5x the size it should've been. I needed either miso or a d&amp;c. Miso scared me again especially with the intense pain I was already feeling so I went with D&amp;C. Intense pain all day waiting for the surgery. I finally had it, woke up feeling some slight pain still but was generally okay aside from the bad anxiety attacks I kept experiencing. 

The following 3 days I had a ton of weakness, intense anxiety, dizziness, slight pain, slight cramping, and barely and bleeding. Weirdest symptom was a ton of gas. I was just exhausted so luckily I was able to stay in bed all day because my mom came to watch my kids. Felt okay so much I actually only took like 4 doses of 600mg ibuprofen the entire time. 

Thursday (yesterday) I woke up to a ton of cramping and pain but it definitely felt more like bowel than uterine. That day I had more energy but also dark red blood randomly (more like the random squirts i get on my period than an actual flow). Dizziness came back a bit more but I'm always dizzy on my period so not concerning to me. I took ibuprofen pretty consistently but didn't need it anymore in the evening so I just didn't take any. 

This morning (1 week post original SA, 5 days post repeat D&amp;C) I woke up to some cramping but it wasn't too bad at first. I had so much bowel pressure that I thought I just needed to pass gas... I was wrong. I ran to the bathroom in severe pain, gripping the sink with all my strength and silently screaming (didn't wanna scare my kids). All to have 1 small solid piece and the rest diarrhea. It was so intense I took my last dose of Norco I had from a broken elbow like a year ago. I'm taking colace because I normally suffer with chronic constipation and I wasn't dealing with that after everything I've already been going through. Now I'm terrified I'm gonna go through another repeat of Sunday. That terrifies me. It was so bad I wished I'd just fall asleep and not wake up.

I guess I have to ask, has anyone else experienced such bad bowel pain? Does it go away? How can I get through this? I don't want another episode like this, should I just continuously keep ibuprofen in me even if I feel like I don't need it?

Until recently I always had irregular periods but I lost a lot of weight which might have helped. So I fell pregnant completely by accident and could tell almost straight away as breasts were unbearably sore, felt sick and abdominal cramps without coming on my period. There was no way I could keep the baby due to a lot of financial factors and my partner having serious mental health issues with a high chance of them being passed on so I opted for medical abortion. Used the second pills yesterday 4 inserted vaginally and two hours later I had cramp and started passing blood and tissue which got gradually worse. I went in the bath as it usually helps with pms cramps and ended up passing everything in the bath. I amworried a lot about the amount and the stuff I was passing. I was only 6 weeks but what looked like a white clump came out like a cluster of stuff which I'm guessing was the gestational sax and embryo etc but it was too big it was about the size of my hand then I was passing clots for the next couple hours after that some of those were huge one of them looked like part of a liver and the other ones I'm guessing we're blood clots mixed with the lining as there was some white but the lumps were huge.

If you took your meds around then how did you feel in the morning? I know logically I should just wait until Sunday but my anxiety is just wanting to get this over with as soon as possible.

But then I started gaining weight rapidly, it worried me a lot so I took a home kit test and it came out positive.
I was so scared and I did not wish to carry the child as I do not have a healthy lifestyle, and I knew that bringing the child would only cause them more health harms. 
I didn't took any test before because I had no pregnancy symptoms at all! No nausea, no morning sickness, no sensitivity to oders, etc. It's still the same, I feel no changes at all.
So I went to the doctor's today, they did some blood test and did the ultrasound, and told me the results will come out tomorrow. That will tell me how many weeks it has been exactly.
Now I'm so depressed, I always wanted a child but now is not the right time. I decided to have them when I'm living a much healthy life.
I hope I'm not too late, the doctors suggested a surgical operation if the date passed 12 weeks. I'm scared.","abortion",3,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jrb0fm/i_think_i_might_be_at_13_weeks/"

I've been seeing a friend for 3 months, very early on she said she wanted to be with me and i was very clear with my intention that i wasn't sure enough to pursue a relationship with her and she deserved someone that was sure. At the time i couldn't really pinpoint why i didn't want a relationship but i think retrospectively it's because we were so bad at communicating and she was often passive-aggressive and unfairly guilt tripping, but in a very mild way. We kept seeing each other despite this and two weeks ago we had a condom accident.

This Monday we found out she was pregnant. I immediately dropped everything, and went to her house with the firm idea to help her get through this, cook for her, bring her to the appointment. There was a lot of very emotional cuddling and kissing because we were both overwhelmed. The day after we went through the medical abortion (first pill) where i went with her.

As the day went bye she became suddenly closed off, she dropped me at my place and went at her home. Then by text she told some of the things i said were hurtful (for example i mentioned one of my friend getting married which apparently was insensitive ??) and that how dare i kiss her after this etc, none of which she told me during the day. She said she needed to be alone, that she would never forgive me for this, that she hated me, that she doesn't want this freak show of an almost relationship.

Despite this i knew there were medical risks to the second pill, so i checked on her by text every day multiple times and called her, only when she wanted it of course. She herself was texting me 24/7 but often to belittle me or insult me, which she never did before. She would say things like ""yeah every time i see one of your message it just angers me, they are so useless and basics"". I made sure she had someone with her on the day of the second pill, even though i wish it could have been me, her ex spent the night instead.

I know this is not about me but the amount of hatred and hurt i got during these four days were really a lot, + the ex probably sleeping with her really broke my heart.

I'm honestly at my wit's end I'm extremely numb and frustrated, we weren't together but i do/did love her and i wanted to be there for her but she did not let me..

Now i have that urge to really protect myself and heal, but it feels extremely selfish and unethical to go no contact with her a few days after the abortion, even though for sure our relationship or whatever it was is over for good.

What should i do? Suck it up and make sure she is ok even though she hates me? Or protect myself?

I have not gone in to get an ultrasound to find out how many weeks I am, I know its still very early on (probably about 3-5weeks) but I have already been thinking about what I am going to do next and very unsure. At first my husband and I were excited because we felt like we wanted a child, but the excitement went away very quickly for both of us for many different reasons.   
The first two days we were excited, although I insisted we tell nobody my husband couldn't keep his mouth shut and told a few family members.  
I had an abortion about 5 years ago and my family knows about this, I probably shouldn't have told anyone because some of my family is judgemental and not pro-choice. If I decide to get an abortion again I do not want to tell them this time around, so I don't know what to do, my dumb husband shouldn't have opened his mouth but he did. The only thing I can think of (as horrible as this sounds) is telling them I had a miscarriage. My only thing with that is that I don't know what I would tell them happened, I feel like they will have their suspicions and ask me a bunch of questions that I don't know the answers to because it was not a miscarriage but an abortion.

The second question I have is again if I decide to have an abortion should I do the pill or the surgical. 5 years ago I did the pill and I feel like it was the worst pain I had ever experienced in my life, I ended up taking Oxycodone that the clinic gave me because the pain was unbearable. From what I remember the bleeding wasn't horrible and after like 24 hours I was pretty much back to normal but it was a few hours of the worst pain ever and I'm not a huge fan of taking opioids again. I am terrified of the surgical abortion though, I don't even like pap smears so the idea of the surgical procedure scares me really bad, but so does the pain from the pill.","abortion",7,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jqr4z4/28_female_abortion_advice/"

I contemplated quite a bit before creating a throwaway account to post here. We are from a developed country where despite our community being mostly conservative (in terms of business and cultural norms), abortion is legal. I can't tell my family, and don't wish to tell my friends. We had an MA performed vaginally at 4w5d, on the day of my expected period, which was very early stage, given how tiny bit of cells inside was at most 10 days old. During the scan, the doctor couldn't even find anything inside except for ""a lining"".

Every termination comes with its own story. For us, the doctor was a little surprised (or should I say taken aback) as my partner and I are engaged and will be getting married later this year. We love children and do have plans to start a family after that but...just not now. It is not the right timing with various reasons, including changes in our career. I never thought I would become that person to miscalculate my fertile window, but it eventually happened, and it was the most fearful TWW of my life.

My partner supported me in the decision to terminate the pregnancy and emphasised multiple times that this is a joined decision, not something that I decided on my own and not to blame myself for it. He assured me that at this stage, whatever that formed inside me should still be cells or tissues, not a living embryo with a heartbeat, so I should not feel too bad about killing a life. He is not the most science-y person but I know where he was coming from. However I can't help myself from thinking about the what-could-have-been. If we had kept the pregnancy, perhaps the baby could be a cute and healthy one; perhaps a year later it will be crawling around our home. When I see parents with young children, I think to myself that these are responsible parents who did not kill a life, unlike me. 

Last Christmas, I saw some TikTok videos about putting a baby blanket under your Christmas tree so that you'd have one by the next Christmas.

Im leaning strongly towards selective reduction (continuing with a singleton pregnancy) and would love to hear from others who have done the same - or just have supportive thoughts or ideas.
Im 39 and have always wanted to be a mom - I did two egg freezing cycles five years ago, just before I met my now husband. My only other pregnancy was with him - I got pregnant accidentally (after I missed three days of the pill while traveling) less than a year into our relationship, and we decided to terminate. While we were both feeling solid about the relationship and could have made it work, the timing was awful - we were about to move and I was starting a new, extremely demanding job. When we started trying to get pregnant about 5 months ago, I was a bit nervous about my age but hoped that our previous pregnancy was a good sign. I got pregnant on our third month of trying.
Since getting the positive test, weve both been happy but trying not to get ahead of ourselves- knowing how common first trimester miscarriage can be, Ive just been focusing on taking care of myself, not personifying the fetus too much, and hoping for positive early test results. I found an OB/midwife practice I really liked, and they explained that the two big testing milestones in the first tri would be the dating and visibility ultrasound at week 6-8 and NIPT (blood testing for major chromosomal abnormalities) at week 10-12. 
At the dating and viability ultrasound yesterday (7 wk 3 d), we learned it was healthy fraternal twins. Multiples dont run in either of our families so we hadnt even considered this. I immediately went from cautiously excited to extreme anxiety and despair. I dont want to carry or birth twins, and we dont want two babies. After lots of discussion, we firmly decided a long time ago that we plan one and done. If we always planned for two, Id probably be happy (along with freaked out), and ready to make it work. But for financial, logistical, family, emotional, and simply preference reasons, we want one child. Every time I think about carrying forward with the twins, I feel panic, dread, and resentment that Im being robbed of the joy of anticipating my first baby.
Assuming I get through the first trimester and the NIPT is normal, Im strongly leaning towards elective termination of one fetus. My husband is on board - hed be ready to go in either direction, but ultimately prefers the one kid plan and more importantly, wants me to feel good about our plan.
Has anyone done this and can shed light on the experience - finding and working with a provider, the procedure and recovery, the remainder of the pregnancy and birth? (Im in NY). Even if you havent, can you recommend any resources for me? This seems unusual and other than my husband, Im feeling alone.","abortion",18,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jq7vmb/strongly_considering_selective_reduction_of_twins/"

I'm a sea ice researcher based in the U.S., and I just found out Im about 6 weeks pregnant. Im scheduled to leave next week for a remote fieldwork trip in Greenland, where Ill be collecting sea ice samples for about a week. Its obviously a cold environment, but well be staying at a heated research station with warm rooms and bathrooms.

Id really like to take both mifepristone and misoprostol before I go, but that would only give me about 3 full days to recover before my departure. Im worried about bleeding, cramping, or complications flaring up while Im out in the field, even though conditions at the station are relatively comfortable.

The alternative is to wait until I return, but Id be around 89 weeks along by then, and Im scared the experience might be physically harder or more emotionally intense. Im torn between minimizing symptoms during fieldwork vs. getting it over with now and possibly pushing through recovery during travel.

Has anyone had a medical abortion around 6 weeks and felt okay after a few days? Or waited until 89 weeks and found it manageable? Id love to hear from folks with similar timing, especially if youve dealt with recovery in more rugged or remote conditions.

(i'm 19 btw please go easy on me). starting off i was in a year long relationship, this man was the love of my life, i would always rave about how kind hearted he was, how well mannered, loving this man was. (you'll understand why im mentioning this all later). we definitely had some ups and downs, i think towards the ending of our relationship is where it got really bad because he has always lacked emotional intelligence/ maturity. i've always been very vocal about my feelings and to him im assuming it was overwhelming. he puts logic over feelings always. fast forward, i found out i was pregnant. 

finding out i was pregnant was BY FAR the biggest shocker of my life because i NEVER thought it could be me. you know those select friends that you just never see having children, (especially this young) yea i was that girl. i have motherly traits and i LOVEEEE kids but i never thought it would be me so young. fast forward i told him and i could just tell by his response that i was about to be in for a ride because his energy towards me changed SO quick. like insanely quick. he didn't do much comforting but i give him grace for that ONLY because i understand how shocking and scary it was for him too. but instead of consoling me and making sure i was okay, he asked me what i wanted to do. now in any regular instance this would've been the norm right? but knowing him it was more of a way to tell me to abort it without telling me. when i mentioned that i wanted to keep it but maybe abortion was the best option given our circumstances at the moment he said ""ok let's go today"". this was the first day of me finding out btw. he didn't even allow me to process anything. of course pregnant and emotional me got a little upset because i felt like he was just being so insensitive. fast forward to the next day, we had a convo again about what i thought about doing and i was still very indecisive because this was all so fresh and i honestly wanted my baby. my dream has always been to be a mom (obviously not this young but shit happens. DO NOT BE LIKE ME, ITS SO MUCH EASIER TO PREVENT PREGNANCY WE WERE JUST BEING DUMB). but yea when i made it known that i was thinking about keeping it and what my plan was, he called it stupid, selfish, and basically saying i dont have what it takes. basically scolding me for wanting my baby. i try to reason with him and give him grace because in his eyes it was just logical, but with a baby involved its so much more than that. either way my life changes drastically forever and it wouldn't even affect him in the slightest because he didnt want the baby. (he said that word for word by the way, he did not want it). on the 3rd day of me knowing is when we told our parents and i was right next to him when he told him mom on the phone, the whole conversation just was surrounded by the fact that she had an abortion and it wasn't that bad, nothing else so clearly that's what she wanted me to do (am i crazy for thinking that?) she also stated that if i have the baby just know she doesn't have space for a baby. that whole convo just rubbed me the wrong way because as a POTENTIAL grandmother, why is that the main concern, i'd never burden anybody with what i have going on especially my child. i have my own space thank you very much. anyways we cried, he did hug me and try to console me in the moment. fast forward to later that day, his texts to me were getting shorter and shorter and he just seemed overall bothered by me. now it is my fault for assuming but again i was highly emotional and he has never gave me the cold shoulder like this before. so i expressed to him that i felt alone 

i think as humans we all feel alone sometimes even when we have people claiming to be there you know? i think i felt alone in a sense that, nobody knows or could fathom what im going through especially him so it was hard for me to get through to him. and again he wasn't very sympathetic towards me. we got into a fuss about it and then boom....

he sends me a text saying that if i have this baby me and him can't coexist, that he won't follow me into the pits of hell, that he won't allow me to ""pull him into the struggle"" and that i'm ""dead to him"" all i am to him is his ""baby momma"". THE RAGEEEE THAT I FELTTTT I WILL NEVER FORGET. yall it was so bad i legit quit my job that same day because the emotions took over and i could not be at work without balling my eyes out. the betrayal that i felt, the anger, the sadness, the confusion? it all just took over me. he called me troubled because i ""only think about myself"". seeing what he said honestly broke my heart entirely and now ultimately i had to make am extremely hard decision. i wanted my baby so bad. so so so bad. it was either keep my baby and go through the sadness and depression from being alone my entire pregnancy, possibly develop ppd &amp; have to possibly be a single mom, or go through with my abortion that way my child didn't have to be born into chaos. looking back i would've went through it all just to see that little face :( but ultimately i had to love my baby enough to let it go. i grew up with both parents but they NEVER got along and i experienced SO much trauma and i hold a lot of resentment because of that. i'd never want my baby to deal with that. i also knew i couldn't do it on my own and unfortunately i don't have a big family or support system so it would've been extremely hard and although i know i was capable of doing it, i didnt want my baby to have to watch me struggle. i didn't want my baby to grow up and feel like he or she was a burden to my life. it feels like i chose him over my baby but i know deep down i did it because i didn't want to raise my child with someone like that. anyways the crazy part is he convinced himself that we are in this position because of me, that the reason this all happened is because i cannot control my emotions and that im too emotional. like wtf, you broke up with ME. you got scared, you were a coward and left ME because you couldn't take accountability and step up. this man blamed me for how this whole shit went down and it's really mind boggling how someone will really try to gaslight you. like i really had to sit back and think and i'm gonna be real guys at first i even APOLOGIZED to him for what he did to ME. 

and the worst part is my dumbass was so sad to have lost my baby and him, that i tried to rekindle things with him. he asked if there was ever a chance for us again and i told him possibly with a lot of conversations, apologies, and accountability involved and then he changed his mind and told me i'd basically have to wait for him to be ready to jump back into a relationship. MEEEE wait for YOUUU? i'm not with the whole ""i hate men"" propaganda but i swear to god yall make it so hard for me not to. anyways i can't blame him for that, i blame myself because my self respect was so low that i was willing to disregard everything he did to me to be in a relationship. i know my baby is disappointed in me and im disappointed in myself. i've lost myself entirely. i'm so depressed. i don't  want to get up to do anything, i barely speak to anyone anymore. i rot in my bed and cry all day everyday. i'd do anything to get my baby back but i have to learn to accept it and move on. hopefully im strong enough to move past this because i honestly don't even wanna be on earth anymore.

anyways thanks for reading, i doubt some of you will read all this lol. i know im writing to a bunch of strangers but i would really appreciate it if you guys prayed for me. it would mean a lot. and if you see typos or improper grammar mind your business Lol

Back story; 
I was roughly 7 weeks and 4 days pregnant, on January 16th I took 1 mifepristone, waited 24 hours, and on January 17th I took 4 misoprostal pills at 6pm. After taking the miso, I took ibuprofen and laid down. I woke up around 9pm that same night with bleeding that was slightly heavier than a period, blood clots, and a very small clearish sac present within the blood and blood clots. ( I had a miscarriage in August of 2023, I was 10 weeks pregnant but the pregnancy stopped progressing around 7 weeks, it seemed about the same as my miscarriage minus what felt like contractions at the time of my miscarriage. ) I took another 2 miso around the time I woke up as directed, and another 2 3 hours later as directed. The bleeding lasted until January 27th, towards the end it was extremely light. 

Fast forward to March 15th, I had very light bleeding for 3 days. Nothing close to what I expected for a first period. Not even enough to even stain a pad, very light red almost pink blood. After the 3 days, I havent experienced any more bleeding. I am now expecting my 2nd period post MA, and have been feeling extremely bloated, Ive had bad acne which is new for me, and Ive had back and side cramps.

I want to start this off by saying I don't necessarily regret getting an abortion. But ever since I had it (2 months ago today) I've been struggling greatly with processing it and mourning the child I could've had. Like I said I don't regret it as I know it was the best thing to do for me in my current situation. But I've always dreamed of being a mother and nothing excites me more than the idea of me and my fiancé expanding our little family. We just couldn't afford to do so right now I mean we can barely afford the 2 of us. I'm in school working at a minimum pay job and he's in the military and could easily be plucked up to go somewhere for however long and I know I'd rather wait until me and him are more stable and some other things. But when I found out I was pregnant no part of me was sad and now I can't even see a pregnant woman or a baby without getting emotional and wondering what could've been. I think about it every night before bed, I still hold my stomach like I have a baby in there, I unintentionally track how far along I would be (like when I look at the date of each day I'm like oh today I would've been this many weeks). and this is something I've talked about with my fiancé and he does his best to support me but I know he doesn't feel the same about the situation which I totally understand but I really just can't figure out how to cope and it's been so exhausting. Our friends just had a baby and they want us to come over at some point and I'm just dreading it because I know it'll be so devastating for me and that isn't fair to anybody at all. I just miss the baby I had in my belly and how close I was to having motherhood. If anyone has felt the same or knows some things that might help me cope a bit better please please let me know.

So long story short Im a boyfriend of 2 years sitting in the waiting room of a planned parenthood for a presumed medical abortion, but well see about the specifics I suppose. 

Basically my girlfriend was inconsistent in taking her birth control in part because of some emergency travel and we werent thinking.

She already has very inconsistent periods and we didnt think much of it until she was spotting and her sex drive was substantially lower. Turns out - shes pregnant. At the time of writing this - we guess shes somewhere between 4-9 weeks. We had already discussed what we would do should this ever come up and there were no surprises about her desire to get an abortion.

In the past Ive only ever been with partners who are significantly more experienced and who had taken birth control since they were in middle school / high school. As a result Ive basically just been blissfully ignorant of this entire process. 

Im ashamed to admit that I had no idea how difficult and painful this can be for women physically (the mental struggles I can understand) and reading these stories has me taking this much more seriously. Which is good! Of course Id take whatever she said seriously, but my expectations were clearly far off. 

With all that in mind - how can I be the best boyfriend I can be? 

Snacks? Pain killers? Gatorade? We dont live together at the moment (she lives with family, but I have my own place that shes always welcome to and has keys), but I believe she plans to take the pills and go through initial experience at her home. 

Since I likely wont be able to be with her physically Im just trying to do whatever I can - any advice is appreciated.

I've talked to my husband as much as I can, but he just simply cannot relate. 

It's been just over 2 weeks since I took the pills for MA, no prior ultrasound to confirm length of pregnancy, only one doc visit to confirm the pregnancy at all. 

I took the pills according to the packaging, I immediately was bleeding, cramping, passing small clots, which I figured was normal for being around 7-8 weeks based of LMP.

Two weeks later and I'm typing this from the ER, I saw the chunks in my uterus and it's looking a lot like I'll be having a D&amp;C which is my worst nightmare, I purposely chose MA over SA and now it's looking like I should've just went that route and saved myself. 

Honestly, I just feel stupid right now, I regret not pushing for an ultrasound before having the abortion, partly to see it, even if it was just a black circle, but also to confirm gestation. 

The thing is, I've always wanted kids, I mean, some of my first memories are with baby dolls or with barbies and there were ALWAYS heavy themes of being a mom/parent in any game I played that I could do it in.
To say I want kids is an understatement, and the older I get, the more soul crushing life has been in the sense that kids just haven't been a option for us. 

It certainly tracks for how my life has gone that this would be how I'd get pregnant, and then having to terminate for the sake of the child and the life it would have to live over my irresponsiblity. 

I know the suicide Hotline prevention number and the whatnot, don't need that info, just needed someone or multiple someone's to tell me I'll be OK and give me a reason to have a will to go on. Since starting the abortion process I won't say I want to kill myself, I will say, I've thought about it, thought about how I could do it, but I won't, if nothing else, I have a dog who loves his mommy more than any other human and he needs me, I also have a very supportive, amazing husband who has been at my side through all this that doesn't deserve to mourn his wife this young because life isn't going the way she wants.

(I didnt test immediately after missing my period as I did get 2 days of spotting and cramping, I just assumed it was because I recently got into weight training and my period was frequently changing or late)
Upon my call to the clinic, I first had to get an ultrasound to confirm how many weeks I am. I had my ultrasound this morning (both abdominal and internal because I didnt drink enough water.

Anyways, the nurse told me I have to go back to the hospital IN TWO WEEKS on the 23rd for blood work and an appointment at the clinic for the pill prescription. Does this not seem incredibly late?

I had an unwanted pregnancy and things became very toxic which I cant discuss with anyone else other than him so I constantly kept reaching out to him to discuss and he was rude and mean to me during entire this process. I started having this anxiety issue post I terminated the pregnancy.

I have this abandonment issue where I get paranoid if someone blocks me, I go crazy. I have taken therapy but it didn't help me. I ended up calling that person who he blocked me everywhere after one week of abortion and I requested him to unblock me. He said ok fine he will do it but I am not supposed to text him at all else he will block me again. I am feeling I have no self respect left post this. But I feel so helpless that I cant function if someone abandon me that is too when I am dealing with things like abortion. Please help me. I have no feeling left for this person but I cant bear getting blocked. he was very rude to me entire time we were discussing and he said I am being too immature and what kind of person I am to request someone to do this to me. He didn't even check in on me post I came home and he blamed his behavior on me saying I said him ugly things in the anger so he cant forgive me. 

I need help for sure but I have taken therapy for the longest time and I am never able to heal my abandonment issue. I cant stand someone leaving me so I need to be unblocked even if its costing me my self respect.  feel embarrassed. But my anxiety is more than my self respect.

This babys father is my ex who I have a restraining order on last year for DV &amp; hes still going to court for it. He was around for the second half of my pregnancy in 2023. We hooked up a random night in February after months of no contact and here we are. He has no children, I have 4 (3 with my ex husband, 1 with my short term bf at the time, and this one). I already have all 4 by myself. My mom isnt speaking to me because she despises him and to an extent I dont blame her but whats done is done. He is a drug addict, c0ke specifically and thats what makes him lash out. He lives with his mom &amp; has no car- his mom lets him use the farm truck but he cant put aside $$ for a car because he does online gambling and c0ke. Hes cheated on me in the past when we were together so he thinks now Im trapped with his child and well be stuck forever &amp; he thinks we will be back together at some point. A baby doesnt make a man stay or a woman either. 

 When I found out, I ordered the pills (Im in a state that it is not legal). I always will &amp; have loved him but hes an addict who refuses to get help. We are toxic and I dont want to be stuck raising another child by myself. Its his first biological child and hes told his family. My other kids are excited but Im depressed, severely. He has multiple women he talks to and I doubt he ever changes so my idea of family is out the window. 

I dont know what the right choice is and Ive been going back and forth since 4 weeks, Im 8+3 now. I could take the pills and be done and have my freedom back &amp; have a chance to find someone who actually loves me and not just says that- and it sounds great but Im worried about the regret. I just had an ultrasound and it wiggles and everything now. Its the hardest choice Ive ever had to make. Part of me wishes I could just take the pill and say, well, its too late to go back now. Im scared of the pain or if I pass out- its just me and my kids here. Im scared of the regret. I dont feel like he deserves this child and either way - regret from this or dealing with him for 18 years- my mental health wont be good. The reason I go back and forth is because I have hope maybe someday hell change. What if he comes to his senses and gets help, and thats exactly it&.what if. I can do it by myself its just hard. I was finally getting to a good place in my life and Im scared Im going to downward spiral. 

Im not sure what Im looking for. Maybe experiences from people who have been in a similar situation &amp; dont regret it or if you do. Hormones play a part, Im sure, but my mental health has rapidly been declining because of this baby and the stress associated with it. I dont know what the answer is and Im in a time crunch.

I'm a 23F married to 22M with a 10mo little one already. I am a SAHM and rely on our husband's income as I stay with our baby. My baby was born May '24. I threw a positive on March 18. I stupidly told my husband and a trusted friend, but had I known getting abortion access would be this easy I would not have. There is a combination of factors why I didn't want another baby, main ones being I feel like a married single mom enough as is, finances, extreme difficulty giving birth, HG diagnosis with last pregnancy (I was still throwing up in active labor if it says anything). Physically, my little body is still worn out from the baby I had just had 10 months old ago. I was just starting to feel like myself again when my world seemingly started to come crashing down on me.

My husband is very conservative and would not even entertain or hear the idea of an abortion. I am having to keep a secret from him, as well as my best friend. Which is pretty difficult from me since Im a shit liar.

I went to google and was somewhat shocked at how easy it was to get care. After Roe v Wade was overturned, I figured I'd have to resort to some sort of underground black market for these things. I am thankful that there are people out there putting their lives and livelihood on the line for people like me. Anyways, here's my MA story and experience with Abuzz.

Tuesday, March 19:

\- Submitted Abuzz form and payment, awaiting approval

Wednesday, March 20:

\- Notified thru the portal my form was accepted, was sent an instructions link &amp; got a tracking link for my shipment the same day. They estimated me to be 4wks and 3 days, although I could tell you the exact day I conceived.

Monday, March 24:

\- Package arrived around 12:30pm

\- Took mife at 12:36pm, no real symptoms other than just being bloated the rest of the day. I was 5wks this day.

Tuesday, March 25

\- When using the bathroom and wiping, I was beginning to notice a tinge of brown when I wiped on the tp.

\- Took premeds (ibuprofen 600mg, tylenol 1000mg, and phenergan) I had at 11:37am. No where on the instructions does it indicate to pre-medicate, but after having an unmedicated birth much against my displeasure (2 failed epidurals) I am a HUGE sissy when it comes to pain.

\- Took miso at 12:44pm, took it around 12 mins 30 secs to dissolve in my mouth so I was done with it after 12:57pm. Highly reccomend having a flavored drink nearby to wash the chalky taste out of your mouth.

\- Got up around 1:15 to go get a jacket from another room since I was starting to chill a little bit, felt a bit sore n crampy when I stood up but nothing I couldn't walk off.

\- Went and peed around 2:05 and a small grape sized clot came out. No real pain or discomfort at this time since I am pretty well medicated. Kind of gassy.

\- Explosive diarrhea around 3:45pm and some breakthrough cramps, I imagine my meds are beginning to wear off around this time

\- More explosive diarrhea around 4:30, my cramps are still pretty light

\- Passing a few stringy clots but nothing major, still bleeding moderately. My cramps are intermittent and I took more Tylenol around 6pm. It is 8:45pm now.

Wednesday, March 26

\- Took a second dose of miso upon providers instruction at 12:45pm

\- Swallowed the remaining bits at 1:15

Thursday, March 27

\- More noticeable bleeding today

Tuesday, April 1st

\- I have bled pretty moderately for a week, but going on day 8 my bleeding is slim to none. Just kind of annoying, like the end of your period.","abortion",2,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jui50i/my_ma_at_5wks_abuzz_experience/"

I found out I was pregnant while talking to a nurse, and I have not gotten the chance to speak to a counselor or doctor at any point, leaving me unsure on how to proceed with my abortion. 
To make matters worse, the medicinal clinic Im assigned to is extremely bad and forgot to refer me to the hospital for about a week, although they told me it had to be as quick as possible, which has been super stressful, because I from the get go thought a medicinal abortion (not possible after week 9) would be the best and safest option, considering it seemed more natural and also perhaps more comfortable - letting me do it at home and not getting my boundaries overstepped (I am very self aware of my body, and I dont know how Id react to someone touching and seeing me, who Im not comfortable with). 
However, I started reading up on the differences between medicinal and surgical abortions and to be honest, the medicinal abortion seems very intense, painful and long, while the surgical seems fast and painless, since its also under anesthesia. 
My mom also mentioned how it might be a possibility to get an IUD inserted while theyre already doing the surgery, which would be amazing while being under anesthesia. 

(^ Ive been scared of getting proper prevention because :
- Pills wouldnt work for me, as I have adhd and often forget things
- IUDs scares the everliving shit out of me both bc of my self awareness issues, and because of other peoples experiences of getting it inserted) 

Sorry for making this a long rant, but Im super stressed out and I hope you guys have some good recommendations on which kind of abortion would be the best choice and perhaps share your own experiences so I am better prepared for what Im about to face.

 Im gonna try to say all of this without I guess making it super long. I also am in the state CA, so I have done a few researches on abortion for my state so I have time. 

Basically I am 15 weeks pregnant with a baby boy. I was so excited to be pregnant &amp; be able to grow a family with my boyfriend soon to be hubby! Id like to first say that we do not live together anymore as I used to live with him &amp; his family but I cannot live there because they smoke weed &amp; cigarettes in the house everyday &amp; its filthy there. &amp; no , I do not smoke or do drugs if that nature. But when you walk into their house its like a trap house. Theres barely any furniture &amp; most of their money goes to weed &amp; cigarettes. My boyfriend also has a sister who steals a lot &amp; just got recently arrested for stealing.. So, I decided to move out &amp; live with my mom because of that as I felt it wasnt a good environment to put myself &amp; even the baby in. Well his mom would always make weird comments.. I guess  I should first say when we first got together she used to tell me youre blessed to have him because I raised him good or she would tell me I know him better than you.. but I always thought that was odd &amp; told him but he never really said anything about it. But I found out I was pregnant &amp; now shes told me how Im not gonna matter anymore only the baby &amp; how the baby will like her more than me.. how shell take me to court for custody if I decide to take away her baby..like??  then she wants to throw a baby shower which I mean I said okay because idk I know shes excited but then she wants to make it this huge thing &amp; it is but Im just overwhelmed. Then when I found out the gender I wanted to do an intimate gender reveal so just having my bf &amp; I doing one &amp; it was a problem for some of his family members &amp; then my boyfriend told his parents of course but then his mom went &amp; told everyone else before we could.. I dont know. &amp; we also had a family dinner but it was for his aunt whose been out of town or whatever &amp; SHE wanted a family dinner to see everyone &amp; it was my first time since finding out I was pregnant being in a restaurant let alone in public because Ive had terrible morning sickness. She decided to tell everyone the news. Shes texted to ask to have pics of the ultrasound so she can frame it for herself. I thought that was odd too..but idk bc then my bf said she framed it for him &amp; his sister but I was like ?? But it isnt her baby?? &amp; he told me shes just excited to be a grandma. Omg before anyone asks yes I go to my boyfriend about it all the time for him to defend her all the time saying shes just excited shes not trying to hurt your feelings but like ??? I keep telling myself that but then Im the one upset &amp; crying all the time. I dont want to get between him &amp; his mom but I dont even know anymore. Im crying while typing this because I feel so sad that I no longer want to even be pregnant just because of how bad my experience has been.. On top of that Im crying every single day stressing because its took such a toll on me &amp; I also wanna say my boyfriend &amp; I get into arguments almost everyday now because of everything. Its to the point where I dont want to even have a baby anymore because I feel wrong for bringing him into a life like this. Its even scarier because they continue to say theyre going to have my baby no matter what if Im keeping him away from them. So unfortunately its been on my mind lately to get an abortion because I do not want to be with my boyfriend anymore &amp; I do not want to give this baby a life like that. Especially when it seems like everyone claims this unborn child. I also fear that since co parenting will most likely be a thing that they will teach him the wrong things..

I had a successful MA on Sunday 16th March. My bleeding has been finished for a while now, and my special test that I got from the clinic to take three weeks after was negative, so everything went successfully. On Sunday 6th April (literally exactly 3 weeks after the MA) I unfortunately had unprotected sex (and am completely spiraling over it.) I am not on any form of birth control which I know isnt the best. I really dont know what my plan of action should be here because theres obviously no accurate way to predict when my ovulation occurred, if Im ovulating or what point in my cycle Im in at all. In a spur of the moment freak out after I had sex yesterday I had taken one of the Desogestrel birth control pills I was given at the clinic. I know this was really stupid as that is obviously not a form of contraception, I was just trying to make myself feel better (pointless as I hadnt been taking them consistently.) I worry that I might have shot myself in the foot as now I dont know if I can get the morning after pill, if the birth control pill will reduce the efficiency. Im essentially just really concerned now that I may be in my ovulation period (as I said because there is no way to predict this), so who knows if getting the morning after pill would even help anyway. I feel like 3-weeks post MA is a perfectly reasonable time to expect ovulation which is freaking me out even more. I dont know what Im looking for in posting this but Im just kind of having a freak out and beating myself up, anyone have any advice or guidance? Should I get a morning after pill?

Im really struggling and feel incredibly conflicted sharing this. I worry that my story will come across as ungrateful, especially given how hard so many people fight for the chance to conceive. But I need to speak openly, because I feel so alone.

First, I want to say how deeply grateful I am to have had access to NHS-funded fertility treatment. I have so much respect for every woman who goes through this journeyits emotionally and physically intense.

My partner and I began IVF in late summer last year. Egg retrieval went really well, and our first frozen embryo transfer was on the 11th March. To our joy (at the time), it resulted in a pregnancy. Im currently 6 weeks and 4 days.

But heres the truth: I feel absolutely no connection to this pregnancy. No joy. No bond. Instead, I feel regretlike I made the worst decision of my life. I know how awful that sounds, and I cant explain what changed or why I feel this way. Im 34, turning 35 this year. Im in a loving, supportive relationship of 5.5 years, and were financially stable. On paper, everything looks right. But inside, I feel like Ive destroyed my life.

I even had a private scan at 6 weeks. The baby looks healthy, with a strong heartbeat. I thought maybe that would help me feel somethinghope, connection, even awebut it didnt. I walked out still feeling like I didnt want this.

Has anyone else felt this way? Did it change? What helped you figure out what to door what you truly wanted?

Please be kind. Im trying to be honest in a very confusing, painful moment.

Thank you.

I was instructed to prepare my body for 1 to 2 weeks because some of the medications needed to be inserted vaginally. After a week of preparation, I followed all the procedures.

A large clot came out, but I was told it was just a blood clot. Later, another clot came out along with a gray, jelly-like substance, but again, I was told it was normal. The day after the procedure, I was still bleeding heavily, but all my pregnancy symptoms (morning nausea, cravings, swollen breasts, and low energy) disappearedthough I still felt bloated.

Ive been bleeding for a week now, and clots are still coming out. I contacted the person I bought the MA from, and they told me I need to repeat the processwhich would mean paying a large amount of money that I cant afford.

Do you think my abortion was successful, or do I really need to do it again?

Just a bit of panic and anyone with any prior experience in this who can open up an ear and lend some guidance would be great cause there is quite a lot of panic and fear over here.

Just wanted to hear more about the process for MA as my Partner [27F] is currently 4 weeks along and have the ultrasound and follow up pre-booked for the end of the month. Both of us are freaking out as my partner REALLY wants MA over SA and is worried that it'll be too close to the deadline. Will she be prescribed the MS-2 at the follow up post ultrasound GP appointment? Or do we get a referral to a clinic? We are both very unsure about the process and it's causing a lot of stress as we are unsure we are taking steps fast enough.

Any info would be amazing

We went back the next day to the same doctor for a second scan and the same results occurred. This time she made sure to show us the blood movement view where blood flow turns blue or red and that there was no blood flow between in the tube/placenta or in the babys heart. Im no doctor so I have to assume she was looking in the right spots. It seemed legit so we scheduled the d and c because I think that method would have been easiest on me and we had a vacation coming up in the next few days that I didnt want this to happen during.

This sucks and Im grieving. And some of that involves watching similar stuff on TikTok because I guess it makes me feel not alone in this experience.

I was slowly coming to terms with the fact that this sucks and has happened to our family but now Im all in my head with the what ifs. What if that doctor was an idiot. What if my baby was alive still too? Did I kill my baby that I so terribly wanted!?

I fear talking to my husband about this because hes hurt too and I dont want to put these thoughts in his head too. I dont think thats fair of me if he doesnt have them already. But Im all in my head now feeling horrible and that maybe I should have waited.

I wouldve been 6w6d today. I took mifepristone on 4/12 @ 4pm, and took my first dose of misopristol orally (sucked on it for 30 minutes &amp; swallowed what was left) on 4/13 around 6pm. 
By 11pm, I had only soaked about one maxi pad (despite having very painful cramps), so my on-call doctor recommended that I take the second dose. I did, and woke up with about 1 maxi pad soaked and passed what seemed like the fetal sack. I didnt look too closely. 

Since then, Im barely bleeding - Ive passed 2 smallish blood clots, and have only soaked about half a maxi pad (Ive been changing them, but I am barely getting anything). Theres barely even blood in the toilet bowl when I pee. 

For reference, this is my second at-home abortion. My first time, I was 8 weeks at the time of abortion. I threw up the mifepristone. My doctor gave me the go-ahead to take the misopristol anyways. I only took one dose, and was in excruciating pain. I was soaking one maxi pad every hour or two for about 3 days, and I had way more blood clots than I am now. I bled for about 6 weeks after the abortion was complete. 

I was in so much more pain last time that I was unable to sleep, so I feel confused at how I was able to nap through this entire process. This time just seemed too easy? And now the blood seems to be tapering off&

Should I be concerned that this is an incomplete abortion? This time I was able to keep the mifepristone down - so maybe that helped. However I find it strange/alarming that I needed two doses, but wasnt as far along as last time. I feel like I should be bleeding a lot more than I am. Ive had some medium cramping since, with random strong cramps every couple of hours, but I wouldnt call this anything worse than a shitty period. 

I plan on calling my doctor tomorrow and expressing all of these concerns. Just trying to relax enough to sleep now. Will update after my phone call for anyone else going through something similar =¤","abortion",6,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jzl9c8/unsure_about_complete_abortion/"

9:00am - took 4 miso under the tongue. after 30 mins, swallow the remains.

Past few mins, been going to the toilet to release what i'm feeling on my stomach. Passed clots about 6-7x

12pm: took the second dose (2 miso). Still have cramps but manageable and still bleeding and passing clots. Also, i've been experiencing diarrhea since 1st dose

Past few hours, still bleeding and i changed my pads 3x and 1 diaper. 

3pm and 6pm: took the 3rd and 4th dose of miso, because i dont know if my MA is successful so i just took it. But at this time, i have a mild cramps, still have bleeding and diarrhea. 


APRIL 15: Day after the MA

Morning: Still bleeding like menstrual period and i felt different. So far, i haven't experienced the urge to vomit like before because my nausea is so bad in the morning and my breast is not that feeling heavy.

After the abortion I just feel more depressed is that normal to feel this way.  Idk if its because of the hormones that are still left from the abortion . 

I had also got a IUD so that could be the hormones for the IUD as well thats making me feel this way. 

plus I had bleed a lot and i think thats what might be causing me to feel low and weak.

My doctor said that before the procedure my iron was high so nothing I should worry about.

Now whilst i had free choice in this on whether to have the baby or not i was given all of the harsh realities and paths that not only me and my family would go down but my boyfriend and his family too. although i am young and the pregnancy was a complete accident a huge HUGE part of me wanted the baby but i couldnt bring myself to put everyone around me in any position of stress, mostly financial stress for both of mine and my boyfriends parents, and social stress for myself, my boyfriend, my sister, basically just everyone in mine and my boyfriends lives. people talk, people are quick to judge, and people are just mean. also i just felt horrible knowing i wouldnt be able to give the baby the life i dreamed of being able to give my future kids.   
  
so in the end i decided to have the abortion. and there hasnt been a day since where i havent cried. i miss my baby and i feel so guilty about it. i cry at the sight of a young child and i just feel so heavy hearted. i know it was the right decision for my future and for everyone around me but the guilt and grief is so overwhelming. i try to find closure knowing that the baby wouldnt have lived the life i dream of giving my children one day, because i wont have kids until i can do so, but it just isnt enough. im so sad just all the time and im dreading going back to school, especially knowing i cant even talk to anyone about it, but also its not like i have a lot of friends there either some girls are just really mean and some boys are too. Im just very fragile at the moment and im worried ill just randomly break down at school. im also worried about mine and my boyfriends relationship im trying really hard to stay as positive as i can be but he can see im not ok he can see a difference and yes he is there to support me but im afraid itll get too much and he will leave. 

i also feel quite empty now. like a piece of myself is missing and i can just feel myself slowly drift further and further away from my normal self. ive developed a bit of a fear of falling asleep because i know that im alone when im asleep and i wont sleep until my body genuinely just like passes out. i just feel really really lonely because in a way i wasnt for 4 months.

im so thankful and grateful to have such a good support system around me i was afraid my parents would kick me out and be angry but once they found out, at that point i was about three months along, they just held me and let me cry. my boyfriends parents have also been very supportive too.

but its like 2 weeks post abortion and theyve all forgotten about it. everyone seems fine, everyone stopped checking in on me, everyone moved on in 2 weeks. and i feel like a broken record stuck on a repeat of emotions.

im just really struggling right now and need some advice on ways to overcome this guilt and how to handle the grief and loneliness. please i understand i am young i do know i messed up bigtime falling pregnant. but i do well for myself in school and have big dreams. im really not looking for judgement i just want help. i am actively looking for a therapist its just are there things in the mean time that help or make it any easier or is it a thing i just have to deal with one step at a time?","abortion",2,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jz8elu/post_abortion_sadness/"

"216",216,"Did my MA work? Fewer clots than expected","2025-04-14",1744645828,"Did my MA work? Fewer clots than expected","TLDR: I (30f) only pushed out two substantial sized-clots within 5 hours of taking miso, and heavy bleeding subsided within 6 hours of taking miso. I was somewhere between 6-10 weeks (wide range, I know). My pregnancy symptoms are gone, but the relatively quick/easy process makes me question whether everything worked properly.

Longer version:

Overall I want to say that this was a largely positive experience, and this subreddit helped me SO much  from directing me to an online provider to providing advice for the process itself. I live in a state that requires an in-person clinic visit, an ultrasound, a waiting period, and then starting the MA in the clinic. The idea of doing all that in my condition (horrifically nauseous and tired all the time) and having to take off work multiple days for it was overwhelming. This subreddit helped me find a provider that mailed me mife + miso within a week of applying for it. Im fortunate that my partner and I could afford to pay full price ($150), but the provider has pay-what-you-can options, too.

I have ADHD which causes me to struggle with taking my birth control pills on time and keeping track of my cycle. Unfortunately, that all caught up to me, and on April 2, I took two pregnancy tests that came back positive. My partner and I thought I was probably only 5-6 weeks along, but since I didnt keep good track of my cycle, I couldnt be sure. I added four weeks just to be safe.

I got the pills delivered a week later, but I had to wait until the weekend so I didnt have to take work off. I was prepared for a whole weekend of intense pain and bleeding, but the experience was nowhere nearly as bad as I thought it would be.

Thursday -

3:00 PM: Took mife after work and went about my evening. A few hours later I definitely felt a hormonal difference because I wasnt sleepy anymore (I was sleeping like 12-14 hours a day for the two weeks prior) and got sort of grumpy.

Friday -

AM: I wasnt expecting any side effects from the mife, but unfortunately I did have pretty bad gas and some cramping throughout the day. I went home from work at 11 AM because of this.

4:45 PM: Put on overnight period underwear (like an adult diaper but fairly comfy; I decided to do this because I hate wearing pads); took 800 mg ibuprofen and Benadryl. I would alternate ibuprofen and acetaminophen every 4/5 hours throughout the night by setting alarms to remind me. I think this really saved me. My partner helped tremendously with this and also running around bringing me food, water, and Gatorade. d

5:45 PM: Took miso  I put four pills in my cheeks, waited 30 minutes, and then washed the remnants down with water.

6:15 PM: Almost immediately I started having moderate cramps, chills, and overall discomfort. Id say this was like a 7 out of 10 on the pain scale, similar to a bad period, but nothing too crazy. I went to the bathroom and there was light bleeding.

7:00 PM: Within an hour, my cramps were more mild, and I was able to enjoy watching Studio Ghibli movies with my partner and eat some ice cream.

9:00 PM: I went to the bathroom and pushed out a medium-large clot. It surprised me and I actually shrieked a little. It wasnt unpleasant, it just felt weird to push something that big (felt like a ping-pong ball) out of me. I was starting to get gas and was bleeding pretty heavily. I changed my period underwear. I could already feel a difference in my hormonal/mental state. I felt like the pregnancy brain fog was gone, and I didnt get nauseous thinking about food like I had been for the last couple of weeks.

9:45 PM: I took four more miso since I wasnt sure exactly how far along the embryo was. I had the exact same reaction as the first time: almost immediate moderate cramps, chills, and overall discomfort. My throat also hurt a bit and it almost felt like I had a light fever.

10:30 PM: Cramps turned more mild, I went to the bathroom and pushed out another medium-large size clot (this would be the last one; I only pushed out 2 total substantial clots). Still bleeding heavily so I changed my underwear again. Then I fell asleep.

Saturday 

12:00 AM: Woke up from bad stomach pain that turned out to be gas and diarrhea. I didnt have any more clots, which concerned me a bit. My bleeding was slowing down to a light period-like flow.

12:30-2:00 AM: Waking up a lot to go to the bathroom because of diarrhea. This was definitely a downside of taking the miso in the evening. I was having some severe gas pains, but my cramping was minimal. There wasnt very much blood anymore.


Following days:

Its been 3 days, and mentally I feel almost normal. The pregnancy brain fog, nausea, and fatigue from the last couple of weeks had really demoralized me, so Im extremely relieved thats gone. Im still having light cramps, gas, and light-medium bleeding with occasional small clots.

I think that the embryo may have been only 5-6 weeks along since the substantial clots I pushed out were so few. Does this seem plausible? I definitely feel much better, so that makes me hopeful that the MA worked.

Thank you to everyone in this subreddit for sharing resources and advice; it really helped me throughout the process. Honestly the only truly horrible thing I experienced was the pregnancy itself  Id never had a pregnancy before (at least not that I was aware of or that made it this far along), and I had no idea how god-awful it was going to be.

Hi everyone,

I (26F) recently found out Im pregnantalready 5 weeks and 2 days along when I took the test. I was terrified. Im the breadwinner of my family, currently supporting my brother through college, and neither my partner nor I are in a place to raise a child.

We reached out to both WoW and WHW. We decided to go with WHW because they were more responsive to emails. The consultation went smoothly and they said the pills would be shipped out within 12 days. Its been nearly two weeks now and Im currently 7 weeks and 1 day. Im planning to go through the MA as soon as the pills arrivebut theyre still not here.

According to ParcelsApp, the shipment completed the SIN-MNL leg on April 12, but theres been no update since. With Holy Week coming up, Im afraid things will be delayed even more. The waiting is driving me crazy. Im constantly anxious, I cant focus at work, and I find myself crying alone almost every day.

My partner doesnt know how badly Im struggling. Hes often out of town for work and even works weekends, so I feel like Im carrying this entirely by myself. I have past traumas, and this whole experience just feels like its reopening old wounds.

Lately, Ive been feeling so low. I keep thinking Im stupid, unworthythat I somehow deserve all the bad things that have happened to me. Im exhausted. I still pretend to be okay because Im tired of having to explain everything to everyone.

Even before this pregnancy, I used to tell myself that once my brother finishes college, maybe I could finally rest in peace. And that thought hurts, because deep down, I do want to enjoy life. I just dont know how anymore.

This will be my first and last MA. Im scared of the process, of the pain, of the blood loss (I have PCOS, too). But mostly I just feel lost, weak, and lonely. I could not tell anyone even my friends about this. I work from home so it gets more depressing whenever I'm alone.

If anyone has advice, reassurance, or just kind words& Id really appreciate it.

I need support. I feel overwhelmed and full of regret.

I took mifepristone 24 hours ago and I cant stop crying. Im still waiting to take the second pills and I just need support from anyone, because I cant tell anyone in my real life.

A part of me thought, maybe this is Gods plan  a second chance. I had a miscarriage last year around this same time, with the same man, whos my boyfriend and wouldve been the father again. Hes loving, supportive, and wants a baby just as much as I do. Losing the last pregnancy crushed us both, and I blamed myself because I was smoking and on heavy meds at the time. I felt like I didnt protect it. I hurt him.

Thats honestly why I didnt feel ready again this time  I felt like I might mess it up again. But everything looked okay. My hCG levels were doubling. It was healthy. I regretted it before I even took the pill. But I felt forced. Im stuck between my mom  who I take care of and who screams and manipulates me  and my boyfriend, who doesnt even know Im pregnant. I feel like I betrayed him.

He would be heartbroken if he knew, and that guilt is killing me. This baby is what we always wanted. I just panicked. I felt trapped. I waited a whole week before even taking the pills. I was also supposed to get a surgery Ive already paid a lot of money for. I cancelled everything last minute and now everything is up in the air.

I know I cant go back. I know I made the decision. But I honestly dont know why I did it. I feel like I got swept up in the pressure, in fear, and in everything being so loud around me. If I didnt hear my mother screaming, or my boyfriends voice in my head saying shes ruining your life, maybe I wouldve made a different choice. I feel alone.

I cant talk to my family. Theyd either shame me or use it against me. Thats why Im here. You guys behind the screen  strangers  probably care more than they would. And right now, I just need someone to say Im not evil. That Im not broken. That Im not alone. Because I feel like I am.

"233",233,"my experience with ma (positive!!) uk","2025-04-13",1744582281,"my experience with ma (positive!!) uk","hey, i just wanted to share my experience in case it brings even one person a bit of peace of mind.

long story short, i'm in my second year of uni and still have a long way to go before i'm in a place where i can provide for a child. after finding out i was pregnant at 5 weeks, i made the decision to have a medical abortion .

at first, i was absolutely terrified. i didnt think something like this could happen to me ive always been really careful. those three weeks between finding out and going through with it were some of the hardest emotionally . i kept reading through threads and terrifying myself, which honestly just made me feel worse. in hindsight, it felt like i was self-sabotaging by constantly consuming content that i *knew* would trigger me and make me doubt my choice.

so, my first piece of advice: please dont torture yourself by reading negative stories if theyre only making you more anxious. everyones experience is different, and feeding your fear in an already stressful situation does more harm than good. you know whats best for you  trust that. you have every right to make the decision that feels right for *you*.

now for the actual experience: i took the first pill (which stops the pregnancy hormones) 48 hours before taking the others. that pill was honestly the hardest part for me  it made me feel super nauseous, and i ended up throwing up a few times. but i just kept reminding myself that it would all be over soon.

when it came to the second part  the misoprostol pills  i was really scared. i knew pain was coming, so i prepared by taking codeine, ibuprofen, and paracetamol beforehand to stay ahead of it. i have a very low pain threshold, so i was *extra*anxious. thankfully, i have a very supportive partner who stayed with me the entire time (which i know not everyone has, and im really grateful for that).

once i inserted the pills, we just chilled and put on a movie. the cramps started off pretty mild for the first hour but got intense quickly. that two-hour window of pain was definitely the worst part, I was in agony for those 2 hours but it was only 2 hours. lying in a childs pose gave me some comfort, and i took another dose of codeine during that time. it felt like the pain would never end, but it passed just as quickly as it came.

honestly, once the worst of it was over, i felt such a huge sense of relief  almost like a high. the cramps after that just felt like a bad period, and mentally i felt much stronger knowing i was through the worst of it. i used about 4 pads over 5 hours and spent a good hour on the toilet just letting things pass. reminding myself it would all be over by the end of the day really helped.

the next day, i woke up feeling totally fine  just a bit lightheaded.

all in all, i just feel incredibly grateful to live in a place where i have access to this kind of healthcare and the right to make this decision for myself. the guilt in the beginning was overwhelming  i felt so awful and cruel  but deep down i knew i was making the right decision. i kept reminding myself how lucky i am to have a choice, and that helped me reframe everything in a more positive light.

I took 2 tablets orally and 2 vaginally of cytotec at the same time, 11 am, fasting for 12 hours. I started to feel a lot of pain in the first few hours, I had uncontrollable diarrhea, and a little blood came out. 

After 4 hours I started to feel an unbearable pain, really strong, I lay on the floor, lay down in the bathroom stall, even slept in the shower taking a shower because of so much pain. 

I woke up at 6pm, went to dinner, and I was no longer feeling any pain. At 8pm the pad got all dirty with blood, but for the next few days practically no blood came out.

Only on Wednesday, I took it on Saturday, more blood flow started to come out, I even thought that the procedure had gone wrong, as not much blood really came out, they told me that I should have taken 12 tablets and even that the gestational sac would not come out because it is 1 cm at this stage, but only blood.

But my experience is that the flow returned on Wednesday like a period and on Thursday after the bath the gestational sac came out of me, it was something kind of meaty, and it was even big, half the size of a little finger, just like the photos on the internet, after that the flow didn't stop.

I believe it worked!! But it is important to emphasize that it is a process that lasts for days. ","abortion",1,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jyijts/abortion_story_5_weeks/"

- At 4 i took the miso pills 

- at the three hour mark i started cramping mildly and bleeding. Around like 5 10 mins later i went to the bathroom and felt a clot fall out which was around approx 2 inches.
- my cramps were very mild , mild enough to not even need a painkiller and i wasnt bleeding very heavily. I went to the toilet again and this time another clot came out and still no heavy bleeding.

- i had my cramps become stronger and then go away on its own but still not very painful for me . I woke up a while ago and have still been bleeding but  the bleeding overall is not heavier than my normal period would be.

My question is whether or not i should take another set of miso? Or have i already passed it?

845 pm- took 800 mg ibuprophen and showered.

9:15 pm - inserted 4 miso vaginally.

9:45 pm- slight cramping

4/13-12:35 am- cramping still, no worse than a period. Got up to pee when i wiped a pill came out &amp; there was some pink. I panicked and reinserted the pill and could still feel a second inside.

4 am - woke up to pee. Felt gush, filled a pad a decent amount (about the heaviest day of my period) also had a clot the size of golf ball.
Continued to pee and fill the toilet with blood and  smaller clots.
Cramping was getting worse at this point but still manageable (5/10 pain) took another 800 mg and fell asleep.

7am-  woke up to another filled pad, this time i bleed through my underwear and pants. Didnt see a clot but when i wiped i saw glob off tissue about another size of golf ball.

11 am - now cramping and bleeding have subsided a lot. Still cramping/ stomach pain but now 2/10 pian. Bleeding wise has gone down to where i can wear a panty liner. When i wiped i still see tiny seed like clots.

One of my biggest pregnancy signs was rage and i was angry all the time before i even tested. I woke up feeling more at peace and happier. I still have breast tenderness.

i feel so alone. nobody understands how i feel. i don't know anyone else who has gone through this. i'm from montreal and struggling to find resources for help or support. i go to therapy but it doesn't help. i lost most of my friends this year and can't find it in me to talk to the few friends i have left, they wouldn't understand the depth of how bad it hurts and i don't want to confuse them or scare them. i don't really have family to rely on. all i really have to count on is my boyfriend but the relationship makes me feel uneasy and isolated and just confused.

I apologize in advance for my syntax or grammar, as Im still struggling putting my thoughts together, let alone writing them out. If this gets a little Virginia Woolf-y Im sorry, it might get really long. 


A little to know about me: Im 24 (25 soon), autistic, in college still, I live in a foreign country, and Ive been with my boyfriend(27) for 2 years now. 


A month ago I had a MA at 8 weeks, and it was traumatic to say the least. Worst pain Ive ever been in, which is saying something. Anyway. 
My whole life Ive always thought that if I found myself accidentally pregnant, that Id get an abortion with no second thought, no guilt, no regret, blah blah well, much to my chagrin, I was wrong. Though I think that, to be fair, had this been any other situation I would feel the same way, but unfortunately (fortunately) for me, I love my boyfriend more than anyone Ive ever dated. We plan to get married once Im out of school, and we talk about kids all the time already have names picked and everything. So when I found out I was pregnant, I was scared of course but I was also secretly very excited and happy. Its clearer looking back on it now (I think I couldnt even admit to myself back then that i was), but my bff was with me and she took a picture of my face when I read the test and theres real happiness in my eyes. My boyfriend was about on the same page as me, though much more frightened. Obviously, neither of us are in a position to have kids. Not financially, not physically (he lives with his mom, I have a studio), my family lives 7k miles away, he cant leave his country to go to mine, etc. Literally couldnt have picked a worse time for this to happen. Both of us grew up in harsh environments and Ill be damned if I let my child have to suffer through what either of us did. Logically, termination was the correct choice. I know that. 

But before I took the pill, I hesitated. I never hesitate on stuff. I *hesitated* and I cant stop thinking about it. A few weeks before I found out, I had this dream you know the kind that women get where youre pregnant and have the baby and wake up and you feel like something is missing ? That kind. And I had this beautiful baby girl, I could see her face so clearly, and when I woke up I felt like I shouldve had her with me. According to my calculations I shouldve gotten pregnant like the day before that dream,,, crazy. I know what its like to have something living and growing in me. I miss it. I feel empty without it. Will that pass ? I hope it does. Right now everything reminds me of it. I see babies on social media, people who arent in the best circumstances and theyre making it work just fine, and then I think « i couldve done that » and then Im hit with a terrible feeling of regret, and guilt, and self hatred. I dont know how to fucking handle this. I would be such a good mom. Everyone tells me I would be (I had a fantastic example), and I want to be one now. I was never sure before but now I am. And I almost had it& and then I gave it up. I never once considered the grief Id feel until I finally felt it. 
I mentioned Im autistic well its a bit of a problem since I really lack the emotional regulation skills to handle huge emotions like this on my own. Its only through films or music that relate to my situation that I can then safely work through them, and over the years Ive built up catalogues for everything I need. I know which media to seek for which emotions. Upsettingly though, this is a hyper specific problem which makes finding relatable media difficult. I havent been able to find solace in anything at all, except for one passage on some of the final pages of The Last Unicorn by Peter S. Beagle (my all time fav book) which says 

« I have been mortal, and some part of me is mortal yet. I am full of tears and hunger and the fear of death, although I cannot weep, and I want nothing, and I cannot die. I am not like the others now, for no unicorn was ever born who could regret, but I do. I regret. » 

Its the first time Ive ever interpreted the unicorn/human allegory like this, but its the closest Ive gotten. I feel so different around my friends now. I know Im fundamentally different from them in a way they cant understand, and in a way that I have never understood til now. I have all these feelings from the pregnancy, that I can remember but cant access. And the worst part of it all, is that I regret it. I want it back. 
Its fucked me up so bad I had to withdraw from uni for the rest of the semester. I cant stop crying over it. I feel like my life has been put on pause. And I cant even start to move on from it because im having some slight complications from the pill, which means more doctors visits. Idk what to do. I dont know how to recover. Im completely blind and no one in my life has ever had an abortion so theres no one around me who can relate or offer guidance. 

TLDR; my brain knows I made the « correct » choice but my heart and soul reject it. I cannot mediate the two, and the feelings in my heart are stronger than the logic in my head, and its draining me.

I need a little advice from the people here. My boyfriend &amp; I have been together about 2 months now. I recently discovered that he &amp; his previous partner had an abortion. There are several issues that have come from this. The first being his parents are EXTREMELY religious. He has never told anyone about this other than me, in fear of his family disowning him. He has so much pent up emotions, and no one to talk to them about other than me. While I want to be supportive (and I am) it would greatly benefit all parties if he would talk to a therapist- a professional who is unbiased. He is looking into therapy, which is a great step &amp; I am proud of him. The second issue is that its very overwhelming trying to help someone through this when theyve never really processed this himself. Since hes never brought it up to anyone besides me, the dust hasnt settled and its still all very real for him. 

Lastly, I need to fix myself so I can be there for him. Ive been in a situation similar to his, so it almost hits too close to home. In addition, I have this very irrational fear that if we do ever have children of our own one day, that Ill be nothing more than a replacement or itll just remind him of (what could have been). If anyone has been through something similar, please let me know how I can support him. As well as how I can get over my feelings in order to be there for him.

Weve all (5 siblings and 2 parents) had conversations over the years and although theyre pro choice, I think its more so pro choice for people outside the family. Theyve recently gotten to a new level in religion and are doing Bible studies and it just seems like the most terrible time for something like this to come in to the dynamic of our family. 

Ive had crying outbursts with my boyfriend and by myself and almost immediately gathered myself to act normal again. When Im alone its all I can think about. Anyone whos been through this, how long did it take for things to actually just go on and be normal? Is there anything I can do to bring it along faster?","abortion",3,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jg61pl/weird_how_life_just_goes_on_after_its_over/"
"313",313,"Hello, I apologize as this post may be a little all over the place. I had my abortion on March 4th, I was 10 weeks according to my last period, but I know my exact date of conception which was January 5th and my last period was the dec 24th. I dont know if this is allowed but I knew I was technically only 8 weeks along but considered 10. I got my pills from hey Jane and because I was 10 weeks I took two doses of miso after my first dose of mife (time accordingly of course). So now I am 2 weeks and 2 days out since my abortion and have been bleeding with lights clots since the heavy bleeding occurred after I initially took the pills. I took my last dose of mife around 7 pm went to bed at 9pm and woke up around 6 am and a clot the size of a golf ball came out. Since then I have had small clots and phases of light bleeding and period level bleeding. So on this Monday March 17th I think I ate something bad and got very sick that night diherrea and vomiting and since have been on and off nauses since then- Im hoping this was food poisoning and not a complication of the abortion ( for example today I felt nauseas and had diherrea and stomach cramps but didnt Wednesday) is this normal? I have also had on and off cramps that feel like period cramps since the actual abortion. I just want to make sure that my getting sick this week isnt a complication of the abortion. I can tell I still have some cramps that are from the abortion but also cramps from having to go to the bathroom. 

I am 27(f) and my boyfriend and I want kids just now wasnt the time for me. I dream of being a mom and its the one thing I have been so sure of since I was a little girl. I keep thinking over this after and think how maybe I couldve made it work although my boyfriend is finishing his final stages of his degree to get a position in his career. I however do work but am also finishing my degree and am not yet settled in my career and will not be for another year most likely. I wanted to have security financially and other factors such as a home that we own before I have children. It wasnt ideal to mining for me but now I keep thinking that maybe I couldve made it work and its hard I feel regret at times and then I feel secure in my decision at times. My boyfriend and I very much do want a family in the future. I tend to over think almost everything and after having this abortion i forgot to mention when I was 21 I had two abortions same boyfriend we were in college and not ready at all I was only 4 weeks for those two. Having three abortions is not something Im proud of. My fear is that something will happen like a complication and I wont ever be able to have kids, or that possibly I was infertile and that was my only chance. Its hard of not put these thoughts in my head. This experience because I am so scared has almost made me want to get pregnant again and I know that sounds crazy. I guess I am just I nervous that it possible wasnt successful, or that I wont get pregnant again or that something went wrong. I do have a follow up appointment with planned parent hood this Saturday. 
Sorry for this post being all over the place I havent told many people so its hard to feel assured right now.

He gave me the silent treatment for the rest of the day before saying how much I insulted him. I apologised and said it was the shock that made me immediately think of the future but they are real life issues that will effect me and the baby in the future. 

We had the most ridiculous fights all weekend. I have never fought like this in my life. (Pregnancy hormones)

So this might be a long post. 


Just a little background I was 9 weeks 6 Days when I took the Mife.

Feb 20 I found out I was pregnant with pt

3:16	Had diarrhea + bleeding + Clotting (was not able to see how big the clot is since there were also fecal matter)

5:00 am	Put 2 tabs miso under tongue

5:30 am	Swallow remains


I slept after 

6:30 am diarrhea with blood clot

7:30 am diarrhea with blood clot

7:45 ate breakfast . Finally no more dysgeusia. No more pregnancy symptoms aside from breast tenderness.


As of 11:46 pm
Still having cramps but tolerable
Still bleeding but not heavy
Still passing clots (small clots)


12 mn 
- guilt and sorrowness synced in to me. :(
Been crying
Feeling so much guilt


03/13 
Still having mild to moderate cramping
+ Bleeding and small blood clots coming out
 Still feeling so much guilt


03/15 
Continuous cramping and bleeding for the past days till now with minimal clots
- also experiencing severe cramps thats radiating to my perineum from my uterus especially in the afternoon.


03/16
At around 11:45 pm felt a tissue in my vagina while I was washing.
Messaged wow and they advised me to take 2 more miso.

I had no other concerning symptoms such as fever or the likes. 


03/17

10:00 pm took the Miso sublingually

10:30 pm swallowed with water

No cramps but still bleeding. No tissues that passed out yet. 


03/18
Messaged wow again for the update telling them that even after 24 hours after taking miso nothing happened..

03/19
No more severe cramping just mild ones. 

Felt the tissue hanging when i went to the toilet so I gently pulled it out but I think theres still something left inside.

There is still bleeding when I go to the toilet but its concerning me so much that my blood is already smelling like a rotten meat. I regulary change my pads. And do all hygienic things as to prevent any kind of infection. As of now I havent had any fever or any other concerning symptoms. Its just the smell that is bothering me.

Wow advised me to take 2 more Miso and take it every 3 hours, however, I told them I only have 2 with me now, so they advised me to take that last 2 miso and wait for 24 hours to pass.

03/20
10:00 am took the last 2 misoprostol I have. 

12:30 pm  And I have had no cramping yet. I just felt I was bleeding but like normallly and no clot/tissue had passed yet. But when I went to the toilet to pee. I was able to check down there just to see if there is still tissue thats coming out, but I just saw that, I think it was my cervix that I saw, it was already near my vaginal opening and when I opened it there are still tissues in there and i tried to bear down just for some tissues to come out and the tissue really smelled like a rotten meat. 

Did anyone also experience this? If so, what did you do?
I am from the ph and Wow also advised that if there has been no tissue that passed yet after 24 hours I need to go to the hospital already. But I am so hesitant as a lot of my relatives are healthcare workers and most of them are working in all the nearby hospitals around me. And I wouldnt want them finding out I got pregnant. 

But, if I ever really need to go to the hospital. Then I would really want to know if you guys have also went already because of something like this& and what did you tell the nurses and doctors that checked up on you?

Messaged wow again for the update telling them that even after 24 hours after taking miso nothing happened..

03/19
No more severe cramping just mild ones. 

Felt the tissue hanging when i went to the toilet so I gently pulled it out but I think theres still something left inside.

There is still bleeding when I go to the toilet but its concerning me so much that my blood is already smelling like a rotten meat. I regulary change my pads. And do all hygienic things as to prevent any kind of infection. As of now I havent had any fever or any other concerning symptoms. Its just the smell that is bothering me.

Wow advised me to take 2 more Miso and take it every 3 hours, however, I told them I only have 2 with me now, so they advised me to take that last 2 miso and wait for 24 hours to pass.

03/20
10:00 am took the last 2 misoprostol I have.

I took the abortion pill in October and bled for about 4-5 days and was fine after. 

Unfortunately, I got pregnant again in February and went through the abortion process again recently. I would have been about 5 weeks pregnant both times when I took the pills. 

I took the pills on March 6 and bled pretty heavily for the first week. I will add that my boyfriend and I did continue to have sex as early as March 9 and havent really stopped since. 

I thought I was done bleeding because there hadnt been any blood in my pad or when I wiped for a few days last week, but when we had sex there was blood when he took it out. 


I stopped clotting since last week and had the faintest amount, or no blood when I wiped or in my pad, but today after we had sex there was a fair amount of blood on him. I went to the bathroom not long after and I clotted about the size of a quarter. 

On Thursday Ill be 2 weeks post abortion pill and although I feel completely normal besides the bleeding, Im starting to worry that maybe something is wrong. I am already testing negative I just dont know what to do.

"334",334,"This experience is for those who are scared and needing another's experience and advice. I'll answer any questions if asked!

I turned 21 this spring. Found out I was pregnant about a week ago. And estimated the dates as I do not have health insurance and couldn't afford a doctors visit. 8-9 weeks. 

And let me tell you, this pregnancy was not going well. I was throwing up constantly and couldn't keep food down nor pain meds for about two and a half weeks. Which is why I took the test. 

Immediately turned to online sources as I live in a red state, Idaho, medical procedures were already out of the question. Which is where I found Abuzz. It took me 3 days to make my decision with a lot of online research and mental decisions.

So I bought an order.. 

I took the first pill with food I could handle. Which was just straight up buttered noodles. And waited roughly 24-30 hours after to take the misoprostol. Took the first 4 pills orally and threw up about an hour later. I knew it had absorbed partially, but I took a second dose without clarification. This time vaginally. The reason I did this rather than waiting 24 hours to take the next set of 4 pills... I couldn't miss work. 

So not even 3 hours later that's when the cramps hit. It was light at first then it all hit. I was basically tossing and turning, holding my stomach waiting for the pain to stop. And because I couldn't keep anything down, I would throw up every single pain pill I took in a matter of 10-30 minutes. But granted these weren't the worst cramps I've had. They felt like my usual when I didn't take any pain pills. Which I find hilarious, an independent abortion cramping wasn't as bad as my usual period cramps. 

Roughly 2 hours later, it was about 10pm I finally passed the fetus. And believe me I was shocked seeing that. But the amount of relief I felt. Not only from the pain but it was just an immediate feeling of something I can't explain. And believe me... it looked like a massacre had hit my toilet everytime I used it. I bled through so many pads, changing it every time I got up. And I could finally keep pain pills down. 

So, my prep I did. Towel on my bed. Towel on the bathroom floor. Washcloth. Lots of water, I had a gallon of water that I refilled once. A few snacks, which was mostly crackers. Heating pad. YouTube. And myself. 

No I didn't tell anyone about this. Not even my boyfriend as he is currently in his home town on the east coast, 12+ hours away for the month. My personal preference, I handle these situations better on my own. And if I needed anything, help was right across the street. My neighbor is extremely sweet and I told her what I was doing. She supported me, and would've gladly taken me to the hospital if need be without saying a word. 

I told my boyfriend the day after. He wasn't upset like I thought he would be. Instead, he supported my decision and was more worried about my well being than anything. But we both agreed next time to discuss it before I went ahead and handled it on my own. 

As of right now, I'm doing just fine! I finally ate and got to keep some solid food down. I'm feeling a lot better and still bleeding, not as heavily. And I did manage to go to work no issues! I had one pregnancy 2 years ago, and it was nothing like this. Lost that in a natural miscarriage at roughly 7 weeks. I am fully pro choice, but the way my body was reacting these last few weeks with this pregnancy, I couldn't handle it. 

I do feel a deep sense of loss and a bit of regret.. but at the same time, I am extremely grateful to have these things provided to me in this day and age. I do plan on being a mother one day, just not today.

"347",347,"Hello, I am from the Philippines. I had my MA exactly when I am 8 weeks and 3 days, last March 16. 

Here's what I experienced. March 15 at 5:00PM, I took the mife. 

The whole 24 hours I didn't feel anything except when I woke up in the morning on March 16; I experienced diarrhea when I woke up in the morning. 

March 16 at 5:00PM, I took the first dose of misoa total of four tablets. I followed the instructions to dissolve it under my tongue for 30 mins, and swallow the remaining pieces after 30 mins. After 1 and a half hours I started bleeding. I bled a lot of blood clotsbut they were small. I had heavy bleeding with many small blood clots, and extreme cramps. I also vomited after taking the electrolytes, and I think my vomiting was a blessing in disguise because while I was vomiting, blood clots came out of me. After vomiting and heavy bleeding with a lot of clots, I felt better. 

After 3 hours, 8PM on the same day, I took the second dose of miso... After taking it, I no longer felt cramps as much and my bleeding subsided. I still had some white tissue coming out together with a small blood clots. 

11 PM on the same day, I took the third dose but no more blood clots came out of me. It was just bleeding and no more blood clots, my cramping was not as bad either. 

I took all the pills I had, a total of 1 mife and 12 miso. I followed all the instructions. However, until now I only had bleeding and mild cramping. My sensitive/sore breasts are also gone.

But now, I am still anxious if: 

1. Is it normal that there are no large clots coming out? I read here that blood clots the size of lemons come out in them. 
2. Is it normal that after the 2nd dose of miso the bleeding and cramps subsided?
3. The white tissue, does that indicate a successful MA? 
4. Is it normal to not see any fetus yet? Because I did not see any fetus-like blood or what& >y

Please I need enlightenment from anyone here who has experienced the same thing as me.

Backround:Me and my girlfriend began to have unprotected sex for some time mostly because we thought we can manage it and since our relationship is close to 3 years there was a lot of trust and whatnot.

We had sex on my birthday and a little bit of the baby fluid kinda escaped my hand(i panicked for a second and tried to caught it in my foreskin xd) and we think it touched the outside of her vagina even though i don't really saw it happening. 

The flo app said she was off ovulation and that there are 7 days left until her period(even with slight inaccuracy of a couple of days i still don't think she could've gotten pregnant).

Anyway back to the subject.

I wanted to ask about the abortion pill,not because she is pregnant but we fear she might be even if it was late for 3 days.(we are about to leave for easter and i ve encountered many women that have a late period when they are leaving for a vacation and luck wasnt on their side and it came while they were on said vacation, and i tried to tell her that but didnt work well)

Even if she s pregnant she would be around 2 weeks max. Is there any bad side effects that are life changing or brutally painful? And how about recovery?How are your administering the pills etc

"363",363,"This is going to be a little long.  And I know Ive made bad choices. I feel extremely guilty and must face the consequences now. 

I have been with my boyfriend for 2 years.  He is 28 and I am 31.  Weve had a rocky relationship with fights and toxic nature, hes a narcissist and extremely selfish and mean when his mask comes off but when hes playing the part he can be nice and feed my delusions and I fall for it.  I struggle with extreme mental health disorders. I take antipsychotics and anxiety and blood pressure medication and can barely hold down jobs.  I met him at Amazon at one of my lowest points.  I tried to get away from him when he showed red flags.

Somehow we stayed together, I used to live with my gpa and it was an extremely toxic and emotionally and psychologically abusive environment so often Id escape to my boyfriends house even though it wasnt much better.  Let me add he lives with his mom and his older brother and step dad. 

My gpa ended up moving to a 55+ community and left me to fend for myself, hes the only family I really have. So Ive been at my boyfriends a lot.  Feel stuck.

Hes tried to have a baby for years with past girlfriends he told me and honestly we tried for a bit even though it was a bad idea but ya know rose colored glasses.  Anyways 2 years later he knocked me up.  I was kind of surprised because I didnt think he could and I freaked out when I found out I was pregnant. 

He hasnt worked in months and uses me as an excuse since I have problems to enable his lazy behavior. Weve known I was pregnant for 3 weeks now and hes shown no urgency to get a job or change anything.  We DoorDash for money and he still decided to miss his bills last month.  He is honestly scaring the hell out of me. I am panicking. I dont feel I can trust him or rely on him. 

I tried to bring it up a couple times and each time he gets defensive and angry, he doesnt reassure me or tell me not to worry he just feels his poor ego attacked.  I have two other daughters. One lives with her dad and one I have every 2 weeks for 4 days. 

We cant live at his moms because I cant bring my other daughter over there isnt enough room.  And Im worried hes just going to be so lazy and do the bare minimum.  Even if he does get a job I dont think hed be able to handle it.  Hes never lived on his own so he doesnt really get how hard it is.  He is a little delusional with that stuff.  And I fear this whole pregnancy is just a scary delusion where he doesnt understand reality. 

I dont feel confident in him. And its extremely upsetting and confusing because I love him and were so close but hes a terrible provider and I dont know what to do. He just talks shit to me when I tell him my worries because I told him I had an abortion once before and I asked him not to throw it in my face but yet he does. I knew I shouldnt have trusted him with that. Its just not would have came out in the appointment. I dont want to sign myself up for this as much as I love him. 

And if I leave him and abort it also comes with prices.  Ill be living in my car homeless. So sometimes I wonder if I should just settle.  But I already have resentment and so much anxiety.  Im running out of time to make a choice.

Ill have to go with SA abortion now. And Ill need to do it within a month. I dont know if I can afford it. I saw a post about abortion findings and Im going to try that I think.  Do I just call? 

Also Im not ready to leave him emotionally.  I feel so torn. And I feel guilty taking this away from him but part of me feels he doesnt deserve this and isnt responsible but who am I to say that.  And I should have known better.  Like I said I struggle with mental health and I think my brain just got carried away and now Im in a really bad spot. 

He gets me teas and rubs my back but thats not good enough. I need advice. I need help. I have no family or guidance. Im terrified. What did I let happen :( I should know better Im 31. 

Should I give him a chance to step up? 

My last abortion I was so depressed for many months and it was very difficult for me, I grew up very religiously and was told Id go to hell for this stuff so it just eats me up and its a really hard choice.  But this seems like a bad choice too. Idk.  I go back and forth in my head but last night I got really upset. 

EDIT:  I want to add that he has been patient with my mental health although he does trigger a lot or used to. Weve grown and have come a long way but sometimes when we argue that stuff comes back out. Hes emotionally the nicest person Ive been with but I think its still minimal and Ive just been with a lot of jerks.  Sometimes I feel like with my mental health I wont attract a decent guy I need so this is what I deserve.  But this route doesnt seem good either.

"386",386,"I have had a previous MA at 9 weeks and its was quite painful and the bleeding was insane. I was really scared going into this further along this time but honestly this was physically less painful than the first time.

I was 11 weeks and 4 days.

4/11 at 5PM I took the mifepristone pill

4/13 at 9:45AM I took 4 miso pills inside my cheek while I took a shower. I was so nauseous so I just held my spit in my mouth, I couldnt swallow the saliva. After 3 minutes I swished my mouth with juice and swallowed the pill remnants.

4/13 by 10:30AM I was experiencing some intense but manageable cramping. Last time I took miso at 9 weeks it made me so sick. I was shivering with horrible chills but did not have that side effect this time.

4/13 at noon I was still crawling but manageable still. I laid down, then ate lunch. I was till able to function through the cramping. I did use the restroom and had veryyy minor spotting. At this point I didnt wanna sit I just wanted to stand or lay down. So I was leaning over the counter and felt a little small gush. I thought I was bleeding but went to the bathroom and it was just clear fluid (I assumed my water was leaking or broke). Still manageable but uncomfortable.

4/13 at 1:15PM I took my second dose of 4 miso. This time I immediately threw up after swallowing the remnants. But almost immediately around 1:30 or so the cramps got way more intense. It was honestly pretty painful but I was able to just lay down. I did take Ibuprofen before the first dose. Still only minor spotting

4:13 at 2PM I was in quite a bit of pain. I remember texting my partner at 1:53 saying this is excruciating. At exactly 1:54 I felt a pop and a huge gush and the pain immediately stopped. I thought the bleeding had started but went to the bathroom and my water had fully broken. I beared down slightly to bleed and a small amount of blood and the fetus fell out of me. I couldnt bear to flush it so I scooped it out and sobbed. Up until this point, my main concern was the pain. I wasnt thinking of the emotional toll but as soon as I saw the fetus I broke down. I did feel a lot of guilt in that moment. But after calming down I cleaned myself up and laid down. I did bleed pretty heavily with some cramping and clots. Im assuming I passed the placenta based off the number and sizes of clots I passed.

Today is 4/15, yesterday the bleeding was very minimal but today it is like a heavy period. I definitely feel similar to how I did postpartum after my children. Yesterday I went grocery shopping and walked around and I think I needed more rest. My blood and pain picked up last night and I need to let my body rest.

Im traveling out of state for this to happen. I wanted to believe so badly I could handle having two kids but I have come to the conclusion that it is just not my time. I felt like I was faking it honestly. I was trying to make it work. I wish I wouldve decided sooner to have an abortion but its okay because I still have time and I have finally decided to do whats best for me. Im so scared but everything feels different about this pregnancy. I feel like my body is rejecting it.. although the first time I was pregnant wasnt fun, it was a lot more enjoyable and less exhausting than this time around. This time I feel scared and Im also scared because I remember what its like to be in the labor and delivery room. I feel like that was the most aware Ive ever been in my entire life. My experience wasnt traumatizing, but its definitely unforgettable. I remember every moment that led me to birthing my child and honestly, Im scared to do it again. Sometimes my stomach churns because of my vivid memory of delivering my baby and how honestly it still feels like it was yesterday. (I know a lot of people say that you forget so you have another one but I havent forgotten a moment). I do know I dont want to put my body through that again so quickly& my son is only one and I feel like I owe him more time to dedicate being a mother to just him and making sure that he has everything he needs to be successful in life. 

Sorry, I just needed to ramble a bit and get this all off my chest but I will update after my appointment.","abortion",3,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jpevdk/thoughts_before_my_sa/"
"420",420,"Feeling guilty","2025-04-02",1743561879,"Feeling guilty","I had a MA in 2023. I dont regret it because I in no way can afford a child or even take care of a child because of my current circumstances and I still dont know if I even want child. I had a fling, was dumb and didnt use protection, the guy was very supportive which made the decision so much easier and Ive kept it a secret to all but a few people in my life. I, like so many others, grew up in a family that looked down on people who had children before marriage and although I dont care when you have children I felt ashamed that I was in the situation I found myself. 

Heres where the guilt plays in and the questioning of why. So many people in my life (my brother and SIL included) have had such a hard time getting pregnant and having a viable pregnancy. I know so many women going through fertility treatments that are in loving, supportive, life long relationships and want so desperately to have a child but have had such a difficult time. I feel bad that I got pregnant easily (I was only 5-6 weeks so who knows how the rest of the pregnancy would have gone) and so many others want nothing more to get pregnant and start a family and I had an abortion. Is this common? Like I dont really want kids right now and I know how fortunate I was to get pregnant but I cant help but shake this guilt that it was easy for me to get pregnant and I decided to terminate it. 

I know its not my fault in any way that the people I love are having such a difficult time conceiving but I cant help but feel bad for terminating something that they want so badly. ","abortion",2,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jpedm1/feeling_guilty/"

They really helped me and I know it can be a scary thing, especially reading so many horror stories. So Im gonna try my best to give you live updates and hope for a positive experience! I deal with horrible health anxiety so I myself am terrified but keen to get it over with.

For reference: Im 6 weeks pregnant and just not ready at all. 

I have stocked up on meds, tasty treats and always maximum protection adult nappies incase I fall asleep from all the meds or bleed into the bed or anything, just being extra cautious and comfortable.

5:15pm yesterday: took the first tablet (Mifepristone).

5:00pm today: people have said taking painkillers before helps so I took 800mg Ibuprofen (therapeutic dose recommended through BPAS) and 1000mg of paracetamol (normal recommended amount for adults). I also have 30mg of codeine but Im gonna wait and see if I need it if the cramping gets severe. My anxiety is crazy right now but hoping for the best.

5:30pm: inserting misoprostol vaginally and waiting for the effects to kick in!

6pm: cramping has started, feels like mild period pain right now 

6:30pm: cramping has intensified a bit, still just feels like a period but Ive taken a 30mg codeine ahead of the more intense cramping that happens around the 2 hour mark apparently 

7pm: cramping has intensified slightly just feels like a heavy period pain, gonna stand up and go to the toilet and see how I feel moving about 

7:11pm: went for a wee and bleeding started while I was walking back to my bedroom, cramping has intensified so I guess my body is getting rid of it now, or starting too. Ive taken another codeine cos its painful but not unbearable, when I feel bleeding get heavy Ill sit on the loo

7:21pm: cramps are pretty bad right now might go back to the loo I think my body is trying to pass it I hope they dont get worse than this 

8pm: cramps are pretty horrific now Im rocking back and forth and getting chills up my spine which is normal apparently.. Im doing low steady hums because its supposed to signal safety to your brain and relax your body, its definitely helping 

9:15pm: between 8 and 9 was the hardest part, I had to get my sister to rub my back and cover me in blankets and then help me down to the loo because I felt the urge to poo, but when I pushed a massive clot came out and I think that was the pregnancy. Im now laying in bed with a temperature as if Ive got the flu but the cramps have definitely died down. Ive just taken the last two miso pills orally.

10:36pm: still going, pains calmed down for a bit but I just started contracting again and a big lump came out again 

11.28pm: honestly having a really rough time, had a second wave of contractions and threw up. But I dont want to make this post a negative one so believe me if I can do this, anyone can d

I think it might be passed now but Ill let you know. My biggest advice would be deep breaths and do whatever your body tells you to do intuitively - I only went to the toilet because I thought I was going to poo myself but I just wanted to be in bed and blankets the whole time releasing it all into the nappy pad. You should definitely get hold of some of these as they give you freedom to be wherever you feel safe and comfortable, you have to work with your body or stress will slow you down.

With my first, I dont recall my period taking a while to come back to normal. 

Im on week 6 and STILL no period. 9 I got a little bit of spotting today, BUT, I also used the tiaconzole stuff ( for yeast infections, Im on a college team and we sweat reallyyyy bad so its common for us) ANYWAYS, so I cant tell if Im bleeding a little from that, or if this is my actual period, or if Im just spotting. 

I also feel like I should mention Im embarressed to say but rather than waiting the 2 weeks, we only waited 1 week to resume sexual activity. 

After about 5 days my bleeding was easing up, however, it was like everytime we did it I would start bleeding all over again. And the blood smelled HORRIBLE. So I feel like that messed up my cycle too 

ANYWAYS, getting to the point, I made an appointment for the depo birth control shot and the first appointment before getting it will be tomorrow. I am not from this state, I only go to college here. But abortion is illegal in both states, so my question is 

Should I wait until I bleed more before going? So that I know its my period? 

Or should I just go and lie about my last period?

What if they find something in my urine that suggests I couldve been pregnant? (Wild but Im so anxious) 

I just dont want to go and them find something out and then catch me in a lie and get sketched out, but I also dont want to proudly announce to her that I just got an abortion. 

Idek who the woman is. I just reached out to the closest birth control provider. 

My bf is mad bc Im not getting it over with, but I feel like Im not ready to go in there and act like everythings cool. Especially when the whole point of the first visit is to talk about my sexual history. I feel like Ill be weird and awkward. Im a very outgoing and bubbly person and I say what comes to mind, but anytime I have a secret or Im lying, I get so quiet. 

it isnt the doctors business to know if Ive had an abortion however I. CAN. NOT. LIE. Im so obvious. Im worried about lying about my last period. And Im worried about lying about my SEXUAL partners. Because there have been a few. Im worried about lying about no history of pregnancies. 

What if I tell them I just had my period and yet the test shows positive ??? (It should def be negative I am not pregnant but idk how high tech their tests are) do I act shocked like  yay! And never go back? What if they try to set me up an appointment for like an ultra sound and treat me like a pregnancy patient ?!? 

Again my pregnancy tests are saying negative so I feel like Im good but I just feel like it cant be completely brushed under the rug until I get my period so Id rather go when I had a clear conscience. 

SOMEONE I BEG YOU PLEASE TELL ME WHAT TO DO!!! Google is no help!!!! Im nervous about asking my parents because they were dissapointed that I used that last abortion as birth control so I dont want them asking if Im having sex again.

**Height: 5'5**

**Weight: 115 LB** 

\*\*I have a couple of tattoos and I think that is important to note when it comes to describing the level of pain I experienced\*\*

I wanted to write a thorough post for any folks who are scared shitless like I was. I scanned this subreddit looking for personal experiences and found a lot of the posts lacking important information like how far along they were in their pregnancy, whether it was a surgical or medical abortion, a timeline of events, etc. 

I have to take a pregnancy test every month before I can be prescribed psychiatric medication. It's mandatory I am on birth control if I take this medication. I was on progestin-only pills. I took the pills daily, never missing a day, however I was sometimes off \~3 hours. With progestin-only pills, you typically don't get a period so I had no idea I was pregnant. During my routine monthly visit to obtain my medication at my psych's office, I learned I was pregnant. I didn't feel any pregnancy symptoms, just that my breasts were a bit sore. They tested my urine 3 times. I was shocked. I live in a state where abortion is banned after 6 weeks or if a heartbeat is detected. My psych offered me resources and explained to me the law and my options. 

First, I had to get an ultrasound to determine how far along I was. I don't have have health insurance and was able to find a clinic that would perform the ultrasound free of cost. I was fortunate enough to get an appointment 2 days after learning I was pregnant. Ultrasound determined I was 6 weeks, 1 day pregnant. An abortion in my state was not an option anymore. After leaving my appointment, I sat in my car and ordered Plan C pills from https://aidaccess.org/en/. They arrived within 4 business days. I received one dose of misoprostol and 12 doses of mifepristone. Most women will take 4-6 pills of mifepristone. The extra was just in case. 

I did extensive research, messaged [aidaccess.org](http://aidaccess.org) with all my questions, concerns, and anxieties while waiting for the pills to arrive. My partner and I took off 2 days dedicated for the medical abortion. We decided I would take the mifepristone pills on 3/5/2025 at 8:30 AM EST. Aid Access sent an informative email on what to expect, noting that the pain will vary person to person. They told me a combination of Ibuprofen and Acetaminophen was recommended. 

Now for the timeline of events: 

**Preparation:** 

* Advil
* Tylenol Extra Strength 
* Heating pad 
* Liquid IV 
* My favorite snacks 
* Puke bucket 
* Overnight pads
* Baby wipes 
* Comfy change of clothes handy 
* Towels 
* 0.5 mg klonopin (which I am prescribed)

**3/4/2025 9 PM** I take the single misoprostol after a light dinner. Felt no symptoms at all. 

**3/5/2025:** 

**8:15 AM** Took 800 mg of Advil and 500 Tylenol Extra Strength. Placed the heating pad on my belly and waited. 

**8:50 AM** My partner helped me insert 4 pills of mifepristone vaginally, as far as he could push them up.  I was advised taking it vaginally is ok if you're prone to nausea. 

**9:21 AM** Feeling light cramping/contractions. I get INCREDIBLE sleepy, so I fall asleep while my partner is in bed next to me. 

**11:32 AM** I start waking up and go to the restroom to see if there is any bleeding. The cramping was still pretty light (4 out of 10 pain), nothing different than my normal periods. I pass a small clot the size of a quarter. 

**11:40 AM** I take 2 more mifepristone, except this time I held the pills under my tongue for 20 minutes then swallowed what remained with water. I was worried that the contractions weren't coming quick enough. At this point, I just get sleepier and sleepier and pass out. My body is not in pain but I feel so exhausted that I can't keep my eyes open. I fall asleep. 

**12:15 PM** I jolt awake and feel stronger cramping. The pain is about 6/10 for me. I can tell ""it's coming."" I rush to the toilet and wait for a bit. I'm passing small clots and more bright red blood. I'm communicating with my partner via text to let him know what's going on. 

**12:38 PM** I feel a large jelly-like clot come out. I stood up and took a look and I believe it was the pregnancy. It was about the size of a deflated lemon. I could make out white fluid in the center of the sac that may have been the embryo. Worst part is over. 

I sleep for 6 hours after this. My energy levels felt normal by the next day. 

It's currently 4/1/2025 and I'm still bleeding a bit. Some days, it's light spotting but other days it's like a heavy period. The bleeding is inconvenient. I'm now on a combination birth control (Sprintec) that I started on 3/9/2025.

I hope this experience makes it less terrifying for anyone in this situation. Please feel free to ask questions.

First things first, I have seen in a couple of other states that deep sedation is no longer a thing at Planned Parenthood and i wanted to confirm that the sedation was not an option that was provided. I had moderate sedation and anti-anxiety medicine, which helped me tremendously along the way. Though I got moderate sedation I actually fell asleep through the whole procedure, and it only took about five minutes. I think a part of the reason why I fell asleep is because I didnt eat/drink anything for about 6 hours before just in case I couldve got the deep sedation, but the nurses recommended that I shouldve ate a light meal. 

Because my pregnancy was so early, the clinic actually wanted me to wait about two weeks so that they could visually confirm that the pregnancy was terminated, but I was very eager to get the process done and over with and opted to come in the next day and do bloodwork, in order to confirm that I was no longer pregnant. 

Also, in california, there are low to no cost programs if you dont have any health insurance, or if you are unable to pay, please tell your receptionist your situation and try to apply for it. This helped me tremendously and I just wanted to educate other people on the fact that there are programs available. The same programs paid for me be sent home with birth control same day.

Me and partner decided before we even were officially together that babies were a no go, so that wasn't a problem for either of us, and with my family history, there's no way in heck I'm bringing another life into this world, especially at age 19. (My mother conceived me at 17 and had me at 18, and me and my brother's lives have been nothing but hell and theirs continue to be.)

Anywho frustration out of the way, this is first pregnancy and as such, first abortion. I'm scheduled with Planned Parenthood for Wednesday morning for a surgical procedure, and I have 2 major questions:

For those with already irregular periods, will the abortion and hormones that continue afterwards screw it up even farther? In the past few months alone I've jumped around from it being the end of the month, to getting 2 in a month, to it being the beginning, and we're at midway through the month technically right now if it had come after last month's. Currently sitting at 9 days OR 5 days late-ish depending on whether it would have come midway or at the end of the month. 

Does anyone have an experience with getting a birth control implant right after? Internet said it's the best time to do it honestly but I've had a bad experience with it before but it's the best for my memory since I tend to forget things very easily, like medication and appointments. 

I've tried pills, the implant, and the 3 year shot so far, and all have just caused 24/7 bleeding and dizziness, which we chalked up to the iron deficiency and hormone imbalances as well, but I'm thinking (idk for sure since I'm not a doctor and need to get a new primary care apparently) my iron levels might have evened out some for this to have even happened, so maybe it wouldn't be as bad if I tried again? And if not I can always get it removed again, which fixed all the problems only days after last time

I'm so sorry if most of this is rambling, I'm really only going off of what I know about my own body and various ""research"" (rabbit hole internet searches) I've done over the years cause my family history is a mystery to me and my mother is nooot the person to talk to about this unfortunately.

I found that it was really mixed in how much pain and side effects people experienced so I really prepared myself for the worst and Im glad I did.

I took step 1 on Friday afternoon. Felt mild cramps and started bleeding like a period about 25 hrs in. Took step 2 Friday morning at about 10:30. I took and anti-nausea tablet 30 mins before. My doctor told me to take paracetamol, ibuprofen and endone all together on the first sign of pain, so after 30 minutes of step 2 being in my mouth and swallowing, I started smoking a joint. My cramps started hitting about 5 mins in which were moderate, so took the combination of pain killers. About half way through my joint they ranked up so with my hot water bottle I ran to the toilet. I wasnt bleeding much but was definitely feeling the contractions which would ebb and flow. They would progressively get so intense and only have maybe 15 second gaps in between. I think when youre going through so much pain, your body doesnt know how to process it, so I started breaking out in sweats, feeling so hot, and needing to vomit. I texted my boyfriend who brought me up a bucket and fan, while I laid butt naked on the bathroom floor to cool down. I didnt vomit, as I did not want the pain medication to not work. Everytime Id sit back up on the toilet the floor was wet from my sweat. After an hr (not sure whether it was due to the medication working or my body wasnt contracting) I felt better and crawled into bed. I slept until about 2 (I think) in the same pain so took another endone and ran back to the bathroom and went through it again, except this time I was bleeding reasonably sized clots. I was sweating and going in between laying on the bathroom floor and the toilet, feeling like I needed to poop. About an hr in I did, and felt a lot better. Came back to bed and slept until about 7pm and woke up feeling weak. I had cramps until 2am but they were just mild, didnt need to take any medication just rode it out with my hot water bottle. I woke up this morning feeling really fatigued and like yesterday was a fever dream. Its crazy how your mind dissociates when youre in pain. yesterday just doesnt even feel real. 

The pain was about an 8/10 at its peak. I dont want to scare anyone reading this but you really can handle it. Our bodies are made to do this and you will get through it! ","abortion",2,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jnv1kj/my_56_week_ma_experience/"

thursday @ 6:02 p.m. i took the first 4 misoprostol. they had completely dissolved within 10 minutes, so i swallowed. hopefully they will still work

also the cramping comes and goes 
@9:03 p.m. i took the 2nd two misoprostol and actually let them dissolve this time. the cramps are pretty much subsided for now, im still bleeding but not crazy, and i was able to eat a regular meal
@11:50 p.m. i am very anxious that this will not be successful. i threw up the misoprostol after 12 minutes when i took the first four and i didnt think to take another dose. i am praying and begging god right now. 
@12:03 a.m. 2 more misoprostol, let dissolve fully this time too

Hi everyone, I recently had a failed MA bought by a local seller. Im exactly around 7 weeks and 5 days to 8 weeks as of now as estimated by pregnancy calculators. 

Im bleeding heavily and Im passing big clots but nothing that would resemble a fetus. I donated to WoW this morning and just waiting for their confirmation (update: they have confirmed it), every passing moment is scaring me. 

I plan on getting a tvs scan too to know whats up with my bleeding, but Im scared of what might happen during the procedure as Im keeping this a secret from everyone but my boyfriend. Also so that I can get pills from FPOP incase WoW pills arrive too late.

I just feel so alone and miserable right now. No one knows about my situation and even if I have my options laid infront of me Im so scared that it wont work just like my previous MA attempt. 

My boyfriend has been really good with reassuring me and him being calm in this situation and telling me we already ordered the pills and will get a tvs scan is helpful, but I still find myself feeling so anxious and its been eating me up. I just want all of this to be over. =

"463",463,"8 week MA","2025-03-27",1743093190,"8 week MA","I'm writing this as I know how much reading others posts helped me, and how some terrified me! 

I used a private provider as the NHS wanted me to wait over a week for my telephone appt and it was messing with my head. 

Emotionally I was ok with my decision and revisited it several times before I started the process to make sure I wasn't going to have any irreversible regrets. 

I took my 1st tablet of mife on Tuesday night. I made sure I ate with it as I had read that it can make you nauseous and I wanted to ensure I could eat as much as I could while I could so I had energy for the 2nd stage. By Wednesday I was honestly floored with nausea - I am one of those people who will get nausea and throw up very easily though so. I was sick a couple times weds and just stayed in bed trying to reserve energy for taking the Miso. 

Thursday morning I took some cyclizine for nausea, my pregabalin (prescribed for panic attacks), and an iron supplement at 7am. I did puke by about 8am but at least some of this got into my system. 

At 9.30am after eating breakfast I took 800mg ibuprofen and 30mg x 2 of cocodamol. At 10am I inserted 4 miso pills vaginally and I fell asleep until 12pm. (I'm also one of those people who gets drowsy from just paracetamol so I was knocked out). 

By about 12.30 I had some mild dull aches around my womb but nothing worse than vague period pains. By 1pm these had elevated but only like a normal period. I had not started bleeding by this point so I inserted the other 2 miso tablets vaginally. 

I had quite a lot of vaginally pressure and abdominal cramps by this point but had to wait until 1.30 to take more pain killers which i did. Another 400mg ibuprofen and 2 x cocodamol. From here the cramps built to a severe period cramp, really uncomfortable but not crippling excruciating pain. By around 2.15 I was struggling to get comfortable in any position and all I could do was sit on the toilet. Again not excruciating just very uncomfortable. 

I had been using heat pads but the ones I got were honestly shit, so I decided to get in the shower and hold the hot water on my abdomen. I stayed on all 4s in the shower for around 45 mins. By this point the cramps were pretty intense and making me moan out loud, it was really uncomfortable but the hot water helped and it wasn't unmanageable. Would I want to do it again? No.. but it wasn't traumatising pain. 

I was getting the urge to push down so I kept doing that with each cramp. I still wasn't bleeding much but eventually I passed the pregnancy. It popped out of me entire and the literal second it was out all the pain stopped and the nausea etc went away. 

All in all the actual painful bit was less than 2 hours, it didn't make me cry or scream, and I think the shower was a life saver.

I am 1 week post MA. me and my boyfriend are young  both college students I have my own place and my boyfriend lives with his mom (its a very toxic environment hence why  he has been at my place for 5 months straight so i guess you could say we technically live together) so he is a father of a 2 year old that ive been around since she was 1. hes an active father but financially absent since losing his job 9 months ago and is struggling to find work due to CH& although this was a wanted pregnancy especially him, he wanted me to keep the baby i ultimately decided that it would not be the best decision given both of our current life situations his more than mines and it would ultimately be selfish (my mother would tell me the reason why she had kids later than her peers was because she wanted to make sure her kids got more than the bare minimum). So the day ive been dreading has finally arrived we got into an argument because i told him i was not mentally ready to be around any baby especially his child given what i just went through  and i dont know when ill be ready (he tried to make me give me a time frame) he called me selfish and told me to so i cant spend time with my child until you get over yourself because of a stupid decision you made (he was very caring during and supportive the MA process but this statement hit hard)& i know he doesnt want to go back to his moms place even if its for a 5 days because thats how long he gets her every 2 weeks but i also dont want to speed my healing process or even fake like im healed to please him and end up resenting him

I found out late that Im pregnant like 2 weeks ago literally thought it was a stomach bug.

Im considering not keeping my baby because this was unplanned and I dont know I dont feel ready to be a mother. Because of the fact that I have my doubts,  such as Im unemployed right now, feel I need to finish school first like figure Im out what career path to go in life I feel unstable (I only have my bachelors considering going back for masters), plus ideal with anxiety/depression sometimes in life (dont feel best to bring a child into that, or feel thats fair for the baby).

Also I feel my life is over kind of as my life is not just focused on me but to just be a mom . As I have another life to take care of. Of course if I keep the baby I do have family support such as my mom and boyfriend. But idk Im scared that I might lose myself as Ill be a mother now .

But idk not everyone has everything figured out when a baby comes &.I guess Im just scared of this possible new chapter in life and most importantly being someone MOTHER like thats some extreme stuff.

Dont get me wrong I always wanted to be a mother in life and still do. But idk I dont feel happy about it or looking forward to it &idk if its the hormones or what, I feel depressed.

Some people in my life know Im pregnant already such as of course my mom and boyfriend (father of the child).

My mom is angry if the fact that I told her might not keep the baby and we had arguments about it. She think I reconsidered and now think Im keeping the child. 

My boyfriend said its up to me if I want to keep it. He started to get frustrated with me because I keep changing my mind if I want to keep it or not. So I stopped talking to him about it for 2-3 days now. And I guess he assumes Im gonna keep the baby now. 

So basically no one knows I might get the abortion on Thursday.

I guess Im scared about the SA because I scared on how Ill feel after the procedure I feel I might feel guilty or like a terrible person like I murdered my own baby. Also that I had Betrayed god and my ancestors and all that&I know extreme 

Plus Im scared of the SA procedure it self like is it potentially dangerous or risky .

Ive did my MA yesterday March 25, but im concern whether it was a successful one or not. I frequently give an email update to WoW each time i take another dose of miso. I took a total of 5 dose and im waiting for a reply from WoW (they replied at 10 am as i was writing this, originally i took 4 dose with two remaining pills left yesterday. they told me to take the last two.) im hoping someone might assist me on my concerns.

Heres a the timeline:

Pre-MA



March 12 package has been sent.

March 21 Ive received my package door to door. There was a 116php fee. (it took about 8 days. I live in Manila so its faster)



MA



March 24 

11:17 am took the mife. Felt the same.

  


March 25 

9:30 am 

i had lugaw because i have a feeling i might throw up



10:00 am 

took ibuprofen and and meclizine (Bonamine)



11:17 am 

i put 4 miso under my tongue as instructed. It tastes chalky. 

After 30 mins i swallowed the remaining pills.



11:51 am 

the cramping gradually started getting worse. Then as expected, i vomit a few minutes after. 



1:09 pm

the pain was so bad im not use to pain, although its the same as all my regular period cramps but i still dont like the feeling. I was having chills, and my temperature rose. I tired sleeping it was so hot and cold at the same time. 

i started bleeding (i started bleeding after an hour or so when i took the pill. im just using the time stamps from the chats i sent to my partner so around this part its not as time accurate, sorry) and i felt a sense of relief and ease. I was still cramping but not as bad as earlier. I finally was able to sleep. 

The last 7 mins of the 1st dose i passed some big long blood clots but im not sure what it was because it fell in the toilet as i was pooping. I felt better.



3:44 pm

i took the 2nd dose. I mistakenly set the timer to 3 hrs and 30 mins because i was so out of it during that time. I started using the napkin diaper thing (i didnt know they had these now since i use a menstrual cup whenever i get my period. I was amused and it was SO COMFORTABLEi should have bought two packs. I hate napkins) 

I noticed something hanging outside my vagina. I didnt pull it. The pain and chills were low and bearable so i continued sleeping.



7:18 pm

I woke up and pooped and cleaned. The thing hanging outside has gotten longer but it hast fully passed.  
Afterwards i took my 3rd dose. Im bleeding less and less now so im worried. The cramps doesnt hurt  


After waking up around 3:00 AM 

I pooped the thing still hasnt passed. And not bleeding as much. I tried to wait it out or push it but it wasnt working. I tried to pull it out (i shoudnt have) but it just ripped. It like greyish clear like with deep dark reds?? Im not good at describing.

Afterward around 4:16 am i took my 4th dose. I keep reading and look up situations similar to mine. 



10:03 am 

I got an email from WoW saying i should take the last 2 pills. And the abortion is in process.

As im writing this, im not bleeding at all anymore and im still sure theres still some inside. Im worried about the bleeding part since im not bleeding at all. I can feel my uterus rumbling and cramps that doesnt hurt but thats it. And whenever i sit at our sofa i feel a firm pressure for a moment inside.

It might sound ridiculous, but I think of names and silently mourn what could have been. I know now that it was the best decision for myself.

i think i made the mistake of saying yes to certain things while i was getting screened for my abortion (ie an ultrasound, and knowing the gender of the baby). i was with my bf, and it was hard for the both of us. we both want a family, but i made the decision to have the abortion because i felt like i wasnt ready. it was a hard week, of experiencing the short joys of knowing that we could have a family, but then following up with the immediate heartbreak that it wasnt the right time. 

anyways, i did gain 15lbs during that time, and i was wondering if the bloating goes down after the procedure, or if my body will go back to its normal distribution. my stomach is still a bit bloated and squishy, so thats something thats been plaguing my mind. 

and on the other hand, i feel incredibly sad. i know i did what i think was best for me and my situation, but& i feel guilty. i kinda miss the baby? in a way? i miss feeling that connection, the kicks, the movements? i woke up from my surgery to my stomach being flat and squishy, and that made me sad. but i feel like thats wrong& like i shouldnt be feeling this bad about a decision i made. ive been catching myself thinking more about having a family and the what ifs on if i kept the baby and that makes me more sad. i want a family, i really do& and i catch myself getting really upset at myself for not being ready sooner. i dont know if this is normal, and i dont know what to do with all of these feelings.

This is my second pregnancy and I was in touch with a previous local seller that made my first abortion successful, this time their pills didnt work.

"" My first day of period was January 30, I took a test on March 9 testing negative. And by March 15, a faint positive line.

I have decided to not trust the local seller Ive been in contact with anymore, as I do not want to risk another failed MA. The local seller told me they will give me a higher dosage but double the price. Ive decided to remove contact with my local seller and reach out to these three reliable sources (whw, wow, s2c - fpop) and will be sharing my experience.

WoW
MARCH 24: I contacted them and sent an email, theyve reached out to me for a donation.

MARCH 25: I told them about my financial situation and they asked me how much I could donate and they will support me. I said ¬24 as I am in debt already. No response yet.

WHW
March 24: I contacted them and they were very responsive to me. Ive told them about my financial situation and they asked if I could donate ¬50 but I am still incapable of doing so.

March 25: Ive reached out to them and told them I could only afford ¬24. No response yet.

s2c - FPOP
March 24: I contacted the hotline given to me in the s2c chatbot thru tg (telegram) and like previously said by other users, was greeted by a nurse that said they do not sell these specifically but knows someone who does.

Offering the same price to me such as the other users of 3.3k
"" 3,000 for meds 
"" 100 for her transportation
"" 200 for shipping as I am not located in Metro Manila 

Now my concern with FPOP is that they require a TVS (transvaginal ultrasound) scan. It has been 3 days since I took the local seller pills and it only led me to have a mild diarrhea with medium flow bleeding, which is now getting lighter. I am worried that if I get a TVS scan, they will find out I took pills. How many days should I wait to get a tvs scan? 


Bottom line, I am leaning more onto FPOP as it will only take a few days to arrive. Ive also talked to and read the posts of other users that had an experience with FPOP pills. I am just really worried with how to deal with the TVS, because I am still bleeding from the local MA pills. But I also would want a back up incase FPOP doesnt work on me, which is why I considered WoW and WHW. My partner encourages on FPOP since it will only take a few days, and he doesnt want to risk losing the package if we order from whw or wow or risk waiting weeks to get them.

This was a tough experience not just physically, but mentally too and knowing I made the right decision for my partner and I is comforting. Im not going to sugarcoat it, but the experience was painful. I mean the worst pain Ive ever experienced. This isnt meant to scare any of you, but to be realistic. I too was reading Reddit articles of people at 4 weeks and their experiences also thinking since Im not far along maybe this wont be so bad. I was wrong, but I do not regret my choice.
I found out I was pregnant last Monday. I was feeling a bit nauseated (I went out that weekend and thought maybe it was from drinking over the weekend). I texted my partner that I was going to take a test because I felt off. A few minutes later and there it was: the word pregnant on the stick. Immediate panic and fear kicked in and I started to sob uncontrollably. My partner and I knew a baby wasnt in our plans right now so we immediately made the decision to end the pregnancy as soon as possible. We made a few phone calls the next day and I made an appointment for a medical abortion that Friday.

When we first got to planned parenthood, the sight of protestors outside honestly scared the crap out of me. I hadnt felt much guilt, but seeing them made me feel guilty but I knew deep down the decision I made was the right one. Had a pleasant experience at PP. They asked about date of my last period and determined I was about 4 weeks and mentioned that if they couldnt find any visual of a sac on an ultrasound then Id have to come back the following week. Luckily, when ultrasound time came they were able to find it (thank god because I had the weekend off from work and wanted time to recover and to have it done asap). I took the first pill in the office there at 1:30pm. I felt fine after it and resumed on with my normal activities for the day. The doctor gave me a printout to take home with me with directions for the following day as well as pain meds, anti-nausea meds, the 4 dissolvable pills and strong ibuprofen. 

The next day I followed the directions as written. At 5:30 I ate a light dinner. At 6, I took my pain meds and anti nausea meds. At 7 I placed the 4 dissolvable tablets under my tongue. This is when trouble hit. About 10 mins in, I got some pretty serious cramps. Then at about 7:23, I threw up. Im talking throw up all over myself. Completely covered in it, in so much pain from cramps folded over on the toilet. It was horrible. My sister came to help me and my partner too. They helped change me and get me in the shower where I continued to squat down folded over in hot water. I also continued to throw up. Luckily for me, majority of the pills were dissolved by the time I puked, and I was feeling pain so I knew they were working. These were beyond period cramps. Active labor cramps are intense and I was in tears for about an hour. Once I got out, I had the chills and was shaking as I got into bed with my heating pad (but one, best purchase). At this point I hadnt puked in a while so I took more pain meds. I also started spotting around this time. I felt okay for about an hour until the pain returned. I tried to take an ibuprofen at this point (with food). About 30 minutes later I was back in the bathroom puking and hunched over again. I was in tears because the pain was so bad. I also started passing clots during this time and they were pretty big. After sitting there for a while I was basically dry heaving with nothing left. Eventually I took 3 basic Advil and the pain subsided after about 30 mins. Eventually I made it back to bed where I cuddled up with my heating pad and laid there. I set reminders for the next few hours to alternate pain meds and advil. All of this went on till about 12am which is when the worst of the pain was over. I experienced 2 major waves of pain about an hour and a half long each.

Overall, it was a painfully traumatizing experience. Ive never experienced pain like that in my life and hope to never experience it again. I was lucky to have my sister and partner there helping me through it, and I recommend having someone that you trust to be there with you, even if its just to rub your back while youre puking. You WILL get through it though. Its going to hurt and its going to be an awful few hours, but just know the choice you made for yourself was the right one and it will be okay.","abortion",1,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jiyqwd/ma_at_4_weeks/"

Usually i am pretty bitchy ill admit it, but this week ive just been emotional. I cried because i couldnt open a jar of pickles and i really wanted a pickle. I have been the opposite of bitchy or having an attitude. He snapped on me the other day and i just said  you have an attitude and you need to chill out and he proceeded to say that ive had an attitude all week which is not true. I was very affectionate with him after we found out and then ive gotten very emotional since but i havent been bitchy to him. I simply just said  ive been crying not bitchy but even then im fucking pregnant and have a lot of hormones and emotions going through my body. I just feel like he thinks of this as something as easy as having a cold or a bad day . Ive been so nauseous that i cant not take zofran everyday. My cramps have been terrible. And i work a physical job so having to throw a 900 piece grocery load while emotional and pregnant hasnt been easy for me. 

My boyfriend works overnights so he came home around 7 am and we left for my appt shortly after because it was at 8:20am. When we got there he had to wait in the waiting room cause they were just trying to get my weight , blood pressure , ect. He texted me and asked if he couldnt be in there with me and i said i wasnt sure. They had a lot of personal questions to ask. So after my vaginal ultrasound they said he could come back but i didnt think it would be much longer so i just let him wait in the waiting room. After the appointment they did give me a copy of the ultrasound which i didnt want at first but then i changed my mind. As we were leaving i asked if he wanted to see and he said yes and then the minute i showed him he was like  i dont want to fucking see that . I just was heartbroken. Like this is already a lot for me and i told him what an emotional toll this has taken on me and hes going day by day acting like everything is fine and normal . He just doesnt get it. I just feel like he hasnt cared how this is effecting me at all. We had to wait for an uber and he was like oh you wanna walk around next door till it comes ? i was like i just took an abortion pill im not really up for fucking walking around in public. Like i just feel like his situational awareness is none existent. 

Ive told him how im extremely nauseous or my cramps were really bad and he just choose to say nothing. Like i understand theres nothing he can do but at least acknowledge me ???? I took the pill at the office and i have to wait 24 hours to put the 4 in my cheek. I just feel like how he acts over the next two days will determine if i want to continue this relationship or not.

I read terrifying posts and thought I could share a different perspective to offer comfort during this uncomfortable time for women.

-The Mifepristone is simple and straightforward - no symptoms aside from very light cramping. Doctor gave me Lorazepam for anxiety and nerves (much needed!)

-I took the Misoprostol 24hrs later:
-12:30pm: prepped with 3 ibuprofen and 1 Zofran 

-1pm: melted 800mg Misorpostol inside cheeks

-2pm: light bleeding and cramps started

-3pm: more intense cramps and heavier bleeding - 2 more ibuprofen

-5pm: heavier bleeding with clots, peak cramps 6/10 on pain scale 

-8pm: substantial clotting, cramps subsiding - 1 more ibuprofen

-7am: no cramps, light spotting 

Overall, this felt like a very heavy period with clotting and more intense cramps. I never needed the Oxy for pain, and was able to tolerate the cramps with ibuprofen and heating pad. Sending support to anyone going through this now! You got this!

It took until 10pm for bleeding to start although the cramping began right away.

I was heavily bleeding and I forgot if there were many blood clots, but I dont really remember the feeling of passing any, and definitely just felt like a heavy heavy period.

Just wanted to post about my positive surgical abortion experience to help put anyone elses mind at ease. 

I found out I was pregnant on the 30th of March (totally unplanned, I am a dumb bitch and had been on the pill for 12 years, which I stopped at the end of 2023 just because - was loosely using condoms and tracking my cycle, a dumb bitch move. I just assumed I was infertile for some stupid reason =) 

I saw a GP the same day, she was great and explained my options - I had to get a blood test ASAP to confirm, then an ultrasound to confirm how far along I was. I went to the GP twice and thay was about $30 each time, the ultrasound cost about $170. I was then referred to my local hospital (regional Victoria), who booked me in for today, after speaking with the gynecologist on the phone - I would be 8.5 weeks. I am the most pro choice person in the world, but making the decision to terminate the pregnant was really hard. Lots of feelings of guilt, worrying about this being my only chance of getting pregnant. I am lucky to have been with my partner for 7 years, and he was supportive either way. I knew I was not ready to be a parent, were trying to save for a house and we have a 5 month old puppy, whos hard enough work! 

I went in at 11.30am today, a nurse asked me a bunch of questions and they gave me medication (panadol and something else to help soften the cervix??). I waited around until about 1.30pm (there were some delays) - in that time I met the gynecologist, anesthetist, and nurses who would be present (all lovely and mainly female), which put me at ease. I started to cry while being wheeled to theatre as Ive never been in hospital before, let alone had surgery - they were all reassuring and excellent. They gave me the drugs and in what felt like 2 seconds, I was awake again! I experienced slight cramping (nothing worse than mild period pain). I was allowed to leave at 3.30pm, and Im now resting at home! I pretty much feel fine, no cramping atm or anything. Im shocked I feel so normal!

Truly such an easy experience - the procedure itself was free of charge which was excellent. Ill be more vigilant with contraception now, as the next time I get pregnant Ill be keeping it. 

More than happy to answer any specific questions :) I was SO nervous about the whole process, literally cried most days leading up to it, but all the medical staff were amazing and so non judgmental, literally want to hug them all. I feel so grateful living in a country where we have safe and affordable access to abortions, as it should be.

FEB 28 - First PT Positive
"" Late ang Mens ko for one week, kinukutuban nako by this time lalo't lahat ng symptoms na magkakaron nako ay nararamdaman ko na pero hindi pa rin ako dinadatnan. 

MAR 1 - Second PT Positive + Ordered from local facebook seller
"" This time kasama ko partner ko nag-pt kami ng tatlong beses just to make sure at lahat nag positive. Yung friend ng partner may nirecommend na seller dahil daw may kaibigan na sila na bumili doon. Nag-order and pay na agad kami para habang shipping gagawin ko yung ""procedure"" kuno nila. 5th week pa lang din kaya medyo kampante kami na mag successful. 

"" Nagresearch ako niyan about MA and came across safe2choose/WOW. Kaso since nakapag order na nga, yun na lang yung pinanghawakan namin. Nung nalaman din kasi namin na need mag donate ng 50-70EUR, nadown kami both dahil akala namin required talaga magdonate ng ganong kalaking pera. Sabi na lang namin is that imemake sure namin na tama yung procedure. 

MAR 2-8 - Did the FB seller procedure
"" That time kumakapit lang kami sa testimony nung friend ng partner ko. Walang palya yung pagreready ko non as in pati yung 12hrs na fasting ginawa ko. At this point grabe yung symptoms ko, this week ko naramdaman lahat from bloating to hilo pati sakit ng dibdib. Nasa 6th weeks palang ako neto according sa calendar ng WOW. 

MAR 8-9 - Failed MA (from fb seller) 
"" Sinamahan ako ng partner ko and friend niya that time. Yung binigay na ""Mife"" samin ay nasa isang plastic lang then yung rotec Miso and 4 pills na Medione (iinumin daw to after mag success).

After ko gawin yung ""procedure"" ng 7hrs, nag cr ako para umihi and dumumi (7hrs naka elevate yung pwetan ko and bawal umihi and dumumi). May lumabas na parang gelly type sakin with blood pero hindi ko talaga sure kung ano yun dahil sa bowl ako napaihi. Ang sabi nung seller, di pa daw successful dahil nga wala pa daw nakikitang sac. 

By this point sobrang naiiyak na rin ako dahil after a long week preparation, alam kong hindi naging successful. Almost a day or two lang ako dinugo and after ay spotting na lang. May lumalabas pa rin na clot from time to time pero hindi malalaki. 

MAR 10-22 - Symptoms + Pahinga
"" After that, napagkasunduan namin ng partner ko na maghintay ng 2 weeks and if andon pa rin ang mga symptoms ko, oorder na ako sa WOW. Nagconsult na ako sa kanila before pero hindi ko tinuloy dahil nga sa donation. Pinagpahinga niya rin ako dahil emotionally sobrang tagilid ako. I have a strong personality talaga kasi but at that time hindi ko kinaya at iniyak ko sa kanya lahat. 

"" Nasa 8th week palang din ako non and WOW says na kaya pa naman iship. Nag-email ako sa kanila regarding sa situation ko and if ever pwedeng nasa 35EUR lang ang madonate. Nagreply din sila agad na it's totally okay as the donation is only to make sure that the organization can sustain itself. 

"" After just 2 days of back and forth na email with them, they emailed us back the shipment information and nakalagay don na 8-10 days bago makuha ang package. 

(Here's the unsual parts...) 

MAR 23 - APRIL 5 - Waiting + Bleeding
"" I know na matagal talaga pero panatag ako neto dahil after 3 days nakita ko na rin naman sa tracker yung package. May mga delays pero I just trust sa mga nakikita ko dito sa subreddit regarding sa shipping. 

"" Here sa 2 weeks na to nagtataka ako. Naglalabas pa rin ako ng clot pero maliliit lang and again spotting rin, this is from March 24 til March 26. After that sumakit ngipin ko and suspetya ko ay dahil sa wisdom tooth. Yung sakit by that time is 8/10 kaya napainom nako ng Mefenamic Acid. Niresearch ko if okay lang ba yun sa buntis and sinabi na hindi daw. I just let it be since ang sakit talaga. Humilab yung tiyan nung uminom ako ng Mefenamic, naka anim din ata ako in the span of three days.

"" Then the tricky part is dinugo ako (may lumalabas din na kakaunting blood clot) after ko uminom ng Mefenamic. Kinakabahan ako neto kasi ayoko talaga magka infection. Again, I just let it be kasi masakit talaga ngipin and baka dahil lang sa failed MA ko. 

APRIL 6 - 12 - MA (pills from WoW) 
"" Na receive ko yung package ng monday (april 7). May shipping fee siya na 112. 

"" Kinagabihan nagusap kami ng partner ko kung kailan ko pwedeng iinom yung pills within the week dahil by this point 11 weeks nako. I decided na gabi ng Thursday na lang para madaling araw ng Saturday ko matetake yung 2nd to last dose ng Miso. Here's the sched na ginawa ko: 

[10PM Thursday Mife 

( 9PM Friday 2pcs Medicol ) 

10PM Friday First dose 
1AM Saturday Second 
4AM Saturday Third 
7AM Saturday Fourth 
10AM Saturday Fifth ]

 APRIL 10 - 11 - Mifepristone 
"" Ang unusual thing na nangyari sakin is that sa Mife ako sobrang tinablan. After ko uminom by 10, may bleeding na agad but minimal palang. Sabi naman din is that usually nagbibleed na talaga sa Mife palang. 

So again, since minimal pa lang I decided na kinabukasan papasok ako ng school. Pagpasok ko pa lang ng school namumutla nako sa init and pagod. Nararamdaman ko na nagcacramps ako pero hindi pa ganon kalakas. And lumalakas na rin yung bleeding to the point na need ko na magpalit ng napkin kahit pa all night na yung gamit ko non. 

Nung nakapagpalit ako, dun ko naramdaman yung gush ng bleeding and cramps. As in yung cramps parang contraction siya na lulubog lilitaw, merong interval na 5mins every cramps. Sobrang sakit and naramdaman ko na ang daming cloth na lumabas. 

Umuwi na agad ako and otw home sobra sobrang sakit talaga. Yung sakit is 15/10 nahihilo and nanginginig na rin ako sa sakit non. Pero hindi ko pinapansin dahil dalawa lang ang nasa utak ko non, (1) Ayaw ko mapunta ng hospital and (2) Gusto ko makauwi. Buti na lang 15mins away lang yung bahay namin sa school kaya nakauwi din ako agad. 

Kumuha lang ako ng panibagong napkin and deretcho agad ako sa cr and doon pagkaupo na pagkaupo ko sa bowl, lumabas lahat ng clot at todo bleed talaga. Yung cramps andon pa rin and alam ko na agad na need ko uminom ng Ibuprofen. For almost 10minutes hinayaan ko muna lumabas lahat nung gusto ilabas ng body ko. 

Malalaki yung blood clot na lumabas pero hindi kasing laki ng orange. Sobrang dami din ng blood and honestly napuno ko agad yung isang pad. Again ayoko talaga mapunta sa hospital so hinayaan ko lang :(( 

Nung medyo nafeel ko na kaya kong makakilos kahit super onti, Nagbihis agad ako and inom ng Ibuprofen 400mg. Nagpabili djn ako ng gatorade and lugaw (ang akala lang ng fam ko ay grabe ang menstruation ko). 

Mga 15mins (or more??) Bago tumalab yung Ibuprofen. Ramdam na ramdam ko pa rin yung cramps pero bearable na siya para sakin (mataas pain tolerance ko). Malala pa rin yung bleeding and paglabas ng clot. For almost 6hrs ata nakadalawang palit ako ng napkin. 

 APRIL 11 - 12 - Miso
"" Pagpatak ng 10PM non, tinake ko na yung first dose. Expected ko na na baka masakit dahil kung sa Mife pa nga lang ganon na reaksyon ng body pano pa sa Miso. But unexpectedly actually hindi naging ganon kasakit yung Miso. Yes may cramps but not as painful as naranasan ko sa Mife. Nung first to third dose minimal bleeding lang and onting cloth. Then sa last doses dumami onti yung bleeding and may mga clot. 

Sa totoo lang akala ko wala ng lalabas na clot lalo na grabe yunh nilabas ko sa Mife pero parang buong bituka ko ata gusto ilabas ng katawan ko = 

After taking the last dose, on and off na yung paglabas ng clot and bleeding. Kinagabihan din ng 12, nakita ko na may lumabas na matabang blood clot sl (sorry if nakakadiri) hinawakan ko and tiningnan kung ano yun, sobrang kapal lang niya na parang piece of meat.

Right now 3 days POST MA, nawala na yunh bloating and constipation ko. Kaso natatakot pa rin ako na baka hindi naging successful lalo na hindi ko talaga nakita na may sac kahit pa sa second MA ko. Ang email lang ng WOW sakin ay ""it's likely that your MA is successful if you expel a lot of clot"" somewhere aling those lines. 

Hindi ko rin alam if paranoid lang ba or nah. I'm planning to have TVS after holy week. Pinapahinga lang din yung sarili since emotionally and mentally hindi ako okay. Sobrang drain lang din now kaya parang ano man yung result, parang hindi nako mawiwindang hahahaha. 

Yun lang naman, this serves as a lesson to me and my partner din. I don't know if makakahelp din tong post ko to anyone but yeah sharing it to warn some of you din about scammers. Wag na wag kayong bumili kahit pa anong sabihin nila, it's better to research and contact trusted organizations. 

Thankful din sa mga nakilala ko dito and sa mga nagche check up on me on my inbox kahit pa hindi ko kilala. Like really sobrang thank you po. Mahigpit na yakap sa lahat. ","abortion",2,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jzhzdw/my_unusual_usual_ma_experience/"
"506",506,"i never imagined the wave of emotions","2025-04-15",1744680880,"i never imagined the wave of emotions","fair warning, this is more of a rant. i have so many emotions i havent discussed with anyone but they need to be said somewhere.

i got an abortion on the 11th after i found out on the 4th. i went in thinking i was 7 weeks which meant i could get the pill.

turns out i was 12.2 weeks and i had to get the surgery. i saw what the ultrasound looked like which im not sure if i shouldve seen it now that its all over. i wonder if it made the aftermath more difficult to deal with.

day to day now, i find myself so lonely. i mean, the situation was the same before: two cats and just me living alone. but idk why i feel lonely. like i left something behind at the clinic. my mother says that the energy of the baby is still here, just the physical aspect of it is gone. im not sure that helps because i have 5 billion other emotions coming up too.

i do feel regret. that i didnt try and fight to make sure this baby wouldve had a great future, but i also have conflicting feelings. the father is a narcissist that wouldve tried to gain full custody in the future and wouldve alienated me. 

i also feel a little relieved. like i really wasnt ready to be a mother, not yet. when the time is right, i will be again.

but mostly, i just feel sad. like i just want to cry all the time. i try to go and get some sun, but in a split second, i just want to cry all over again. i cant get away from it and idk when itll stop.

i took a break from social media besides reddit and decided to read instead to pass the time. its the only thing that distracts me enough. but i go back to work tomorrow and all my coworkers think i went on vacationnot to handle my emergency. 

how do i get through the next few days, weeks, idek how long when i see three of my coworkers abt to have babies? one is just 5 years older than me and i see her bump grow practically every week. it made it hard before i even got the abortion. only 3 people know at work what i went on PTO for and the last thing i want is how are you doing.

its not peoples fault, but i legitimately hate being asked that when im trying to suppress my emotions in a professional setting. hell, i almost burst into tears going into the chiropractor because i knew my back pain was better because i was no longer pregnant.

i wish i was in a different situation where i couldve been able to keep my baby. i will one day but i guess i have to feel the pain now to have gratitude when i can again.

sorry for the long rant. its been bottling up and i didnt even realise until now. if youre feeling similar to me, just know youre not alone. this shit is hard and i dont think anyone couldve prepared me for it.","abortion",1,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jzfuje/i_never_imagined_the_wave_of_emotions/"

80% of me wanted to get an abortion but I am very scared. 20% of me wanted to keep this baby because this is what me and my partner has been longing for.

I have no family and trustworthy female friends in this country. I have no practical and financial support from anyone.  My partner is actually very sweet but most of the time he is very selfish when it comes to practical matter and has a really explosive anger issue. I feel alone and depressed.

I took a pregnancy test at home with my partner and had it verified at planned parenthood a couple days later. I scheduled an appointment for a medication abortion that same week and had my partner at the appointment. Here is a brief breakdown of how it went. 

I got to the clinic and after checking in the technician took my blood pressure, height, and weight. I asked if my partner could come with me but she said after the intake was done. She asked me if i wanted an STI test, verified some information, and confirmed I wanted to proceed with the abortion. After this, i undressed from the waist down while they brought my partner back. 

Once my partner came in, the technician went over the process, the risks, and explained the names of the medications i'd be taking. They handed me a packet with all the information and instructions for taking them. The nurse then came in, gave me an ultrasound that measured the pregnancy at 5 weeks and 3 days and asked if i wanted a copy or to see the still on the screen. She asked if I had been experiencing any pain or cramping and then left for me to get dressed. 

When she returned, I took the first pill (1), which stops the pregnancy from growing. The other pills (4) started the abortion and you either let them dissolve between your gums and cheeks 24 hours after taking the first pill or insert them vaginally any time after you take the first pill. Both must happen before 48 hours. 

They also prescribed ibuprofen for the pain and promethazine for any nausea, which you must take 30 minutes before you take the next 4 pills. My cramping started 1.5 hours after I inserted the 4 pills vaginally, and the bleeding 30 minutes after that. The blood flow was not intense, more like the 1st or 2nd  day of my period and the cramps were only a little less painful than my typical cramping. At times, i had some pretty big blood clots that mostly came out when i peed. More than anything, i felt fatigued and a little confused or loopy, like when you first wake up from a nap. I used a heating pad to help with the cramping and slept as much as i could. 

One weird side effect that began maybe 10-12 hours after, was really painful breasts. It was a burning sensation that I only felt when they were pressed on too hard or moved around too much. This has lasted roughly 3 days but has gone down. I am still bleeding (like day 3 of my period) but the cramps have almost stopped completely. 

I used overnight super absorbent pads the first 2 days for extra coverage and to feel as dry as possible. I've used tampons today (day 3). I recommend not freaking yourself out with the videos online and resting! ","abortion",2,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jypt1o/i_was_5_weeks_and_6_days_when_i_got_an_abortion/"

-could I be pregnant after medical abortion-
I had a MA 3 weeks ago. I took the test they gave me thinking it had already been 4 weeks and it came back positive right away with two bright lines. So I took a store bought test and it also came back positive with a second faint line. After realizing it had actually only been 3 weeks I was a little less freaked out. The problem is however I have had sex the past 3 weeks. Knowing you are fertile again right  after the abortion, I took a plan b after each time. But my breasts are swollen and tender again, I feel bloated and fatigued, Ive been craving sweets, and I noticed some brown-ish discharge in my underwear today and those are normally early signs of pregnancy for me so Im just scared I could be pregnant again already and obviously I dont want to be or want to have a child so that would just really suck and the uncertainty is killing me.

Friday on April 11th I was about 5 weeks and 4 days pregnant. I had everything done at my local Planned Parenthood and I wouldnt have done it any other way. I went to this appointment by myself and opted for the SA because I knew I could get the IUD immediately after the SA was finished. 

10:20 am: Time my appointment started, this started off with payment and paperwork. I paid $435 out of pocket because unfortunately it was more expensive running it through my insurance. However, my IUD was 100% covered. I opted for the Liletta hormonal IUD. 


10:40 am: I went up for my ultrasound. My nurse was amazing. Extremely comforting and did everything she could to make be safe and less lonely because I was at this appointment by myself. She asked if I wanted to see the ultrasound and if I wanted a copy of anything. I did look at my ultrasound- however, did not end up keeping a copy. 

11:00am: After my ultrasound I waited about 15-20 minutes to meet with the healthcare counselor. Once we met, we discussed disclosures and just asked me questions about my well being. We also checked my pulse, BP, and blood type. 

11:20am: Final check in to wait for the actual procedure. This was probably the hardest part. The anticipation of waiting for them to call you back. I tried watching one of my usual shows but nothing seemed to calm my nerves. The nurse called me back and had me take a 800mg ibuprofen and 2 pills to prevent infections. Then I went back out to the waiting room to wait until 15-20 minutes for the medications to kick in. 

11:40am: Time for the procedure. I had 3 healthcare workers in the room with me. 2 doctors and 1 medical assistant. The doctors did an amazing job at just calming me down and walking me through the procedure. Once the actual procedure started from start to finish along with putting in my IUD it probably took 8-10 minutes. After she put the speculum in she gives me 3 shots of lidocaine in my cervix to numb. This was probably the most painful part. It was just a weird uncomfortable sensation. Nothing too bad though. After the numbing kicked in thats when the dilation and suctioning starts. This just felt like very heavy period cramps. I would rate it about a 6.5/10. The doctors did a really good job at talking me through to keep me focused on something else. The functioning lasted about 3 minutes and then it was time for the IUD. I did not feel this at all. Probably because I was a little in shock and it didnt compare to the actual SA itself. 

About 10-15 minutes after: a side effect of the lidocaine shots are dizziness and nausea. I did get hit with this pretty badly in the recovery room. I threw up and my BP dropped. The nurses kept me comfort in the recovery room and constantly checked on me. I was given a zofran, bag of pretzels, and ice pack to cool me down. Usually you can leave the recovery room after 15 minutes but they wanted to see my BP come back up so I stayed for about 45 minutes. 

12:45: around this time I felt better enough to leave. They ask you go to the bathroom before to check bleeding, so I did and I had none. My cramps were almost completely gone and I felt normal. I walked to my car and drove about an hour home and even stopped at target after for some self care shopping. 

Its now Sunday and Ive experienced minimal cramping and bleeding. Just some shedding of my uterus lining and pregnancy tissue. I feel like I can go back to my normal life and Im very lucky to have recovered this fast and well. Thank you to the staff of planned parenthood. They got me through this and were amazing!

Just wonderinghow did you guys donate, and how much is usually okay to give? Also, how mucj did you pay for the pills? Im on minimum wage, so I really have to stick to a budget.

Hopefully, someone will be able to answer my questions. Thank you!","abortion",4,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jxbuv0/how_much_did_you_donate_on_wow/"
"529",529,"Experience with Abuzz Abortion at 7 weeks","2025-04-12",1744436277,"Experience with Abuzz Abortion at 7 weeks","I am a 28F married for almost three years. I found out I was pregnant on Sunday March 30th. I cried so badly because I knew I didnt want to be a mom yet. My husband and I have plans of having kids in the future but we werent ready just yet! I told my husband about it and he supported me in the decision to end it. I immediately went online to find ways to end the pregnancy. I scheduled an appointment at Planned Parenthood for Tuesday April 1st . However, I also found Abuzz online. I started reading other peoples experiences on Redditt about using Abuzz and it looked very legit. I went through their website and paid $100 for the pills (beware that this is a for-profit organization, so they really want you to pay the full fare, but you can pay as much as you can for the pills. You are not required to pay the full price if you cannot afford it, but they will try and encourage you to pay as much as you can). My pills were delivered on Friday April 4th.
On Tuesday April 1st I went to my appointment at PP. I had an appointment for an abortion, but I felt disappointed as I was simply given information that I already knew and had looked up on my own. I genuinely thought they were going to at least do an ultrasound, but they didnt. They made me pay $30 for the visit which normally goes towards the total cost of the procedure. To my surprise, the prices for an abortion in PP were extremely high even for low income and no insurance people. The price in Utah for an in-clinic abortion was about $550 if you were on the earliest stage of the pregnancy. The cost for the abortion pill was exactly the same as the in clinic procedure(which didnt make much sense to me). They explained to me that the day of the procedure is the same day they do the ultrasound to check if the pregnancy is in the uterus. 
On a side note: I overheard one lady who was trying to get a pregnancy test there, but the nurse was explaining to her that the cost for that at the clinic was $120, but that they used the same type of at home tests you can buy at the pharmacy for much less. That was wild to me.
I decided I was just going to do the abortion pill at home from Abuzz, but I wanted to take an ultrasound to make sure that the pregnancy was indeed in my uterus. I scheduled a midwife appointment for Wednesday April 9th, and the doctor confirmed the pregnancy was in the right place and everything looked normal.
Later that Wednesday night, at around 9:45 pm, I took a pill of Mifepristone, I sat on the couch and set a timer for 15 minutes to make sure I wasnt going to pass out or feel too bad. After 15 minutes I was completely fine. I finished some homework, did some reading and went to bed at around 11:45 pm.
Next day on Thursday April 10th I woke up feeling a little nauseous, but that is how I have been feeling anyway from the pregnancy symptoms. I had a normal day, with a few of the symptoms of my pregnancy still there, but nothing really new. I went to school and I also worked at the restaurant that day.
On Friday April 11th at 10:30 am I laid down in bed and brought with me everything I read I should need: acetaminophen, ibuprofen, water, pedialyte, crackers, and my heating pad. I was also wearing this extra large menstrual pads. I inserted the 4 Misoprostol pills in my vagina. I followed the instructions and stayed laying down for 30 mins to make sure the pills were absorbed into my uterus. The symptoms went like this:

First 30 mins: nothing really, no cramps nothing 
11:54 am light cramps that came and go 
12 noon took 600 mg of ibuprofen 
12:16 cramps are starting to get worse 3/10
12:37 cramps are getting worse and I have a mix of nausea and wanting to poop 5/10 pain
12:50 pm I went to the bathroom to throw up twice and then pooped. Cramps are horrible and pain is like 6/10.
1:17 pm I was laying in bed and threw up twice again (mostly yellow liquid since all I had been eating was crackers and water so there was nothing in my stomach) I felt slightly better right after doing that  but cramps are still high and pain is at 8/10
2:56 pm I just woke up from a long nap, I was able to sleep until now that I woke up. After that last vomit I felt I let everything out and lost a lot of energy so I almost immediately felt asleep and cramps pretty much disappeared after it. After waking up, I realized I do still have some light light cramping but it feels like nothing compared to what I went through earlier. Pain is very tolerable so Ill give it 1/10.
3:10 took 500 mg of acetaminophen 
4:10 pain is 2/10 still tolerable and Ive been eating crackers and pedialyte without throwing up 
5 pm and pain is 3/10, it has increased slightly but Ive been able to eat and not throw up 
6pm took 600 mg of ibuprofen and cramps continue to be stable, pain is between 2-3/10
7pm I am eating my first official meal and Ive been doing well. I ate only rice and chicken. Cramp pain is only 1 sometimes 2 out of 10. I havent had any nausea 
7:45: I went to the bathroom to pee and expelled the biggest amount of blood. It was a very dark dark red matter and I couldnt see any fetus because they had told me it was of the size of a pea, so it would have gotten lost in all the blood that was expelled. 
9:30 pm took 500 mg of acetaminophen and feeling pretty good overall just very very light cramps. 
11:28 pm I have been watching tv all day with a blanket and my heater. I feel very tired so Im trying to not go to work tomorrow. I thought this process was going to be a lot worse, its been difficult and painful nonetheless. Medicine has helped. 

I read that the earlier you are in the pregnancy the easier and less painful it is. I hope my experience serves others who are looking for some sort of relief and reassurance in this process. I hope you are doing ok and remember you are strong and brave for whatever decision you make! d","abortion",3,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jxa8wn/experience_with_abuzz_abortion_at_7_weeks/"

Today I barely had any, so I popped in a tampon. And Ive now been seeing red blood. 

Should I be worried? Should I stop using tampons? 

My OB never told me how long to expect to bleed and what is normal , I feel like only bleeding for a week is pretty unusual. 

But Im ready to have sex again, please dont judge me. But I dont want to if its going to cause excessive bleeding or if having brown, and then suddenly it turning red is concerning.

I had been extremely nervous/scared. I have had three pill abortions before this so I was SUPER disappointed in myself now that I got pregnant again. My first appointment was just getting my blood check and signing consent documents. I was expecting to have to go through the pill process again but the nurse had explained to me how the procedure goes. The nurse herself had gotten the procedure before and told me that if I could handle the pain of the pill (which I will say was top three worst pains of my life) then I could definitely handle the procedure. I thought to myself- whats worse 5 hours of excruciating pain or 5 minutes? I had about a week until my next appointment so I had time to think about it. A week later, my appointment came. I had decided to go through with the procedure and before I explain my experience, I will preface by saying I am so happy I went with the procedure instead of the pill. I was mainly scared of the procedure since being in a room alone surrounded by medical staff and the pain as well. My appointment was at 11:30 am. I left the office at 4 pm, so expect to spend a few hours at the office. They give you three options for the procedure and pain. 1- just ibuprofen/pain meds (free) 2- laughing gas (35$) 3- IV sedation(75$) and I decided with sedation since I wanted it to be the least painful possible. I paid my balance which was 650$+75$ and waited. About an hour later, the nurses brought me back to check my vitals and have me go over consent documents and if I planned to use any birth control. They ask you security questions and tell you what to expect for the procedure. I went back out to the waiting room, ate and waited for my turn. I believe around 2:30/3pm they called me back. My heart was beating out my chest. They brought me to the recovery room and sat me down and prepared me for the IV. I had already taking zofran in the morning for nausea, so they just gave me an antibiotic to avoid infections. They gave me a pad since I was told to expect bleeding after the procedure. There were other girls in the room, most of the girls seemed relatively fine after the procedure which made me feel better until they wheeled a girl in crying which made me ABSOLUTELY scared. My heart starting beating even faster and I was very scared. I scrolled through Reddit and tried to calm myself. Eventually it was my turn (I was last of course). They brought me to the room and told me to undress. When the nurses and doctor came in the room and were about to begin, I broke down in tears because I was extremely scared. Thankfully all the nurses and doctor were SUPER supportive and really made me feel better. They did the IV which took a few seconds to kick in. The procedure itself was painful but A LOT less than expected. I didnt even cry from the pain- I would say 5/10. It took a few minutes and once she was done I got extremely sweaty and hot due to the IV and was really tired. I had very slight cramps but not bad at all. They wheeled me back to the recovery room and gave me soda and chips. I slept for about 30 min and they checked my vitals twice in those
Thirty min. They ask how much you bled, which I lightly bled. I was able to get up and walk out. You do need someone to drive you home, since youre kind of out of it afterwards. Going home I barely had any cramps or pain at all. I would say 2/10 pain. But overall, Im really satisfied with the procedure and I wish I knew it was an option the first three times. If youre feeling scared about the procedure, I hope this makes you feel easier about it. Being a woman sucks, Im just glad we have the option to have our choice.

10:50a- cramping subsided significantly but still there 1

11:15a-more cramping 4- some blood 

11:30a- no cramping

12-1:30p: severe cramps 5 and some nausea. No vomiting

1:55p vomiting/bleeding/contraction like cramping  5

2:50p- ibuprofen, diarrhea, contraction like cramping 5, bleeding

3:30p- had one final contraction that was more painful than the rest, we were glad it stopped there as we were about to call the doctor

4:41p- still cramping but calming down

5:15p- cramping subsided significantly feeling hungry, bleeding more

8:00pm- my body is sore and tired but the cramping as pretty much calmed to a 0

I have made a post before my abortion as to just talk and explained my situation. Long story short my very long term bf was cheating on me for a while and I found out at 15 weeks pregnant and my world shattered. After going back and forth many times with myself I decided to end my pregnancy as I was not ready emotionally or financially to be a single mom. Flash forward to my time of appointment I had to get a D&amp;E which is a 2 day procedure. The first day I was given the laminaria sticks which dilates the cervix. For that I did have cramping but with ibuprofen 800s and heating pads it wasnt worse then regular period cramps. The next day was the day of the termination and I had to be alone during it as the clinic didnt allow anyone else to be in the building. I was sedated for it and it was not painful. It was very fast and now it feels like a blur looking back at it. Physically I was fine, normal amount of bleeding, no cramping, I even went to work the next day. Its now 12 days later and I am just barely bleeding. Emotionally I have been through a lot. I feel guilty, selfish, shameful. I am grieving my life I had, grieving someone who is still alive as I went full no contact with my ex, and Im grieving my baby who was never born. I have a very great support system from friends and family but I have days I feel so alone as none of them went thru something like this and can only comfort so much. BUT I also feel free, I feel relief. I made the choice to start my life completely over and Im free of a bad relationship and a bad person who could have been tied to me for life. The emotions come and go, I had some milk come in and sent me spiraling. I have nightmares but when I wake up I feel relief my life is still mine to control. I have a hard time seeing people posting about their pregnancy, especially the ones who were around the same weeks I was. 
In the end I get sad about not having my daughter. I wanted a baby girl so bad but I could not give her a life I had and I dont want my child to have less then I did. I believe she will come back to me when the time is right and Im very lucky to be able to start my life over and take control. I have bad days but I also am starting to have good days. I can laugh and smile with my friends and family and I can also cry and break down with them. I know in time this will be better and I am keeping my spirits high that the future will let me be the mother I want to be, not the one I would have been forced to be. You are not alone, some people hide this in a closet and some are more opened. I told some people I terminated and I told some I just lost the baby.

My body was too weak to hold it, the same way it feels now. After years of trying and something finally working, I wish it could all be different. I'm planning on of course telling everyone this one passed away, but I'm afraid the guilt is gonna eat away at me too much for what could have been.

I'm currently almost 10 weeks, and got the pills from aid access at 9w 6d. But ever since 5 weeks, this thing has been physically killing me. I wish I was exaggerating when I say I go to bed thinking I won't wake up because the shortness of breath is SO bad no matter how I lie down. Hospital doesn't care even with high BP and higher than that BPM (before this mine was always low). They chalk it up to hormones (I believe there is an imbalance for sure) and say go to OB. Go to Ob and they say they won't give me any hormone testing until 14 WEEKS and go back to hospital if I feel worse.  Absolutely insane, I am NOT going to feel like this another 4 weeks! Nonetheless another trimester. On top of that I've already been bleeding for the past 2 weeks, but because it's not red they don't deem it concerning. I have barely any high hopes, which makes things easier but doesn't.

My MIL has treated me horribly, she even threw out the dress I wanted to take baby pictures in (it was candy corn striped and my baby was due around Halloween). I took it as a sign since she doesn't know but I am still understandably mad. She always talks about wanting a grandkid, but with the way she treats me (she's done and said worse than that ^) I feel like I'm only here to be some baby maker. I cant imagine she would even be happy, she'd just ridicule me because my life isn't set up to her standards right now. My Partner says we will try again next June-July and supports me no matter what I do, but everyone else in my family and his are against abortions. When I rant to anyone about my health in any way, they say the same things the doctors do. Except him. It's also so frustrating living with people who don't believe I have a choice. I know I do, but sometimes I wish my body would just get rid of it without me having to do anything. I just can't do it anymore.

I hope that in the future my body can be strong enough, and I can have alot more money. I say that cause I'm losing money because I can't work due to how much I feel I'll pass out. I'm just so frustrated and want to give up. I commend anyone who makes it this far, I just wish I could. How can I make my heart believe I'm doing the right thing, when my brain knows I am in many ways? Is there anyone else here who did it because of mainly the physical problems?

Also to add, I will be going to therapy, and my therapist advised against a baby as it was already. So at least there, I doubt I'll be judged.

For reference, this is my timeline:

April 7 3pm - took mife. Had spotting/bleeding after few hours


April 8 5:30-6pm - 4 miso under tongue then spitted. I felt cramps but not too intense for me, not too much bleeding.


April 8 9-9:30pm - 2 miso under tongue then swallowed.

After about 30 mins, cramps got more intense and heavy bleeding. Soaked 2-3 pads in a span of 2 hours. So much blood clots that I decided to just sit on toilet. As Im about to wash, I saw theres a huge clot/tissue hanging but Im so scared to hold it. Couldnt remove by bidet so I gathered all my force to push it out. I didnt see but my gut says thats it. After it fell, another batch of clot/tissue came out. I felt like I was peeing huge blot clots. Continuous heavy bleeding until it became just my normal heavy menstruation. I was able to sleep for an hour and woke up with soaked pads.


April 9 12:30-1am - 2 miso under tongue then swallowed

I know that the cramps became lighter because I was able to sleep til 7am. I wore a menstrual pants so I couldnt say how much the bleeding was. I woke up feeling normal and like nothing happened. Im unable to process the emotions yet but I dont feel the same.

Now Im contemplating if thats enough dose of miso or if I should finish all 12 miso&

"555",555,"Positive Surgical Abortion Experience","2025-04-10",1744253948,"Positive Surgical Abortion Experience","In the weeks leading up to my SA, I was constantly reading stories online about other people's experiences. Most of them were extremely negative and made my nerves worse. Thank God I had an extremely positive experience, and thought I would share here for other people who are worried about their SA. 

I was 6 weeks and 3 days. When I got to the clinic (Planned Parenthood) my partner and I walked in and were immediately sent to an iPad to add some more info to my paperwork and then quickly I was taken back for a few questions with an extremely kind and caring nurse. 

The room was dim and cozy, and she asked me questions like if I was confident in my decision,  if anyone was forcing me to make this decision, and what type of sedation I wanted (Nitrous or Valium). I chose Valium and she then took some vitals. She then asked if I wanted my partner to come back and be with me and I said yes, so she went and grabbed him and had him come sit with me. 

Then a few minutes later, her and another nurse came in and gave me an external ultrasound and I chose to look at the screen to see my pregnancy. After that was done (maybe 5 minutes), she gave me some wipes and I cleaned up and then they transferred me to another room where a different nurse came in and went through some more paperwork and gave me 800mg of ibuprofen, an antibiotic, and 10mg of Valium. She left and told me she'd be back in 30 minutes to check in on how I was feeling to see if the Valium had kicked in. 

30 minutes later my nurse came back, let me go to the bathroom, and then took me to the procedure room. We waited a few more minutes and I finally started to feel the Valium working. I was getting drowsy and a bit loopy, but nothing major. It definitely took away my anxiety and relaxed me. 

She came in, explained how she wanted me to undress, gave me a pad and a cover, and then also mentioned that the table that I would be on was heated and I could adjust the temperature to how I liked, which was amazing. I undressed and about a minute later the doctor and her came back in. 

The doctor explained what she was going to be doing as she was about to do everything. She gave me a pelvic exam, then inserted a speculum, and gave me the numbing shots into my cervix. While this is happening the nurse and doctor were being very talkative and chatty and it helped distract from the situation. 

The pelvic exam and the speculum insertion were not painful, hardly uncomfortable,  but I've had papsmears before and knew what to expect. The most uncomfortable and painful experience was the numbing shots. I think she did 2, maybe 3. The first one felt just like a little pinch. The second or third one was very painful, I'd say an 8 or 9 out of 10. I don't know how to explain the feeling except to say it felt like fire in my lower abdomen and a sharp stabbing pain. That only lasted for maybe 10 seconds and was over. Immediately she began the suction, using a handheld device since I was not so far along in my pregnancy. 

This felt slightly uncomfortable at times, but not painful for the most part. And the nurse was doing a great job of distracting me with light hearted chit chat. They did mention that the pain would get worse at the very end, and that is when I would know it was gonna be over. That was true, it got more uncomfortable toward the end but then it was done! It felt like maybe 5 minutes total. She took the vacuum and speculum out and I remained laying down while the nurse took more vitals. She then set some tissues and wipes out for me to clean up with and let me know she'd be waiting for me outside the door and I was in no rush to get dressed. 

I had no bleeding and was mildly crampy afterwards. It felt like mild period cramps. I told them my pain afterwards was a 4 out of 10. I got dressed and walked out and the nurse walked me to the recovery area where she sat me in a recliner, gave me cookies and juice and a heating pad and another nurse took some more vitals and talked me through aftercare. At this point my pain was 0. 

I'm home now, and have been home for about 7 hours and have pretty much no cramping and am just a bit spotty on my pad. She prescribed me 800 mg of ibuprofen but I haven't needed to take it. 

Overall the experience was great (considering the circumstances) and if I had to do it again I would. The staff were amazingly kind and understanding, and made me feel extremely safe and well taken care of. 

I hope my positive experience can help anyone struggling with anxiety about their situation. It is a tough decision to make, but I'm glad I made it, and if you need anyone to talk to this is definitely a safe space to do so =<7 ","abortion",1,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jvnzup/positive_surgical_abortion_experience/"

He has a girlfriend. He will absolutely want me to have an abortion. 

And I... I am not sure what I want. 

I absolutely would want another baby, but it feels like an impossible task. I have complicated pregnancies (that actually diminish in risk if I continue to have kids with the same person, so this is truly my last chance to have another baby). Our kids are 9 and 6, and this would mean starting ALL the way over, with nursing and diapers and daycare. But our kids are great. They're smart and sweet and funny. I like being a mom, my kids don't stop me from living my life, I had them to bring them along on my adventures. 

Plus, my ex is awful. My family and friends hate him because he doesn't take our kids enough (in their eyes-- I don't mind, I like having full custody). It would be humiliating to admit we slept together again. HIS family would also be disappointed (in me, specifically, they love the kids).

Financially, it would be... messy. I'm a substitute teacher and it's inconsistent work. I could get a job as a paraeducator, or I could go back to being a nanny and keep the new baby with me. There's a huge demand for affordable childcare in my area. I'm sure I could make it work, I'm scrappy, but it would be hard.

Hello,

After a dumb night out and a failed plan B, we found out my girlfriend was pregnant. My girlfriend and I opted for a MA at \~10 weeks. We are not in a legal state, so we opted to use aidaccess. She followed the procedures and the process seemed to mirror the description of a normal MA. Passed clots and blood, we thought it was successful. However, since then, she has been bleeding pretty frequently, more frequently than a period, ranging from light to heavy. Furthermore, she has taken pregnancy tests throughout this process, with days or weeks in between. 

We are reaching eight weeks tomorrow. In these tests, there is still the faintest line indicating that she is pregnant. Now, we are aware that these hormones can take a while to leave the system, but given the time, we feel concerned that the process was not successful. Supposedly the tests getting faint is a good sign, but the fact that she has yet to test completely negative is worrying to say the least. Her symptoms have mostly seemed to fade, but she is uncertain as she never felt she had many symptoms to begin with.

So this is the situation currently. At this time, she is nearing 19 weeks. There is not much more time for a SA if she is still pregnant. We can travel to get the procedure, but our best opportunity would be this weekend, anywhere from 3-5 days from now. 

Our questions to you are:

Given this description, do you think she is still pregnant?

Given this description, do you think the MA was only partially successful, that there is a chance she has retained part of the tissue?

Or, was the MA successful?

I lastly want to say thank you for your input. We are not medical professionals, so we feel unqualified to determine the success of this procedure. Given our location and time, whatever we decide is critical to her health and safety. We would have to travel to have an SA. Likely, it would be best to travel to even confirm if this procedure was successful, and if it was not, then how we could proceed as well. 

Any advice? Have any of you been in a similar situation and what was the outcome? 

Sincerely, 

Some very worried young adults","abortion",26,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1juilct/advice_needed_what_do_i_do_next_had_ma_but_tests/"

I found out I was pregnant around 5w4d, this was clearly a surprise as I just stopped bc and didnt even get my period. My husband is planning on getting a Vasectomy soon and  I was tired of being on the pill. I figured we could wait for my cycle to start and then do the rhythm method. We are 1 and done and both knew we were not interested in having more children. My first labor was also incredibly traumatic and I didnt want to go through that again. I still had lots of mixed feelings about it that we did talk and sort through and ultimately decided this was the best decision for me and our family. I got the pills online since my anxiety couldnt deal with handling protestors. They came in 5 days from order to at my front door. 

I took the mifepristone on Sunday around 8:30 am and didnt have any side effects.
Monday I ate some toast and a banana and took ibuprofen 800 at 9:00 am and then took the misoprostol pills at 9:30 am and let them dissolve under my tongue for the 30 mins then swallowed the rest. This wasnt awful but wasnt pleasant either. 

Almost immediately at 10 am I started feeling a dull achy cramps a 1/10 on the pain scale def there but not noticeable.  After about an hour I got up and sat on the toilet and immediately heard a large plop in the toilet that looked like a large clot and started bleeding. Surprisingly I took comfort in knowing this was working. I went and laid in the bed and my husband rubbed my back while I used the heating pad. I started to have slightly more intense cramps 4/10 and decided to get in the tub and that helped a bit I would get on the toilet every so often and see bleeding and clots coming out.  

The bath helped and Then I transitioned to the shower. This was around 2 pm the cramps never were unbearable or even painful at this point. After that I laid in the bed and did eventually nap for about 2 hours. I woke up and changed my pad and there was moderate bleeding. 

I ate some snacks, took a THC gummy and had dinner. All and all it seemed to have worked and I didnt have any crazy pain, I was prepared for the worst but my experience overall was mildly unpleasant.

What helped: 
A heating bad or taking a bath
Taking a ibuprofen before the medication 
Having water and snacks close by
Tv, books, etc for distraction 
I also had a garbage can in case I needed to vomit and extra towels down on my bed in case of lots of blood. ","abortion",2,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jubylz/ma_at_6_weeks_not_to_bad/"

I am not very open about my experience, unless it is with my partner then I tell him everything. I wonder does anyone mention the fact that they've had an abortion before to their medical doctor?

I really thought that by now I would be set in my decision to keep the baby but unfortunately the past few weeks Ive realized I cannot support a child, I am being kicked out of my parents house, I dont have a great job or support system. Im only 21 and I would love to go to college and enjoy my life a little while I can. I love my partner dearly but he also is young and isnt set in his career or life path. I feel incredibly selfish but I know that I wouldnt feel okay bringing a child into this world in its current state as well as not having enough money, resources. Or being able to stay home and actually bond with them. Id have to go straight back to work and send them with a stranger all day. 

I feel so much grief, I have to constantly distract myself so I dont cry. I feel like such a pos for waiting so long. I have no real support besides my partner but hes also grieving and upset. I go in 4 days. Im so afraid of the procedure. Im scared of the protesters. Im scared of being there all day. I am just so uncertain but I know this is the right decision for me. I just dont know how to reason with myself that Im not a monster, and that I shouldnt cry. 

What do I do with the ultrasound pictures. And the blanket I bought for them.. we already knew the gender and everything. I was so excited but I knew I couldnt keep this up. I hate that I waited so long. I hate that I dragged out this painful process. 

Any advice would truly be appreciated. Im scared beyond belief and Im grieving so hard. I cant imagine what this will make me feel afterwards. Im so afraid but I cant back out. When I think of getting the abortion I feel relieved being able to go back to my life. But Im starting to feel cramps and flutters in my stomach and its killing me. I wish I could just get it done now it feels so bad being dragged out. I need some kind of reassurance that Im doing the right thing. I dont know how to cope.

I had an MA at four weeks towards the end of January and I just wanted to give a little update about my periods since then. 

This subreddit was SO helpful and comforting before, during, and after the abortion so I wanted to contribute some insight. 

I took the mife on 1/25 and the miso on 1/26. 

My first period after started on 3/1 and lasted about six days (normally mine are about three days of actual bleeding). 
My cramps were stronger than normal and came and went for all six days whereas normally its just the first day and the days leading up-to. 
I bled VERY heavily for five days with clots but it all subsided like a normal period after six days. 

I took a pregnancy test on 3/27 for peace of mind that was negative. 

My second period came today 4/5. I didnt have any cramps leading up to it like I normally do but woke up this morning to severe cramping and my period. 

As expected, my cycle has been different with pain, PMS symptoms, and timing.

I had an SA last February. It was illegal in my country, but I'm glad to find safe help.  
  
But, anyway... I've been feeling depressed ever since. I am sad all the time and I cry over the simplest of things. I can't go out because my eyes swells up whenever I see babies and families.. Sometimes I'll find myself staring into space and suddenly cry for no reason at all. It was hard especially during the first two weeks when I was lactating. I'd cry whenever I had to clean myself up because it's a painful reminder of what's not there...  
  
I felt so bad. I feel like such a bad person... like I don't deserve to live because I did not give my baby a chance. Though, don't get me wrong. I'm pro-choice, and I don't think like this at all to whoever had an abortion. These are just the sentiments I had for me, for myself.

It has been really hard. But I know I had to do it because I'm just not ready yet. She will not have the best life with the current version of myself as her mother. I can barely support myself and I had to help out my mother financially as well. Plus, me and my partner are not in the best place, too. He cheated on me two years ago and we have been in a complicated situation ever since. I wouldn't want someone like him to be the father of my child.

However, I can't help but think what could have been...

We were dating during the summer and he promised he wouldnt break up with me when I went back to school in a different state. A month in I became extremely nauseous and couldnt stomach food or breathing without a bottle of tums. When I went to urgent care nobody told me I was pregnant, and I didnt think I was since I thought I had gotten my period. When I got back to my college state, I finally found an urgent care that pronounced me pregnant. When I told him the first thing he said to me was youre aborting it right? and I responded with I guess. The next few mornings were spent with him telling me to hurry up and find a pill because he said I was getting big when I showed him a picture of my stomach. He did pay for the pill, which I guess is great& although deep down I kind of wanted to keep it. He told me if I told anybody in his family I was pregnant he would tell them Im crazy and get them to file a restraining order against me. So the day the pill got delivered to my campus post office he rushed me to go get it and take the pill. While I was entering target to buy diapers and motrin I saw a 3rd trimester pregnant woman and genuinely almost burst into tears. I got back to my dorm and took the two termination pills. He promised me he would be there for me, but since it was family weekend for both of our schools, he decided to instead go to a football game, and tell me to stop talking about it because the people behind him could see his phone. The only support I had was from my roommate. I was contracting from 12-7am and ended up waking up my roommate from the pain I was experiencing. At one point I texted him and told him that I hated him, because I did. I was going through so much with absolutely no support from him. Instead, he blamed me for getting pregnant. As soon as the baby had fully passed, he told me that if I had the baby our lives wouldve changed forever and he wouldve been in the babys life. Soon after, he texted me on Snapchat and told me that Im his baby mama and he owes me a good time at his frat party. It just felt like a slap in the face. I was going through so much and this was just a joke to him. Now present day, Im blocked on everything and just have to deal with this all by myself.

"599",599,"This is going to be kind of long so for those who read it all thank you. My bf (29M) and I (27F) found out 2 weeks ago I was pregnant. The way I found out was by chance too. I went to the doctor for normal follow up on my anxiety medication and they took some blood as normal to make sure things were fine and they always run a pregnancy/HCG test and it unexpectedly came back positive. We were shocked. Weve been together for over three years and while having a child is certainly something we want in the future, it was not something we were planning for just yet. We just bought a house 4 months ago, im the maid of honor in my best friends upcoming wedding in June, his sister is getting married in the fall and we overall just want to be more settled in our home and financially secure. I have been on the same birth control pill for 10 years and never once had a scare or issue. Ive been getting periods everyone month too (minus the month of March) and hadnt had any symptoms or body changes until the last 3 weeks or so but genuinely thought it was a digestive/gastrointestinal issue. 

Looking at my HCG levels my doctor estimated I was 5-8 weeks. After discussing it over many days we decided that terminating was the best thing for us at this point in our lives. We luckily live in a state where options like this are available to us. I went to planned parenthood last week to get the abortion pill which they allow up to 11 weeks. I was adamant about getting a sonogram to see exactly how far I was since this was not something my primary care could do and overall just curious as to how long I have been pregnant and didnt know. As soon as the sonogram started the nurse practitioners face immediately indicated something was wrong. I was much further along than 11 weeks. They estimated 20-22&.I was shocked, devastated, just overwhelmed with emotion. I initially requested to not see the screen but once she realized how far along I was she was saying things like needing to take measurements and trying to find the head,  I asked to see briefly. She turned the screen and I saw it. The spine, the head, while extremely small it was there. This is something I slightly regret.

Since I was so far, obviously I couldnt get the pill and  they only performed suction procedures up to 16 weeks. I was given resources and referrals for if I chose to keep or terminate. After emotional conversations, my boyfriend and I decided not continuing was still best for us and I made an appointment for this upcoming week at a womens care clinic for a second trimester abortion (Dilation and Evacuation). Im absolutely terrified. Not necessarily of having to do it but of what could go wrong. These past 4 1/2 months (prior to finding out) Ive been living life normally; going through the stress of moving, smoking weed, drinking wine every night, occasional cocktails, eating foods not recommended during pregnancies, being in an enclosed space daily with and handling cat litter (my cats litter box is in my home office, I WFH), getting sick and taking not recommended medications. Im scared that will have implications on the procedure. After my experience of trying to get the pill and finding out I couldnt, Im terrified the D&amp;E wont work or theyll be unable to do it. 

Because Im so far along it has to be a two-day endeavor. Day 1 getting dilation medication and the next morning coming back for the procedure.

Like I said before I know absolutely this is whats best for him and I, I just have fears it wont go the way it should.

I had unprotected intercourse one day after my birthday feb15th I was barely 18. That is when my baby was conceived I was bloated and cramping two days after that. I knew in the back of my mind the chances of me not being pregnant were slim. I knew that I was and it made me scared incredibly scared. The father and I were not even in a relationship. The day I took the test I cried by myself in the bathroom because I knew what was coming the judgment, disapproval I'm in my senior year everything came crashing down. The father of the baby had talked me into having it I wasn't sure at first but I decided to. Later that exact same day he asked me ""What if I had got an abortion?"" I responded with it would be ideal. And I thought about it that whole night. My family is not the best my mom is a pro abortionist, and kind of prejudice of dating and marrying outside my race. If she found out if my baby had a white father my baby would have not been treated right.

And I saw how I was so unprepared, scared, and didn't really have anyone to look after me. I wouldn't be able to prepare for that baby, provide for them. I saw the best option was too get the abortion so I decided to get it. I got the pills March 11th took the first one then took the second one's March 12th. I was in so much pain I thought I was losing it.  The pain eased a day later but I was still cramping. Afterward I felt guilty I felt like I was a monster. Like how could I do this to my first child. Right then and their I knew nothing would be the same. I could grow up have a family but the constant thought and reminder of what I had done would always be at the back of my head. Those thoughts raced through my head I would cry I still do but, I would cry and hold the pregnancy test and wish for my baby back.

I knew it was gone forever there was no way to ever get it back. And it made me break even further, I'm not saying I regret what I did many factors played out into my decision. My mom wasn't the best I didn't want my baby growing up in a hostile environment or being mistreated. Just because I felt that way doesn't mean I felt ashamed. I decided that I would live not only for myself but for my baby. I would give them that because they deserved that much if not more.

"629",629,"I just wanted to share my personal experience with abortion as I found reading the experiences of others informative and comforting during a scary and difficult time. 

I found out I was pregnant around a week ago and it was a huge shock. I am in a stable relationship but due to circumstances and timings we were absolutely not ready to become parents, so I immediately got in contact with BPAS as i'm based in the UK. 

I filled out a form online and received a call around an hour after from a very kind lady on the appointment/bookings team. She managed to book a phone consultation for a few days later.

Monday, a midwife called me and we discussed timings of my last period, my current circumstances, the procedure and treatment options. As the timeline was blurry around my last period I was booked in for an ultrasound scan 2 days later to get an accurate read on how far along I was which would determine what kind of treatment I could receive.

The scan appointment went quickly I was told I was 6 weeks and 3 days and was therefore eligible for a medical abortion. This would involve taking a tablet orally (mifepristone- this would block the progesterone hormone/stop the pregnancy), wait 24-48hrs and then inserting x4 different tablets (misoprostol) inside my vagina to induce cramping and expel what was inside.

I took the first tablet Wednesday around 1:30pm and had little to no symptoms until 24hrs later which is when I started experiencing bleeding, mild dizziness and overall feeling of fatigue/weakness. This was manageable still, but I would advise if possible not being too physically active if you can help it/resting where you can as I did feel very drained and lacking energy - have something sugary on hand for here too. I took x4 ibuprufen and x1 antisickness tablet (make sure you take these with food) 30 mins before inserting the x4 tablets as I wanted them to kick in before inducing cramps.

My bleeding gradually got heavier and finally I was in a position where I was able to insert the x4 tablets. I managed to get to sleep and woke perhaps every hour for the first 4 to go to the bathroom and release some blood and tried walking around gently to get things moving. The pain was comparative to a bad period for me and the pain killers and heat pack definitely took the edge off, it was uncomfortable but manageable.

By the time I woke up the pain had subsided a lot but there were still cramps, I had some breakfast and took some more tablets and lay in bed most of the morning resting, getting up when I needed to use the bathroom.

  
Around lunchtime (48 hrs after taking mife/12 hrs after taking the miso) I felt something small plop out of me in the toilet and almost instantly the cramping stopped.

  
I feel lots better, still a little tired and weak (definitely need to take things easy and make sure you're eating plenty) but relieved it's all over and grateful to have the access and the choice to this - as everyone should.

  
Anyone who may be going through something similar, i'd just like to say you are going to be okay, it can feel scary and daunting at times but women are strong and resilient creatures and you'll get through it &lt;3 

Good luck!

Hi everyone,

Last night we (33F and 39M) found out I am 18 weeks pregnant. This went completely unnoticed (I had fake period and zero symptoms until I started wondering why my breasts hurt last week). I have PCOS so hormonal changes and weird cycles are not alarming to me.

I can't get an abortion in my country at this stage, but I have options in Spain or NL. These options consist of ""instrumental abortion"" under sedation. I'm quite terrified of this procedure, especially because I'm overweight and they specify that depending on my BMI, I couldn't be fully sedated. I have no idea how much it would cost either. But this is my only option.

Unless I keep the baby. My boyfriend (been together for 7 years) is more leaning for this option. We are not doing too bad financially because I have a good job, but he doesn't, so it's not like we're super comfortable either. I'm definitely not emotionally ready but he says we'll never be. He says he'll support my decision no matter what, but he just feels so more ready than I am. In my mind I was not considering having a baby before we are landlords and we're barely moving in a slightly bigger rental next month. 
I've also been working a lot this year to better my health, both mental and physical, with finally paying attention to how I eat (I've lost 12kg since January yay) and trying to tackle long-lasting small health issues like my back pain with thorough physiotherapy sessions and exercise. I feel like a pregnancy + childbirth would ruin these efforts. Am I overthinking, trying to find excuses?

Finally, I'm very excited to start a new job in 2 weeks but it requires that I am out of town 2 days and one night each week. This sounds very not aligned with being the mother of a young child. I know boyfriend could take care of the baby while I'm away but would I not be missing something?

I would really appreciate advice in this particular situation, and feedback on the late abortion procedures in Spain or NL. Thank you =O","2025-03-26",1742985212,"Just found out I'm 18 weeks in","Throwaway for privacy reasons.

"640",640,"I just wanted to share my experience because I feel as though its more common that we think.  Also, for context, I am a pro choice catholic who never thought she would have to make this decision.  So if you find yourself in similar shoes, I hope this helps to ease your mind. 

I am 1 year PP in 5 days.  I had a really hard time breastfeeding (you can read about the horrifying MRSA that I dealt with in another post) so I did not return to birth control out of fear that it would kill my supply.  (I have been nursing from one breast since August.) Two weeks ago I conceived on DAY 25 OF 30 of my cycle.  I still cant even believe this happened.  My ovulation must be off from breastfeeding.  Im very regular with my period so I knew immediately like the DAY I missed it. 

As I said, Im 1 year postpartum, which means I have already used all of my sick time at work to have a paid maternity leave (FMLA) and I would have to return to work after 6-12 short weeks of unpaid time.  For context, I am a teacher and summer is free time off. DH and I decided together that this would be a large stressor on our lives and it was important to me (and DH agreed for my mental health) to be able to be there without restriction for our next planned child like I was able to for our first.

I took a test on Monday right after my missed period (negative) but I knew in my heart I am never late.  Took one again Friday, positive.  Went immediately to planned parenthood (IL) that afternoon.  Planned Parenthood couldnt get a positive urine test.  Fully planned on completing MA at that time. But they turned me away after the negative test.  I went home and took 3 more tests which were all positive.  I think this happened because I was drinking water all day and my urine was saturated and theres less HCG in the afternoon. 

Scheduled a SA immediately for Tuesday.  I got to PP and it went quickly because I was one of the first appts of the day (I highly recommend scheduling as early as possible to avoid delay).  They took me back for ultrasound.  They asked me three questions regarding the ultrasound do I want to know gestational age,  do I want to know if its multiples, and do I want a picture.  I said yes to GA and no to multiples and requested not to see the screen or a picture.

They confirmed the pregnancy at 5 weeks and could barely see a sac (which was comforting to me knowing I caught this very early on).  I did  a urine sample which came back positive.  They said I will likely need my blood drawn today and again within 48 hours since they could barely identify the pregnancy just to test HCG levels after procedure.  I had to watch 2 QR code videos regarding the procedure. 

They brought me back for blood pressure and questions.  I chose to be sedated and moderate sedation (twilight sleep) was the only option.  Of course I took it. I went to recovery room where they gave me my ibuprofen 800 + antibiotic.  This was the longest wait for me.  The nurses in recovery were great. 

I was finally called and they brought me to the procedure room where the table was very low to the ground.  They asked my to undress from the waist down, cover with a sheet and put my items in a basket.  I waited some more while texting my support person from my Apple Watch.

The nurse anesthesias came in and asked if I had questions.  I didnt have much because she said I wouldnt be all the way asleep (spoiler I was asleep).  She began my IV and started a nasal cannula. The dr then came in and asked if I had questions and I asked how long the procedure would be.  She told me about 2 minutes.

The nurse pushed versed, ketamine and fentanyl.  Next thing I know Im being sat up and asked to move to a wheel chair.  I asked out loud that was it? And someone answered me that was it! I was super high so I have no idea who answered me. Im wheeled to the recovery room in mesh underwear where I sat to wait off the remaining anesthesia and for 30 minutes of observation. 

The recovery nurses asked my pain and I was in a little bit like 5/10 (abdominals) and they brought me a heating pad which helped greatly.  After 30 minutes they offered me a drink and snack.  I had ginger ale and goldfish.  She said as soon as I was ready and dressed I could go. I was a little nauseous so I waited until that went away before I got up. 

When I was ready, I walked out to my support person who was actually shocked at how short the procedure was and that I was already good to go home.   She said there was never a break in our texting and she couldnt believe how fast it was. 

From my experience, I bought some size 3 &amp; 4 maxi pads and I would have probably been fine with size 2 or 3.  I know everyones experience is different and Im not sure if being early resulted in me bleeding less. 

I got home and took a short nap and laid around.  I had help with my son all day from friends. As Im writing this, Im about 17 hours out from procedure and I have minimal pain and minimal bleeding.  They prescribed ibuprofen 800 and Ive been staying on top of that.  

I had a positive experience at PP and if youre reading this, its going to be ok.  The anticipation is worse than the procedure itself.  I hope this helped ease your mind about a SA experience.  I wanted the quickest recovery so I could spend time with my 1YO on my spring break.

"643",643,"I wanted to come back to share my story, because like many of you I was TERRIFIED when I found out that I was pregnant and was going to get an abortion. It helped me so much to read the positive stories on here and truly got me through one of the hardest points in my life.

So I missed my period, experienced implantation bleeding and found out I was pregnant. I cannot even describe the thoughts and fear that went through my head.. My boyfriend and I JUST broke up prior, I wasn't in the best mental space, I had some minor health issues going, and I knew that this wasn't the right time for a baby.... I really wanted to be a great mom, and I felt like at this moment in time I wouldn't have been able to do so. I hated that I only had two huge choices to make, and it hurt me to, but I had to do what was best.

I also learned I had a subchorionic hematoma a week before my abortion and it caused pretty moderate bleeding which stressed me out more. But the bleeding slowed with rest and I was still able to get my abortion.

Once I decided that I was going to have an abortion I chose the SA route because of the pill horror stories (I know everyone is different) but I have a low pain tolerance and I was scared. I then learned that sedation was an option, so I went with that in order to make the procedure less traumatizing.

DAY OF PROCEDURE: (\~6 weeks pregnant) I opted for moderate sedation (fentanyl and versed) and I couldn't eat or drink anything the night before. My anxiety was through the roof, I suffer from severe anxiety and some depression and I was shook not knowing what to expect. Nevertheless, I went to planned parenthood and I had a good experience. The staff were kind and caring, and the doctor that did the procedure was great! The sedation nurse was also awesome.

Before the actual procedure you get an ultrasound, go through some counseling and consent, and take some meds.

Once I went in for the procedure I was so terrified I was panicking and my heart rate was through the roof! They had to delay starting until my heart rate went down. I've never had sedation or been put to sleep before so I was soooo scared, but the staff were so patient and kind. Next thing I know the sedation went into my IV, the ceiling looked weird lol, and I was knocked OUT. I then wake up which felt like a minute later in the recovery room and I was asked to check my pad for bleeding and offered snacks. I was definitely out of it for a while, but I remembered NOTHING from the procedure! No pain, nothing, only light cramping and bleeding after. My procedure was also complicated according to the doctor because they had trouble dilating my cervix and I have a possible bicornuate uterus which elongated the procedure, but thankfully it was completed and I still didn't feel a thing!

After the sedation began to wear off my ex picked me up and I rested for the day and the drugs completely wore off.... If you have severe anxiety or are worried about pain I highly suggest an SA with sedation! It wasn't as bad as I thought at all!

Overall, I'm happy the procedure was successful and the procedure wasn't as terrible as I thought. However, the time leading up to and waiting was the worst! Also the recovery period for me (mentally) has been rough. It's been about 18 days for me since my procedure and my moods have been up and down, definitely dealing with some postpartum guilt and depression but I'm working through it!","2025-03-25",1742942377,"SA with sedation experience at PP.

"648",648,"I never wanted a baby.

This is a mindset that I stand firmly by. I knew I didnt want a baby from the start.

To experience the body changes, the labor, the birthing itself, it doesnt spark any interest for me.

I was very vocal about it. I told my mom, my friends, and even my partner.

I have always been lucky, never getting pregnant without birth control or even condoms. I assumed I was that lucky. I was confidentand I took that for granted.

I am used to having late periods because sometimes my period is a month late. This time around, I was confident that it was like the befores.

Until it became 2 months late&

I shrugged it off but asked my partner to buy me a pregnancy test.

It came back positive.

I laughed, thinking, This must be a joke.

I took another one the next morning, still two lines.

I was in denial. I didnt want to accept it.

I wanted to confirm if it was true, so I scheduled an OB appointment. But I kept on pushing and pushing it until it became 3 weeks later.

I went to that OB appointment, had an ultrasound, and there it was... the baby... I could see its form. It already had hands& like it was waving at me.

In that moment, I wasHAPPY.

I was smiling the whole time. I felt like a proud MOM.

I knew I wasnt ready, but I was happy in that moment.

After that, my partner and I had a talk.

Do we keep it?

CAN we handle the responsibility?

&No.

We are at the peak of our careers, having the best times, and still figuring out our relationship. We have already been together for 5 years, not married, still young  but this idea is something we are not planning for, nor hoping for.

We decided to not keep it. We are both not ready, and we dont want to bring a baby in this world with uncertainty.

Deep down, I know I dont want to have a baby at this age. I have dreams, I have opportunities that would be put to waste if I kept the baby.

During our weeks of figuring out what to do, I loved the feeling of being pregnant. Knowing theres a little one inside me, eating what I am eating, feeling what I am feeling... I was loving it.

I kept on unconsciously always caressing my tummy, always holding my tummy, sleeping with my hands on my tummy... I loved my baby.

But I know that if I kept it, I was afraid Id regret it. Or only keep it because of guilt or pity.

Until we came across a post that sold abortion pills, and we decided to take the risk.

When I got the meds, I was advised to prepare. Drink this, eat that, do this, do thatfor the baby to have a weak hold.

I felt really guilty, but I had to do it...

We had a conversation again, I opened up that I dont feel good about doing this. And so he asked be if I wanted to keep it, because he will support me either way.

I felt really sad whenever my partner would hold my tummy, call me mommy, care for me because I am pregnant. I knew he was going to be a good father.

I really wanted to keep our baby. but I am so scared. Im not ready to be a parent. What if I couldnt give what  the baby deserves?

So I decided to stick to the plan.

The day came... the day I decided to take the pill.

I was prepared... I was ready.

I took the pill. It was painful.

I experienced heavy cramping, nausea, and chills.

After a few hoursI experienced labor.

Oh god, the contractions? PAINFUL.

I didnt know what to do. I was swirling around the bed and the room, regretting the decision because of the pain. I thought the pills had failed because it had been more than 10 hours, but there was no bleeding at all.

Until after lots of very painful contractions, I decided to go to the bathroom to pee... and I felt the urge to push.

And so I did.

I could already feel it, pushing down, and I felt the head. So I pushed harder.

The baby fell to the floor. With a loud sound of a slap.

I was stunned. I didnt know what to do.
The baby was still inside the sac, connected to the placenta.

I stared at it. For 5 minutes. Panicking.

I didnt know if I should hold it or pick it up. I was afraid I would cause more damage to the babys fragile body.

At one moment, I saw it move. Like a spasm... or the last movement of a muscle.

I decided to pop the sac so I could see the baby clearly.

I moved the legs gently... Its a girl.

Oh god... shes my baby. My first baby... a girl.

I cried, not knowing what to feel. I kept on saying sorry... and caressing her.

Saying sorry to my baby when I am the one who did this to her.

I prayed with her. I prayed for her journey to heaven.

And I promised her that I will have a baby again when Im finally ready. 

I will make it right, the next time.. and I know its not going to be you.. I took the life you were supposed to have.. but I know youll understand.. I will always remember you..

It has been days, and Ive been crying every time I remember her. I look at her pictures on my phone every time and cry. I cry every time I am alone.

And I regret not even holding her. I regret not spending more minutes to be with her. Because I was afraid, and because I was guilty seeing her that way.

I feel so sad. If I were only brave enough to keep her. If it had just been perfect timing...

I love my baby, my first baby.

And Im not proud of what I did, but this is a decision I did not take lightly. I tried to think of ways to make it work, to just keep her. But there are more reasons not to.

To my baby girl, Im so sorry. Mommy loved you, for those weeks that I knew I was your mom. And I will forever LOVE you and REMEMBER you until I die.

I'm 30 years old, and last Monday, I found out I was pregnant. It came as a huge shock, especially since its my first pregnancy and Im not married yet. The first thing I did was tell my boyfriend, and he was just as shocked. The hardest part was not having a big friend circle to turn to for advice, so I panicked and felt a lot of anxiety, especially with the thought of how my mom would react. I eventually shared the news with my best friend, and her sister-in-law, who is a doctor, really scared me with her concerns about the pregnancy, including the possibility of it being ectopic. That added more to my fear, and I thought there was no way Id be able to go through with an abortion.

The only reassuring thing she said was that I should get an ultrasound. I took the rest of the day off work and went with my boyfriend. The ultrasound showed that I was 6 weeks and 6 days along. In that moment, I felt so many emotionsit was overwhelming. I saw my boyfriends face, and I could feel his happiness and his emotions, but I had to keep myself composed because I knew, for many reasons, that I couldnt keep the pregnancy.

When I got home, I told the lady doctor, and she advised me to see a gynecologist. She made me think that abortion might not be legal and that the doctor wouldnt help, but still encouraged me to try. At that point, I had so many questions and was feeling lost. However, coming across this page and reading others' experiences really helped me. Seeing how others handled similar situations gave me the strength to make my decision.

So, I saw the gynecologist, who suggested doing an HCG blood test, and then another one in three days. At the time, I felt like it was just a delay, but I think it also gave me a chance to think more clearly and figure out how I would proceed if I had to do this on my own. The best part was the support from my best friend and boyfriendthey couldnt be with me physically, but they checked in on me and kept offering their encouragement.


Over the past three days, I consulted with a pharmacist who explained the use of mifepristone and misoprostol, and my boyfriend and I did thorough research to prepare ourselves. On Friday, I had another HCG test, and it showed the levels were still growing, confirming I was now 7 weeks and 4 days pregnant.

That evening, I decided to take the step and took mifepristone. Now, 48 hours later, I took the misoprostol as directed. The first 3-4 hours were incredibly tough, with intense cramps that made me feel like I wouldnt make it through. I used heat pads and found that I couldnt sit still, so I kept walking, which helped ease the pain. After about 4 hours, something like a 3-inch piece came out, which really scared me, but after that, the pain started to subside. Now, the bleeding continues, and Im laying on a heat pad, feeling a few clots pass.

Im hopeful everything will go as well, and Id love to hear your thoughts. Thank you all for your support!","2025-03-23",1742754797,"My experience","

A few hours later my cramps got worse, I felt heavy bleeding, and a large blood clot. When I got home I went downstairs to change and noticed blood gushing out to the point where it was dripping to my ankles. That was when I looked at my underwear and saw a large blood clot that was a little bigger than a quarter with white deformed looking things in it. I dont know if this could be because I havent gotten my period in a while and Im shedding tissue or because Ive had a possible miscarriage.

Yesterday at around 2:30pm I started feeling crampy and had light bleeding so I thought I was getting my normal period back. By 8:30pm it had been pretty light so all I had on was a panty liner. A few hours later my cramps got worse, I felt heavy bleeding, and a large blood clot. When I got home I went downstairs to change and noticed blood gushing out to the point where it was dripping to my ankles. That was when I looked at my underwear and saw a large blood clot that was a little bigger than a quarter with white deformed looking things in it. I dont know if this could be because I havent gotten my period in a while and Im shedding tissue or because Ive had a possible miscarriage. I did take pregnancy tests a few days ago that were negative. So Im really not sure. Any advice would help. Thanks :)","abortion",2,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1ji1f94/i_got_an_abortion_in_december_and_i_think_either/"

Tired of the cramping everytime after I do light exercise or have sex or drink cold water. The next day I will be having light cramps no bleeding but the whole day. Its not extremely painful but Im just tired of it. I read its normal for up to 6 weeks.

Also not being able to predict when my period is coming post abortion is giving me alot of stress and fucking with my head. Im also scared that its going to be very painful - since my normal periods before abortion are already debilitating.

"658",658,"CO, USA. I never expected to fall pregnant, but yk I did what I had to do and went to plan parenthood for everything I need for an abortion. The doc prescribed zofran, 800 mg ibuprofen, and the 4 pills to induce the abortion. Im scared. Will I be okay? I dont usually take medications. Ive never had this much ibuprofen before, Ive never had zofran. And Im scared of the bleeding. Whats to expect? I already get bad periods, but I dont need more than 600mg usually. 

Just paranoid.

Update 2 (update 1 is in comments): it's roughly 2 and a half hours after taking the misoprostol or whatever. I've been bleeding for sure, slightly light headed but that could be from this whole process, the zofran, my panic attack pills, or all of it!
The pain truly has not been as bad as I expected, but I did also take the 800mg preemptively because I was scared of bad pain. I experienced back pain pre the massive clots. (at least I think theres been massive clots, I haven't been watching cuz im scared lol)
Right now I'm just making sure I'm not bleeding too much. Which I don't think I am. Things feel pretty okay. But I am still checking every hour. If this hour my pad is also soaked, I will be calling the nurse on duty.

I am not experiencing any nausea (I bailed out on the zofran as well, I didn't like the taste), I feel like my normal self roughly. This isn't going as bad as I was expecting.

Update 3:

Its been a few hours or so probably. According to on call nurse my bleeding has been normal. I still havent had any unbearable pain, Ive had worse with a normal period. Ive started passing clots (it was for sure previously just blood) That was definitely spooky for me personally. The lightheadedness subsided. Things arent too bad.

"659",659,"12:30 So I've followed all of the directions so far. Took ibuprofen and the nausea medicine at 10:30 and my first dose of miso at 11. The cramping didn't start until about an hour after inserting the miso, half an hour after swallowing.

The cramping started and just kept getting worse and worse until it was unbearable. I had to poop, but it was very soft and messy. Pushing seemed to help the pressure a little, though.

Eventually I went to lie down and it started to hurt worse. I noticed if I was standing it didn't hurt as bad as laying or sitting, but I was so tired and trying to fall asleep.

Eventually I got up and went back to the bathroom. I used a box to prop up my feet and squat on the toilet. I definitely recommend this. After a few minutes everything came out all at once. There was a lot of blood, I had to even push some out. It just felt kind of like peeing.

It wasnt really something I necessarily wanted someone to experience with me but in hindsight I do wish I had someone as emotionally I feel okay, but having someone rub my stomach or some reassurance would of been 100% helpful. I did have a loved one  checking in on me through the phone which was nice but actually using my phone was not high on my priority tbh so I only responded after the worst pain was over. If youve going into this alone just make sure to keep ur phone charged and at the very least schedule a call a couple hours after taking miso so if theres an emergency and u cant call for help theyll know something is up. 

9:20-9:30 19/03 - took mifepristone. I didnt notice any changes other than some slight cramping nothing unbearable I had trouble sleeping that night 

20/01- no changes, doctor wanted me to get blood drawn so in 5 days could get bloods again to see if MA successful. No spotting. I was very emotional that day and cried pretty much the whole day and at pathologist though. 

6:30-6:40am 21/03 - woke up and noticed spotting. I had some food for breakfast as knew I was going to take misoprostone. I just had toast and water.

9:30am 21/03 - doctor recommended taking anti nausea and Panadol before taking second pills so I did that and had a shower in preparation 

10:20 - tbh was stalling taking second pill as I was scared but ending up taking. Nothing to note they dont really have a taste I took these orally. 

11:30 - cramps ramped up from 2/10 prior day to honestly probably 9/10 they didnt last more than 20 minutes. However it felt like forever and I would go from sitting on the toilet to bathroom floor to try and get comfortable. Use a heat pack it honestly helped cramps a lot more for me than any pain killers for my discomfort. 

11:45- went from toilet to bed and tried to get some sleep. 

12:40 - went to toilet again and had really bad cramps I then had diarrhoea pretty bad and sat on toilet floor for about 20 minutes after sitting on toilet for 20 minutes then went back to room.

3:40pm - at this point cramps a lot less painful. However still passing blood. Pain is 7/10 I had some grapes, water and Oreos as a snack. 

5:57pm - cramps are dull I havent taken another Panadol as it is bearable. Pain 2/10. Im still bleeding but its lighter. 

9:00 - finished having dinner and feel pretty normal, still cramping but its 1/10. I had a shower too which made me feel a lot better. I am still bleeding but its normal for probably the next 2-6 weeks. I hoping it dosent go on the max though. 

Final verdict 

- until I get result from next blood test Im not sure how things went in terms of if successful
- Definitely use heat packs and good ones. I felt more comfort from them then pain killers when pain was the worst it was 
- Anti nausea helped me immensely I did feel nausea from smells and cramps but was able to keep everything down 
- In terms of blood I definitely did not fill up 2 pads in an hour at any point. Nor did I pass particularly large clots I was only 6 weeks however. I think the largest it got was 50 cent pieces. 
- The pain was really bad but gradually lessened I did  plan to keep the embryo or dispose of it in a nicer way than the toilet like burial with loved ones but honestly there was so much coming out of me when I was using the toilet unfortunately I dont know when it wouldve passed. 
- I generally have rough periods but this was worse. I would say taking stronger pain killers would have helped ( got prescribed paracetamol w codeine) but I really didnt want to pass out and wake up in a mess if I have an accident while sleeping so I used normal Panadol. 
- I have anxiety and I didnt have chills but my heart was racing; breathing exercises helped so much in calming me down as well as trying to keep a comfortable environment in my room - scented candles, food on hand etc. 
- I didnt have the stomach for liquid so definitely try and have electrolytes and as much water as possible before taking second pill. 
Overall I would say my experience was positive but I never want to do this again. Its emotionally more of a toll the week leading up to this. All of the doctors, ultra sound technicians and even pathologists I saw were lovely and treated me with care which I appreciated. I do want kids later in life but this was a surprise and Im not in a good place financially. I will be getting an IUD as soon as I can regardless of whether I continue to be sexually active.

"667",667,"Hi all, this is a throw away account.

So basically I found out I was pregnant, last week 03/14, I had been having some sharp breast pain and nipple pain especially but I just brushed it off to PMS. Come Friday I took a PT, the dollar tree ones were a bit faint but the digital one wrapped it up. I alr knew I wasn't keeping it but I was still scared because I still live under my parents roof and they cannot find out. So I decided to go the pill route.
My partner ordered some pills from aid access the day we found out and the paying process was quick but we did not get any shipping info. So I decided to order from THE MAP/CRHC and they are due to arrive tmr. So I just want to document my journey on here as I have been doom scrolling through other stories and my biggest worry is an unsuccessful MA process. Will update when pills get here. But pls any advice is welcome.

1:58: took first pill mife. Felt a lil bit of cramping but so far so good just chilling rn.

2:00- too first does of miso buccally. Held it in mouth for 30 mins. Cramps started immediately, these may be the worst kinda cramps Ive ever felt and its kinda spreading down my right leg.

4:44- feel the need to use the restroom, I see that I started bleeding. After all was said and done I looked and seen that I passed the gestational sac along with little clots. It was kind of a like a small white round thing, translucent, partially filled with air. 

6:30- pain has subsided a lot, just drank some sweet tea 

8:25- took second round of miso. Honestly I was most scared to take this round because of what I experienced after the first hit here we are >r

8:55- swallowed miso. Concerned I took it two hours late so I called MA hotline. They said it was fine and asked if I had cramping or bleeding already, which I did.

9:15- thankfully not the same cramping as the first round, but I do feel some major bloating like my stomach is being filled with air =-. I dont know if thats normal.

10:05, just intense bloating rn. Had a little cramping and passed some more blood but the bloating is NOT letting up and its not getting passed anyhow =

03/22 1:56- woke up to a call from partner. Stomach was still bloated. Felt the need to =, oh you guessed it, had diarrhea ="".

8:30- woke up, went to pee, I didnt really have much bleeding at all, but I wore after and there were some clots and one clot the size of a pea with a white line on it.

10:00- had some more diarrhea =-

I started really bleeding today and passing some more clots, this is pretty similar to my period bleeding, but im not necessarily filling up pads but just bleeding a regular amount I believe. Cramps have subsided and they only really come when Im about to bleed again.

Bled for a whole week and passed a few clots. Minimal to zero pain the whole week. Has protected sex like twice (I know I shouldve waited).

So basically I found out I was pregnant, last week 03/14, I had been having some sharp breast pain and nipple pain especially but I just brushed it off to PMS. Come Friday I took a PT, the dollar tree ones were a bit faint but the digital one wrapped it up. I alr knew I wasn't keeping it but I was still scared because I still live under my parents roof and they cannot find out. So I decided to go the pill route.
My partner ordered some pills from aid access the day we found out and the paying process was quick but we did not get any shipping info. So I decided to order from THE MAP/CRHC and they are due to arrive tmr. So I just want to document my journey on here as I have been doom scrolling through other stories and my biggest worry is an unsuccessful MA process. Will update when pills get here. But pls any advice is welcome.

"677",677,"Hi all, 

I am finally home laying in bed after a 15 week surgical abortion from planned parenthood. It has been a LONG road to get here. I used plan B after having unprotected sex, then attempted to have a medical abortion when the fetus was roughly 4 weeks, which failed. I just wanted to let everyone know that if you are considering going there for a SA, DO IT. They were all so incredibly nice to me and went above and beyond in order to make me feel comfortable. The only 2 parts that freaked me out were getting the iv (since I opted for moderate sedation) and thats only because I hate needles. The nurse was super nice about it and even wrapped my arm up so it was out of sight. I then had to sit for about 2 hours to let the meds dissolve in my cheek to loosen up my cervix. For the procedure itself, I had the doctor, a sedation nurse, 2 helper nurses (Im sorry if I butchered their job title =-), and a very lovely volunteer woman who was there to hold my hand and make me feel at ease. Now, I received my moderate sedation right before the procedure began so I apologize if my memory of everything isnt the greatest. The first part was the doctor inserting the speculum into my vagina and dilating my cervix, which was honestly the only part that felt uncomfortable, like a 6/10 pain and it only lasted a brief time. They had me cough for each numbing injection to my cervix which apparently distracts your mind away from the pain - which totally worked, I barely felt a thing from each shot. The procedure itself honestly barely felt like anything, just some pressure here and there. I had the volunteer holding my hand and Im pretty sure I was talking about different foods with the other nurses, lol. After that, I was transferred back to the recovery room to get my IV taken out, then I waited a little in the lobby before leaving to call an uber. I had the best nap of my LIFE as soon as I got home and when I woke up the remaining dizziness was gone. I am currently using nighttime pads to catch all of the bleeding and am on extra strength ibuprofen for the cramping.

my boyfriend and i decided to take the mife yesterday and the miso today. i was on reddit reading everybodys experiences and honestly i was so scared and prepared for pretty much anything. i had advil, tylenol, nausea meds, gatorade, water, huge cotton pads, heat pad, my boyfriend. everything i might need. 

we started the process at 8:30am. i took 4 advils and a nausea pill at 8am. lowkey had to puke bc my breakfast didnt sit right with me. i got in bed. put the 4 pills under my tongue. like 10 mins in i started feeling the cramps and my boyfriend was next to me as the cramps started to increase. 9am i swallowed the residue with water. the pills made my tongue and throat sore. i also started shaking like a lot. i was shaking for 30 mins and it made the cramps worse. my body was cold. one thing i didnt pack was socks but thankfully my boyfriend gave me his. i needed to poop right away. i did expect diarrhea as it is one of the symptoms but i thought it was kinda early. anyway i went to the bathroom, the cramps were getting worse, i started bleeding too. the cramps def hit peak but it was like oscillating. like it would hurt so much and go back to normal like every 2 secs. im assuming thats the contractions. the first big clot came out at around 9:30am i believe and i sorta cuddled up in bed with a heating pad and fell asleep. i woke up at around 10:30 and i wasnt feeling any pain but out of nowhere the cramps hit me bad again. i think it was bc i moved around. i needed to poop again and i was in a lot of pain until another blood clot came out and the cramps went away. after that at around 11:15am i took a couple tylenols. at 11:30am i took the second set of pills. i started shaking again like 20 mins in. needed to poop again, a big clot came out instead. i was fine for the rest of it except for mild cramps, heavy bleeding, and diarrhea. i slept thru a lot of it and at 2:15pm i took 2 advils and nausea pill. took my last set at 2:30pm and i shook again=-. mild cramps, heavy bleeding, and diarrhea. and thats pretty much it. we napped for the rest of the time. im not sure if its just me but i cant seem to eat solid food without puking. but other than that, it wasnt as bad as i was expecting. hope this helps :)

I guess when deciding to have an abortion I never thought about my reactions/triggers to my other close friends reveling their pregnancy to us. It was hard. And a lot of emotions resurfaced, considering I would have been due soon if I were to have kept it. I selfishly was not happy for them, but sad. sad, regretful, and envious that they were able to announce this to us, and thought of what could have been if we choose to keep it instead. I fear I will be emotional at their gender reveal / baby shower. (I haven't told any one about the abortion and we've kept it just between us)

I went to the woman's clinic on Bloor Street in Toronto and they were absolutely caring and helpful. 
I called a week prior to make an appointment but they do take same day appointments as well. 
I got there and they asked for my healthcard and I filled out a few forms . It was super busy so I was in the waiting room for one hour which I didn't mind . I got called into see the counselor, they make sure this is what you want and that no one else is forcing you, very comforting and answer any questions you may have . She gave me a lorazepam to help with my anxiety which instantly helped . Next I had to pee in a cup then was sent to change into a night gown and was given a bag for my clothes and belongings. I waited in that waiting room for about 10 min then was called in for the procedure. They give you iv pain meds as well as sedation . I didn't feel anything and it only lasted 2 min. You feel really high and loopy when they send you to the recovery room . They watch you for half an hour and make sure you aren't bleeding alot (which is really really rare like 2% chance, I only had a spot of blood) they give you Tylenol for cramps but I didn't have cramps . They also give you cookies and gingerale to settle your stomach after the sedation medication . I threw up a bit but was completely fine after . All the staff are nice, caring and understanding. This procedure is nothing to be scared about as they say this is safer than actual childbirth ... Comparable to going to the dentist . I promise you will be okay d it's just fear of the unknown, you will feel so much relief the second they say you are no longer pregnant . Feel free to ask me any questions .

Examples including, always be ready to be a single mom no matter what because anything can happen, youll be stuck with that person for life and yes they can be a good dad they cannot be a good parent, how they treat you while pregnant and postpartum tells you how they will treat you your entire life, I love my child but I tried to see if I can abort at 5 months but it was too late for me in the state, youll never regret your child but youll regret being there in your life, they miss their parents, you would rather regret an abortion than a child, a child is easy and dont require much but parenthood without a good support system is hard. You cant always depend on said support system, at the end of the day its just you even if your partner says you can depend on them. They listed more deeper reasons than dirty diapers. Told partner that I kinda wish I can keep it but timing isnt right. He says he agrees but he would try to get a better paying job if I wanted to keep it. Then I asked does he see a future with me like if we ever get married, he dances around the question, then I asked if we could get eloped today would he do it? After a minute he goes no. I say oh okay. He then says its not that youre not worth investing a future with but its just a lot of big commitments in a short time. Theres my answer. Later he gets mad I told my boss that I needed two weeks off for it, I told him why i told my boss the truth, he says I am making excuses for why I told my boss and 1 singular coworker that I trust.
Wednesday: I am crying. Idk why. I knew this is what I wanted to do but I wanted to do it quickly so I wouldnt get attached. Ive been coping and making some light jokes by calling it a parasite. Later I called my bf because I was feeling down, i asked him more questions for our future to get some reassurance ill be okay, he mentioned his mom was visiting so he could help set up her new phone. I asked him can he do it later or drop her off at home as soon as he is done, he got mildly irritated. I told him I feel like I am entitled to an apology due to his response of not really being there and lecturing me because I told my boss. He stagger to cuss me out and I hung up. He proceeded to say he shouldve left me since the beginning of our relationship and I am putting too much blame on him. I just ignored him for the rest of the day. I tried to get something to eat before the pills come in but I had to turn around while driving because I was crying too hard. Asked my bf if he could drop me off some food and snacks before the pills come in. I told him im crying too hard and if not I can ask our mutual friend at the time if she can do it. He said he cannot drop anything off today but possibly tomorrow due to him helping his mom set up her new phone. He informs me he got the pills delivered to his house so I asked him to drop it off because it is the least he can do. He gets mad at me again and then later asks what did I need from the store. He drops off the pills, heating pad, and snacks. 
We dont talk for the rest of the day until I take the starter pill. I hang up because I dont feel like making an argument for myself. 
Thursday: we havent talked and finally I took the first round of pills at Friday 1am. 

Friday: I fall asleep for 30 minutes and then woke up from the pain. After withering in pain for four hours it was time for the second dose and tmi but after passing it i had diarrhea and vomiting at the same time. I called my bf because I was scared again and then I hung up from the pain. I was now suffering from dizziness, couldnt keep anything in, pain was awful I slept in the hot shower 3 times until 9am or sat on the toilet with my heating bad. I have a low pain tolerance and I hit my limit of ibuprofen. Call the hotline and the lady gave me an attitude for a quick second because I asked if Liquid IV would help my recovery a little and then proceeded to try to encourage and give me advice. I call my bf again and I felt relieved my cramps were manageable because I started to take midol and 800mg of ibuprofen. We didnt argue and we make up by joking around. Later around nightmare I am emotional about it all after putting a brave front. I told my friends I feel like he made it more traumatic than it already was. 
I have been crying for the last 9 hours on the phone with my bf as he apologizes. I feel like I am grieving my little bean that I couldnt raise in a perfect world because the odds were against us, Im grieving my relationship, and my identity. I went from not wanting to be a mother to making a painful decision that I dont regret out of love within 4 days. I am numb when Im not crying. I know itll be easier in the future but I do not think I will be okay or have the same laughter or light in my eyes I had before Monday. I dont regret it but I am rather sadden by everything. My relationship with my bf had love, care, and respect in it with us talking about marriage and children and I couldve always depended on him and now I feel cornered, isolated, devastated, and scared because he gave me an exclusive sneak peak for if we had a future. I thought I mattered more than an iphone. I want my little bean in a perfect world with a loving and stable home. I didnt want them to experience the childhood I experienced and what I am experiencing right now. My bf has apologized since last night (friday) (it is now saturday) and has stayed on the phone while I cry while asking if I am okay but I am checking out and leaving in a month or when I am ready. Food has no taste, I have no appetite, colors are so bland, music is so irritating, and I want to raise my little bean with my old self. I dont think I will ever be okay or my normal self ever again. I worked hard to be where I was at mentally and now I feel like I am at my lowest. I hate talking about the future because I dont see one. My boyfriend made this more traumatic than what it already was physically and mentally. I dont think he takes me seriously and never will and I really thought I could depend on him during this time. I cant depend on him and myself anymore. I want my little bean and I want the dirty diapers and the back talk but I dont regret my decision. Im sorry that this is long. I will be seeing a therapist soon but I want to rot out before I do. Yes I am medicated for bipolar 1 and anxiety from school. 
I am sorry if my post is confusing. I have friends I am talking to and ones who went through the same thing but I cannot cope. I am shutting down. I am starting to resent my partner and I wish he was ready to provide in a heartbeat.

Hello everyone!! First I want to say thank you for taking your time out to read what I am going through and giving me advice on this topic
* we listen and we dont judge lol*
I, 22(F) have recently found out I was 7 weeks pregnant. When first finding out, My boyfriend of 3 years (27M) initial response and reaction were very supportive. However, as the weeks have went by he has told me reality kicked in for him and he is not ready to be a dad at this point in life. In October of 2024, I miscarried a pregnancy with me only knowing I was pregnant for 1 day and it crushed my soul and spirit. I was not looking to have a baby at the moment and neither was my boyfriend, however it was a very emotional situation for me. There was a point in my life that I thought I would never be able to conceive kids as easily due to me having PCOS, I opened up to my boyfriend about these concerns. It is really heart breaking that he wants me to abort my baby due to his  reality . I currently have two jobs, work Monday through Friday from 8-6pm. My main job is 30$ an hour while my second is 25$ hourly. With the correct budgeting and planning and the support of our village I feel in my spirit and heart that this will work, however he feels opposite. He has asked me everyday to rethink my decision because ultimately I told him I was not getting the abortion. We did nothing to prevent this and he was still ejaculating inside of me, even after the miscarriage. I am aware that we were being irresponsible, however this is what happens when you are not preventing pregnancy the proper way. I do not want to get the abortion but feel pretty dumb for keeping a baby my partner does not want, he made it known that he will be here for our child but he doesnt really want anything to do with me as his girlfriend because I am not  understanding . Any advice on how I should go about this? Or if you were in this situation, how did this play out for you? Everyone in my family is on board, including his mom. I really wanted a two parent household and Im almost sure that that wont happen. I am pretty devastated and feel very selfish&but I just cant get the abortion I love my little fetus so much already&.idk what to do.","abortion",8,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jgnjdj/do_not_want_abortion/"

After having an abortion at 18 I told myself Id never do it again so when I fell pregnant at 34, fully able to care for and support a child I didnt even consider it an option. 

My partner and I had only been back together for a short while (after 3 year hiatus due to not wanting to do long distance) but we both knew getting back together meant we were serious this time. Our relationship has always been wonderful, and loving but I was still unsure how he would react to a pregnancy. I knew he wanted kids eventually but we were not in the best position time wise given I was still in the process of figuring out how to move. Still, I really thought he was going to want to proceed with the pregnancy. 

When I told him about the pregnancy I was about 9 weeks along. I asked him how he felt and what he wanted to do- I wanted to get his honest reaction before providing my thoughts. He said he wasnt ready to be a father and said we should terminate. I cried and cried and told him I didnt think I could do that so he said he didnt feel ready or capable but if thats my choice then well proceed with the pregnancy. I could tell thats not what he wanted and I did not want to force fatherhood on someone. I wanted someone to be excited and joyful about it. I went back and forth on my decision trying to balance what I wanted versus the life we would have. I loved him, more than my own wishes, so I ultimately decided to terminate. 

Fast forward and its been 10 months. We have talked so much about this, I have been to 2 different types of specialized therapy and nothing is helping the guilt and regret. He says seeing me in so much pain still and seeing how stable we are now since the move he regrets his initial reaction, wishes we kept it, and blames himself. I dont in my right mind blame him because it was ultimately my decision but my resentment has somehow grown towards him and I dont know what to do to stop it. 

I watch him go to work, work towards his promotion, save up for the things he wants to get, plan for his buddies bachelor party trip and I get angry inside like how are you just going on about your life and the only thing I want I will never get back? I get angry he never brings the baby up when its all I think about. And I know Its irrational because why would he bring it up? He had no connection to it, I did. And I know my feelings are misplaced but I have no idea what to do and Im worried Im going to grow to resent him so much that Im going to have to leave. I blame myself for the decision but somewhere deep inside I blame him more, because I wanted him to want this and I dont understand his mindset of wanting to terminate even though I know he has a right to his own feelings. So yes, Irrational, again I know, but I feel it. 

Has anyone dealt with resentment towards a partner for their feelings about a pregnancy even if they have been supportive and loving post-abortion? What do you do? How do you cope? Im losing grip on things. ","abortion",8,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jelpw2/partner_resentment_help_i_dont_what_to_do/"
"704",704,"My MA experience - positive - Bpas uk","2025-03-18",1742298212,"My MA experience - positive - Bpas uk","I wanted to write this post as I really worked myself up prior to taking the treatment based on other things Id read. 
I felt the overwhelming need to share my experience in the hope that it will help others, especially those in England, UK. 

I found out about my pregnancy on 3/3 - I didnt really know how I felt about it. I already have a 4 year old son, who has recently had an autism diagnosis, hes my absolute world and I was excited at the thought of him having a sibling but in the same breath he has very high care needs and hes my priority. The timing just wasnt right and I decided I couldnt continue with the pregnancy. 

After giving myself a few days to be sure on my decision, I filled out the online form with BPAS on 7/3 and received an email back the same day with a telephone appointment for 11/3. 
I just had to get through the weekend and wait for the phone call. 
The lady on the phone was really polite and non judgmental. She went through a series of questions to determine gestation etc and then she gave me two options, Medical or Surgical. 
If Im being honest, the medical option scared me from what Id read online so I was swaying toward the surgical option and just getting it over with. 
The issue I had was that there was a wait for the surgical route, whereas they could have sent the medical treatment out to me ASAP. 
She said I was still very early (5w 1d when I called) and although they can do a surgical procedure, there is a risk when the pregnancy is so small that they might miss something, she recommended me coming in for a surgical procedure closer to 8 weeks. - this was just the information I was given, whether this is factually correct or not, I dont know. 
Regardless of gestation, there was a couple week wait for the surgical procedure anyway as they prioritised emergencies and those with later gestations. 
I didnt like the thought of waiting for a couple of weeks when Id already made my decision, I just wanted it over. I chose the medical route despite my nervousness and she said thats absolutely fine, she explained the process and risks, and said the medications would be sent out by Royal Mail tracked 24 and would be with me in 1-2 days. 
The box came through the letterbox on 13/3, two days after the call. The great thing about the medication is that it comes in a discreet postable box so you dont have to worry if youre not home as its just put straight through your door. 

The box contained the Medabon box (1x mifepristone, 4x misoprositol) 
2x extra misoprositol and a pregnancy test. 

Knowing step one of the treatment doesnt tend to have bad side effects, I took step one of the treatment, the single mifepristone tablet on the Friday 14/3 at 3pm. 
I didnt have any issues with this apart from very very gentle period type pains later that evening, and some slight pink on the toilet roll when I wiped, nothing else. I managed to sleep fine and felt well overall. 

You have to take step two within 24-48 hours of taking step one. So Id recommend timing it so youre taking step 2 (misoprositol) at a time where you can be comfortable, at home or somewhere safe, and some support off another person if possible. 

Make sure youre prepared before step two - Even though I personally didnt end up needing much, it was nice to know I was prepared for every eventuality!
I put a towel on the bed, got into comfy clothes, put a bowl at the side of the bed in case I was sick, water, snacks etc and the most important thing was taking the pain relief. 
The provider I used, BPAS, recommended taking 4x ibuprofen (800mg) half an hour before you take the misoprositol - this is what I did at 2:30pm, I recommend the liquid ibuprofen capsules if you can have them, exactly the same dosage but get into your system much quicker (I swear by them!). 

I then took step two at 3pm on Saturday 15/3 - exactly 24 hours after the mifepristone - I inserted the 4 misoprositol vaginally as there is supposedly less side effects doing it this way, I put on a sanitary towel and lay down. 

I lay on the bed for two hours (they recommended at least 30 minutes lying down so the tablets can do their thing and absorb without falling out) I then helped bath my son and said goodnight and got back into my bed and hunkered down for the night with Netflix. 

I didnt feel much. I was anticipating a sudden gush of blood or sudden onset of excruciating pain but I didnt. I did have period cramps after a couple of hours, but nothing that required a hot water bottle or anything like that - this may be because of the pain relief I took prior. 

4 hours passed and I went to the toilet to check. I had started to bleed but only lightly. I did pass a couple of clots (50p size) once I sat on the toilet so I just sat there for a little while. 
Half of one of the tablets came out when I wiped too but this is completely fine as long as you lay down for the 30 minutes after inserting as the medication would have been absorbed by that point. 
I cleaned myself up and went and got back into bed. 
I called the BPAS helpline to see if I needed to take the additional two misoprositol which are given if the bleeding doesnt start or youre only spotting within 4 hours. She asked me to refer to the information booklet I was given in the box that was sent out, and there was a page on bleeding with some diagrams of blood flow. There was spotting and smearing - light flow - moderate flow - heavy flow - and flooding. 
My flow was light from looking at the diagram, it was definitely more than just spotting but I still wouldnt class it as heavy as my usual period flow. She said because I am bleeding and its more than spotting then I dont need to take the additional two misoprositol - which I was pleased about. 

I went to sleep as normal that evening expecting to wake with pain etc but I slept right through until 7am on Sunday morning. 
My flow was still light throughout Sunday, still not experiencing pain - just mild tummy ache and cramps. I was getting a little concerned as I thought surely I should be bleeding more than this? But after reading the information sheet, as long as I was bleeding, and had anywhere from light to heavy bleeding, it was normal and every experience is different. 
I slept in big incontinence knickers that night rather than a sanitary/ maternity towel and Im glad I did! Monday morning I woke up and the bleeding had increased. I was passing larger clots and this felt more like my period on day 1.  Still no pain or cramping but I was getting the urge to go to the toilet and had diarrhoea on and off for a few hours. 
Today is Tuesday and the bleeding is still heavy just like yesterday. No pain or discomfort, but of course Ive got to plan in lots of toilet breaks! 

Overall Im pleasantly surprised with my experience so far. Not once was I crippled over in pain, and things seemed to happen a lot slower with me compared to other threads Ive seen. 
I know its easier said than done, but please try and not work yourself up prior to the treatment if you choose a MA. Just take each hour as it comes.
Some people it seems to start quickly, but for me, I feel the process only really started 48 hours later along with the substantial bleeding. 
I may be part of the minority who has had an experience like this but I wanted to share some positivity on the situation as those who have positive experiences dont seem to write about them as much but they do happen - stay positive and you will get through it in your own way, no matter what you choose to do. 

All I would recommend is being as prepared as possible so you can mentally relax beforehand. Heres a handy list, better to have it and not need it - like me!
* Comfortable bed
* Bed pads or towel to lie on
* Hot water bottle/ heat pad
* Painkillers (pref. ibuprofen but paracetamol work too)
* Sick Bowl
* Water/ lucozade etc. 
* Snacks
* Spare underwear and sanitary bits in the bathroom. 
* Something to preoccupy you, tv, console, book etc. 


Ive been given a pregnancy test, one thats specific to this treatment as apparently the shop bought ones arent appropriate for after a MA as theyre too sensitive. 
Three weeks after I started the treatment (4th April) I have to take the test to see if it was successful, so I will update my post with the outcome!

I just turned 22 and I recently went back to college, I have a lot going on in my life. I was birth control for a few months but I got off because I was gaining a lot of weight quickly. 

I have been dating my bf(25) for almost 5 years now. A little over 2 years ago he got me pregnant on accident when I clearly told him many times I did not want any children while Im very young because Im not mentally stable and I dont have an actual career so I wouldnt be able to support a child. At the time I was working a retail job and he was working also. We did not live together and still dont. I had always told him if we accidentally got pregnant I do not want the baby. 

At the time his family charged him rent (a couple hundred) and he had a room in the garage which was always hot and had other things in it that you would keep in a garage. He pretty much just had his bed in there. At another point he slept in the living room while still paying rent. His parents are extremely hard on him and always are complaining about money so he really does not have his families support. The thought of our child growing up in an environment like that made me really sad and disappointed.

Sorry if this is long but I want to explain why I want to make this decision again. While I was still pregnant I wanted to keep the baby so bad but I told him I wasnt going to. He did not even try to convince me to keep it, did not say he would take care of us or anything. He only mentioned me being pregnant twice. I would try to tell him that I feel really sad, exhausted, sick everyday, and depressed while pregnant and he wouldnt say much. One day I told him how I felt about him not saying much and he went off on me saying he has other things to worry and be sad about like his family member passing away. 

After he went off on me and wouldnt check on me to see how I was doing,feeling, if I needed anything I was more sure about getting the abortion. Ever since then I have been traumatized and regretted my decision. Last year he brought it up and was saying how could I do that and all this stuff and we almost broke up. We got past that and things have been good ever since. 

My bf only had TikTok and Instagram did not follow any girls or anything because he claims to respect me. He only had like 10 followers. This man claims to be in love with me sends me good morning paragraphs every morning. He also claims to be super Christian and he swears hes a saint. Over the weekend I had a strong feeling that I was pregnant again I couldnt sleep on Saturday and I just had a feeling to go through his phone. He doesnt know that I know his password so when he fell asleep I went through it. I looking through messages and just had a feeling I should look at his TikTok saves. He had over 4 videos of other women showing their boobs out and wearing tight clothing. I have never caught him lusting over women on social media. I was so devastated I was shaking. 

I confronted him and he gave me dumb excuses. I dont even know why he was looking at that when I have big boobs. Not to sound weird. I just found out that Im pregnant even though I had a feeling this past weekend. But after seeing that he disrespected me by lusting over other women while he pretends to be a saint, I do not want this baby at all. Im not even thinking about maybe keeping it like the last one. Im disgusted and so hurt. I need advice.

I found out I was pregnant on Sunday (4/6), at just over 5 weeks. My partner and I had a long, emotional conversation. We both did not want to terminate the pregnancy but we looked past our own desires and thought of the baby. It was our first pregnancy (his, mine, ours) unplanned and we both felt we werent in a place to responsibly raise a child. That same day, I scheduled an appointment at Planned Parenthood (PP Center A) for Tuesday (4/8) at 11 A.M.

On Monday morning (4/7), I was notified the appointment had been moved to PP Center B, 40 minutes away. I canceled because I couldnt get there. PP Center A was temporarily closed for maintenance but was scheduled to reopen Thursday (4/10), so I rescheduled for then at 11 A.M.

On Thursday (4/10), we Ubered to PP Center A, only to find it still closed. I called and was told the appointment had been movedagainto PP Center B, but they couldnt honor it anymore. I received no notification of any of this. I was also told there was no record of me booking that appointment; I had the screenshots to prove otherwise. We wasted $30 on a one-way trip.

I looked up other clinics and found PP Center C with an appointment in 90 minutes. We Ubered home (another wasted $30), waited, then went to PP Center C (another $45 total in transportation). We waited over an hour past my scheduled time of 1:30 P.M. There were only three patients ahead of me. I didnt really mind the wait, but it made me even more anxious.

At this point, I was about 6 weeks along. The nurse at Center C was kind and informativeshe did my vitals, a urine test, and prepped me for a vaginal ultrasound. The doctor, though cold, completed the scan. I got a sonogram photo and had blood drawn. The full visit lasted about 3045 minutes. They did not supervise the consumption of the first pill. They gave me the abortion pills (both medications) to take at home.

The next morning (4/11), I got a call from PP Center C. My labs and ultrasound showed signs of early pregnancy lossthe gestational sac wasnt developing properly, and I had already miscarried. I was still instructed to take the medication to expel the tissue. This added another layer of grief to an already painful experience; we didnt even want to go through the abortion process in the first place, and now were finding out this is actually a miscarriage situation.

That same day, I took the first pill. Within an hour, I started cramping and lightly bleeding.

About 24 hours later on 4/12, I took the remaining 4 pills in my cheeks. Within 25 minutes, I was in EXTREMELY intense paincramping, bleeding, sweating, and had diarrhea. I swallowed the remainder of the pills before the 30 minute timer was up. I stripped off all my clothes and used old t-shirts to soak up the POURING sweat. I started passing clots. I was scared as Ive never experienced pain like this, and called my partner urging them to come home. I was begging for help. I then called my cousin (were practically like siblings) for support because I knew they were available. My cousin stayed on the phone with me for 30 minutes while the worst of it passed. I was afraid I was going to pass out and gave my cousin instructions to follow if I became unresponsive. Thats how hurt and scared I felt.

After about 33 minutes, I was able to cool down, unlock the front door for my partner (or emergency services just in case), and get into bed to weather it out on my own until my partner got home. I had diarrhea throughout the day, which stopped by 4/13.

To further add on to the grief, I noticed behavior changes in one of my cats. Before I took at home tests to confirm my pregnancy, I noticed one of my two boys (cats) started cuddling my stomach and sleeping on it. He continued this behavior every day. The day I ingested the first pill, he stopped. He hasnt laid on or slept on my stomach since. Its like he knows. Just makes me extra sad.

Anyways& by today, Monday (4/14), Im still cramping and bleeding. The hot flashes ate milder, and the symptoms felt more like a heavy period. 

I never want to go through any of this ever again.

"711",711,"My Experience Having an Abortion at Women College Bay Center in Toronto","2025-04-14",1744604625,"My Experience Having an Abortion at Women College Bay Center in Toronto","VERY LONG POST
I recently had an Abortion at Bay Center at Women's College in Toronto and wanted to share my experience. I had a hard time finding information so I will go into as much detail as possible. Please feel free to ask any questions. 

Some background: I have a very supportive partner and we have been together for a while but we are both very sure we do not want children, now or ever. 

When I got an unwanted possitive pregnancy test, I did a lot of research and I saw on the Planned Parenthood website the options of places that provided abortions. Based on my research I didn't think the medical abortion was for me, it sounded painful for longer even though the privacy aspect was a plus. I saw that Women's College provided the surgery with general anesthesia and that sounded like a positive to me to not feel/hear/see anything. 
The same day I took the pregnancy test, I called the Bay Center to make an appointment. The receptionist was nice enough but direct. Asked me the first day of my last period, my OHIP number and availibility, they informed me the assesment appointment will be about 3-4 hours. I called on a Wednesday and got an appointment for Monday morning. 

The assesment appointment included: A beginning assesment and walkthough the options, an ultrasound, a discussion about the surgery with a nurse, a physical test and conversation with a doctor, and bloodwork. All of this was done by women and frankly I didn't see a male practictioner in my time there, I'm sure they have some just didn't see any in my experience. 

For my appointment I walked into the 3rd floor of the hospital, checked in (the reception checks in for more than just abortions so it doesn't feel like an intense waiting area) and the first part of the appointment was a consult with a nurse. She asked me about my medical history(have I been pregnant before, first day of last period, sexual history, my partner, my relationship;open or closed, do I feel safe, any abuse, etc) then she asked me how I'm feeling emotionally and about my choice and she walked me through the options for abortion. She was very understanding and gentle and kind and I never felt judged, I know its their job and they wouldn't do that but for some reason I was very worried about it. If I had chose the medical abortion, I could have walked away with the pills that day. I communicated my choice for a surgical abortion and she walked me through what the next steps would be. I also mentioned I am having horrible nausea and she said the doctor can prescribe anti nausea medication, which was honestly the best. She gave me instructions to go to the 2nd floor for an ultrasound and to come back up. 

I was nerveous about the ultrasound, part of me felt like that would make it more real and maybe I would feel more guilt about my choice? The techs were very nice, she asked if I would be okay with a student participating and I said I didn't mind. It was an intervaginal ultrasound, which I wasn't expecting so I had to strip down from the wait down and the gave me a blanket to cover my legs. The screen for the ultra sound was fully facing away from me so I didn't see anything or hear a heartbeat. They asked me how I was doing, I said I was a little nervous and she rubbed my knee and said ""don't worry sweetheart, everything will be okay"" I had no idea how much I needed to hear that until she said that. Once they were done she told me I can go get dressed in the little change rooms they have and wait for their report  in the waiting room. 
I waited about 10 minutes and she came out with a closed envelope told me to go back to the 3rd floor and let reception know that I was back. 

I told reception and handed her the envelope. And sat back down to wait. After about 15 minutes I got called again. I talked to a different women, also very kind and understanding and she said I had a pregnancy measuring 6 weeks and 1 day, she said I will be having a DILATATION &amp; CURETTAGE (D&amp;C) abortion. She walked me through the risks and the procedure and what my appointment the day of the surgery would be. She asked me about my last pap smear, I was due for one and she said the doctor who will be preforming the physical exam could do it for me if I want to, I said sure. She also asked how I feel about my choice and if I would like to talk to one of their counselors, I have a therapist I see weekly so I opted out of it, she also asked about future birth control (I felt a little shame about it since our failed but I think it's great they asked) she also mentioned if I wanted to get an IUD, they could insert it while I'm under after the surgury which I thought was a great idea since I heard IUD insertion can be painful, she also took my weight and height (for anesthesia dosing purposes). At the end she gave me an apointment for surgery for that friday. She said to go back to the waiting room and wait to be called again. 

After 15 minutes, I got called by the doctor, once again had to undress and had a physical exam, including the papsmere, and the doctor gave me the prescription for anti-nausea medication and the request for bloodwork. 

I went to the ground floor, handed my request and waited 10 minutes to get called, got blood work and I was finally out. 

The days between the appointments I was honestly getting more and more nervous, I had this idea that I would feel sad or shame or would never forget it and have a lot of regret. I think a lot of it was fueled by what I saw on line and experiences of ppl that regret it (nothing wrong with this ofcourse, just ended up not being my experience).

THE DAY OF THE ABORTION
I had to fast since the night before, including no water. I showed up for my appointment at 730am, to a full waiting room, I checked in and my partner came with me and just sat in the waiting room.  They came to get me pretty quickly and it was a row of beds separated by screens, I was told to fully undress, take off my jewlery and wait. In total, I think I waited 3 hours before my surgery. Someone came in soon to ""check me in"" took my vitals and gave me a pain killer and another pill, I forgot what it was. A different person from anesthesia department came in to put the needle in my hand for the IV, then a doctor came in, super super sweet, made eye contact, took her time explaining the procedure and the risks and we both signed a sheet of what we talked about. She really calmed my nerves and made me feel a lot better. Most of the time I was alone on my bed and scrolling on my phone and honestly spiral in anxiety. I was texting my partner who was in the waiting room but I wish he could have been in there with me. 
By the time they came to get me for surgery, I was a nervous wreck, part of it was the weight of the decision, part of it was being im the hospital and the procedure itself. They wheeled me and the bed into the OR room. Seeing all the lights and all the people and tools, and laying in this weird bed I just started tearing up. The nurse was so sweet and talked to me said everything will be okay and over before I even notice and wiped my tears away. They explained I was going to go to sleep now, they put an oxygen mask on me and they connected the IV, I was out so fast. 
After the successful procedure, they wheeled me back to where I was previously and called my partner in to see me. That is when I woke up. I was definitely loopy and disoriented but happy it was done and to see my partner, I honestly would have been scared if he wasn't there. 
Someone came in to ask me how I'm feeling, gave me some digestive cookies and juice and a couple of antibiotics, and told me about post op stuff to know(bleeding expectations, no alcohol or driving for 2 days, no inserting anything for 2 weeks). About 20 minutes later, when I felt more aware, they put me in a wheelchair and I was off and done with!!

In conclusion, I had a great experience getting this procedure done at Women's College and every person I met was incredibly nice and professional and I am so thankful for everyone there. I also want to say how incredible greatful I feel to live in Canada and have these options fully covered by OHIP and the ability to make a choice with my body. 
Emotionally, I think I made the correct decision, after the pregnancy symptoms went away I finally feel like myself again and since it happened I have not regreted it for a second. 

If anyone read the whole thing, thank you for reading and if you are in a similar spot, I hope my experience could be of even a small help. If anyone has any questions, please let me know.

"713",713,"8 week old abortion at 22, this is my experience","2025-04-13",1744515564,"8 week old abortion at 22, this is my experience","Hello, Im 22 from the USA and I found out I was pregnant on March 25th. I have a loving boyfriend and I have been with him for 3 and a half years. We just moved away from my home state to more of a southern state. A lot of the people around me have different views on abortion and fall on the republican side where I am more center democrat. 

This being said, we are both not in the time and place in our life where we can raise a child. I had just started my new job after being unemployed for 6 months the day before I found out I was pregnant. 

We decided it wasnt time and we were not going to go through with the pregnancy. I luckily live in a state where it is legal to have an abortion but if I were any state more south it would have been illegal/possible jail time. I contacted some close friends and my older sister for advice and they helped me set up an appointment with a doctor. The first appointment I tried to get off was April 4th but my boss said I could not take the day off/leave early to get to the appointment. So I had to push it to April 11th in the morning so I could come in slightly late. It was honestly scary that I was pushing it out so far. I wanted to take care of this as soon as possible. 

When the day of the appointment came it was in a parenthood clinic and I walked in surrounded by other pregnant women with their spouses and plenty of pregnancy support signs. I wont lie, I kind of felt like an imposter as I was alone and not showing at all. I finally got my name called and the nurse who got me seemed a little off. She didnt talk to me much just took my vitals and asked some questions about my health. Asked if I have ever been pregnant before and told me to pee in a cup. It wasnt a warm experience and I was so nervous. 

She let me know the doctor would be in soon and left me in the room. Once again I was looking at all of the pregnancy signs in the room& Then the doctor came in with an ultrasound machine and asked me to get on the bed. She warned me the goo would be cold then asked if I would like to see the ultrasound. I said I did, of course I felt connected with the fetus I just know I cant give the baby the life it deserves right now& she showed me while she pointed out my uterus and the blob inside. I asked if it was possibly twins(as they run in my family) she said no. Then I asked how old it was. The measurements told her it was 8 weeks. 

She had me sit up and she packed up the machine and we started going over how it works. She explained I would take the first pill, Mifepristone, in the office which wont cause bleeding (maybe a little spotting) and then 24 hours later I would take the second pill, misoprostol, at home. I could either take the four misoprostol pills orally and let them dissolve in my cheeks for 30 min or take the four pills vaginally. She did say vaginally would most likely work a little faster. She said it will feel like a heavier period and maybe a bit more cramping than usual. Some people dont have it too bad some some people have it worse. I may have misunderstood but I thought she said I wouldnt bleed for 2-3 hours but that wasnt the case. There was chance for nausea, dizziness, diarrhea, and light headedness. After explaining, I had to sign a form saying I am consenting to ending the pregnancy and she gave me the first pill with water. 

She asked if I had questions and I just asked what is more likely to work, orally or vaginally, but she said they are both equally effective. When I checked out I scheduled an appointment for three weeks later so they can double check it actually worked. Then I left. I wont lie when I got back to my car I cried a bit and called my boyfriend who gave me the support I needed. As much as I was 100% ok with my decision I just know of what the potential could have been for the baby. So that was quite upsetting. Of course I know I made the hard  decision but no one wants to go through this. 

The next morning I had my misoprostol and some extra strong ibuprofen that was prescribed. My boyfriend brought me out to breakfast first and we talked about it one last time. We were sure this is the right choice. We got home and I wanted to go through this alone so my boyfriend went off to go do some house work and other errands around town. 

The experience:

I got comfy on the couch and laid down to insert the four pills vaginally at about 10am. The doctor said to lay down for 30 minutes while it absorbed. Before I get to this next part I have read that other women have had better and worse experiences. This is purely my personal experience and I will say it was more on the worse side. 

The first 30 minutes I didnt feel like much. Towards the end I could feel maybe a slight cramp but more like the cramps u can kinda get before your period starts. Nothing major. After an hour (11am) is when I could feel a little more. Just like a typical period but not any blood. I went to the bathroom because I thought maybe I was bleeding but it was just a little discharge with some blood in it. 

Around 11:30am is when it started to hurt like one of my really bad periods and I was hoping it would stay like that and not get any worse. Boy was I wrong. Around now is when I thought I should take my pain meds but looking back I definitely should have taken them as soon as I inserted the other pills to pre-prep for the pain to come. About 12:20 I started feeling nausea and extreme cramping so I went to the bathroom to set up a hot bath. Hot baths always help with my pain because it makes my brain go a little numb to other pain. I got in the bath then almost immediately I felt I was going to throw up with no warning. I barely made it over to the toilet before throwing up all of my breakfast and the pain pills I had just taken. I emptied my whole stomach to the point where it was just bile coming out. This is when I started getting the shakes like a fever, it was like I was both hot and cold at the same time. I tried drinking my water but each time I did it just made me throw up more. 

At 12:26 I texted my boyfriend no blood yet then literally 5 min later at 12:31 I texted him Nope just started bleeding I was sitting in the tub trying to get through the cramps which was getting really really really bad and I tried getting out to walk around hoping it would help. I kept switching between trying to get in bed to curl up and use a heating pad to going to the toilet to try and push and getting in the tub trying to help the pain. Nothing was helping. Nothing I did made me comfortable. I ended up laying in the tub using a towel as a pillow (it got soaked) while I was pretty much moaning like I was in labor. 

Around 1pm I was saying omg this is horrible and I just wanted the pain to stop. I kept switching between the tub and toilet again for the next hour. Around 2pm I was sitting on the toilet and bleeding A LOT, I could almost feel like part of me was coming out. I went to stand up to go back in the tub because it hurt so bad and as I stood up I felt like a pop come out of my vagina and it was the tiny fetus it was about the size of a kidney bean. i started bleeding even more as I stepped back in the tub. As I got in I felt an even bigger thing go out of me and it was the size of my palm. It might have been the placenta? I am not sure, or it was just a HUGE amount of uterine tissue. As soon as that fell out I felt IMMEDIATE relief. Its like the pain stopped almost instantly. 

I picked up the fetus and put it on the side of the tub. I felt I needed some closure to really see what it was. A lot of the pictures I saw online made me feel very guilty because it looks so developed. I could definitely see the outline of its head shape as well as a spine slightly forming but it really just looked like a goop of discharge you can get but a little more solid. I wont lie, I could see one arm and one leg. I wonder if the other arm and leg just hadnt formed yet or if the baby might have been growing deformed. You could slightly see the spine and it had two little black dots for eyes. Looking at it tho you could definitely tell there was no consciousness. That definitely gave me closure. I decided I wanted to burry the fetus and plant a tree above it in memory. 

My experience was not slight cramping like I was expecting, it was pretty bad. After it all came out it had just felt like a normal period but with extra big blood clots and a bit of more blood. 

As I type this, it is 11:15 pm the same day, so Im not sure how it will go over the next few days. The doctor said my period could last 1-2 weeks. 

Im so very lucky to live in a place where I can make the decision I need for my own body and my own life. As well as having a support circle to talk to during this time. I definitely never want to go through this again  and have started the pill birth control to ensure when I am ready to have a baby its within my control. I do have a little bit of guilt just  thinking of what it could have been but at the end of the day this is the best decision for me. I might get some hate but I think its important to share my experiences so other women can hear what its like. 

Thank you for reading my story and I hope you all have a wonderful day.

I already knew that this would be a difficult decision as Im older and not a teen anymore. My boyfriend and I already discussed when we first got together that we didnt want kids for a while as we are young and want to enjoy the youth. So we agreed on an abortion however as my appointment got close I constantly broke down questioning if this is really what I wanted to do. And telling him was difficult cause I didnt want to put him through something he isnt ready for. I want to have kids but its just too soon mainly for him. We followed through and got the pills. First pill and dose were simple for me. I waited the proper time, symptoms were the worst and nothing seemed to help. There was no bleeding or clotting. It was finally time for the second dose and my mind did a whole 180 and refused to take the pills. I had my boyfriend calm me down and support me till I was ready to take the dose again. I didnt start to bleed till the next day and it was extremely light and only when I went to the restroom. Which my doctor said would be a concern after the 24 hour mark so I was able to get in asap to see whats going on. I went back in seeing maybe it was a sign to stop if this really did fail and I really hoped for a miracle during the ultrasound. Bad news came and my uterus was mostly cleared and I guess my body didnt have much to pass anyways cause so early. Yeah hearing the news broke me a little and I cried on the way home. However I knew it was meant to be but I cant help but blame myself for ruining a good thing I could have had. Im starting to get angry at myself and my boyfriend which I feel horrible cause hes done nothing but be there for me.

My boyfriend and I are in the shocking and upsetting situation many of us have found us in. I havent entirely made up my mind but I also know that Im not emotionally, mentally and financially ready to raise a child. Unfortunately Im in Houston Texas and so we are attempting to gather as much information as we can to find the best path to keep us legally safe if do move forward.

Ive taken 5 tests in the past 48 hours and the lines were faint but it seemed pretty evident that the result is pregnant. Nevertheless Im still in denial& Im four days late and wondering if its safe to go to my OBGYN to confirm?? Has anyone in Texas or Houston specifically been through something similar. I just really want confirmation that Im actually pregnant but I know time is critical and im not sure whether she could report me if she has me pregnant on record and Im suddenly not pregnant a few months later??? Where can I learn more about my rights in this situation and in Texas? 

Im also interested in hearing stories from woman who went to a specific clinic out of state (we are looking at Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, or Illinois) or opted to mail in pills to use at home? I would like to do the mail in but the legality seems iffy and Im scared about what would happen to me if I had complications, where I should go/if its safe to go somewhere in Houston. 

 Im at the 5 week mark from my last period and based off my initial searches, if I do move forward with an abortion I want to move quickly and ideally get it done within 10 weeks so that I can do the pill.

Ive been in a daze since I took the first test and I still cant believe this is happening to me.

So here it goes :)

Ive always been super careful because the idea of getting pregnant scared me. I knew that if it ever happened, Id keep the baby no matter what. And then it did happen, and I totally lost my cool. My boyfriend was there for me, offering all the support and care I needed. I found out on the 8th, took a day to process it, went to the doctor on the 10th, and finally had the SA on the 11th. My boyfriend made sure everything was as stress-free as possible. But on the day of the SA, I was this close to changing my mind. I was shattered and in physical pain. Im someone who usually lacks empathy, so I might not have grasped the depth of the situation, but now Im paranoid, thinking my baby is calling out for me, waiting in the dark alleys of the hospital. Ive started being passive-aggressive toward my boyfriend, though he doesnt realize it. If only hed shown a bit more courage, if only hed told me he wanted the baby. But the second he got the news, he went into problem-solving mode, like it was just something to fix. Im so frustrated, angry, guilty, and hurt right now, feeling like Im on autopilot. At 23, just graduated, no job, strict parentsI wouldnt have changed my mind. It was the right decision, but the what ifs still linger. Im losing my mind.

Please guide. Anything shared with kindness will help. I dont want to fall back to medications that I struggled to recover from. (BPD patient).","abortion",5,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jqwvzf/23f_feeling_guiltyashamedrelievedlost_all_at_once/"

I found out I was pregnant on 3/3 after having some symptoms - extreme fatigue, sore boobs, nausea (especially when brushing my teeth) and a late-ish period. I'm usually really tired and have sore boobs before my period so I didn't think any of it until I realised these were not disappearing like they do just before my period starts. 

My boyfriend was happy to support me, no matter my decision. I'm in the UK and initially contacted BPAS but was told they don't cover my area so I ended up going through my local service. I called up on 4/3 and had a telephone consultation with a nurse on 6/3. I picked up the tablets on 12/3 - in my pack I had the 2 sets of tablets needed for the MA, codeine and 2 pregnancy tests along with some info leaflets. I was only working a few days a week leading up to the MA due to days off anyway so it worked out. 

I took the mifepristone on Fri 14/3 morning (day 1) around 6:45am before work and had no issues all day. Then on Sat 15/3 (day 2) around 12:45pm I got myself ready with maxi pads, 800mg Ibuprofen (codeine makes me too woozy) and inserted the 4 misoprostol. The cramps started around 45mins later with some bleeding. The bleeding was less than I expected but I was only 5wks 5days at this point so thought it was fine. The pain would come and go through the evening but I was ok because of the regular Ibruprofen doses. I passed some clots and the pregnancy because when I woke up on Sun 16/3 I felt so much better! I wasn't as tired, boobs returned to normal and the nausea was gone. I bled some more but not much. 

Nothing could have prepared me for day 3 &amp; 4 - the bleeding was heavy, passing clots and terrible diarrhoea. I wasn't working so was able to deal with this at home. I went back to work on day 5 and the bleeding was like a period then tapered off. Day 10-13 were horrendous, heavy heavy bleeding with huge clots (changing a maxi pad every hr on day 11-12), bad shivering and nausea again on day 10.  I had to take time off work and had my boyfriend stay at home with me as I thought I needed to go to hospital. I called the nurse who explained this was the uterus doing it's best to remove everything. I also started breaking out in hives like an allergic reaction which I read is normal in pregnancy due to hormone changes. It all finally calmed down by day 15 and it's now ompletely stopped at day 20. I'm back to my normal self and I'm due to take a test next week. 

Physically, this has been draining. I'm now slightly anaemic and breathless due to the amount of blood lost. Mentally, it's been a rollercoaster. I've been through every emotion but the most important thing is that I feel relieved. I did feel isolated and  regretful but reading everyone's experience has helped me so much. This sounds crazy but before this I wasn't sure if I wanted kids but now I'm sure I do. I think I'm just sad that this is what had to happen for me to come to this decision. I'm 33, this was totally unplanned and this just wasn't the right time for my boyfriend and I. 

No matter what, don't let anyone sway you from doing what's right for yourself in the situation. This is our right as women to decide what we do with our bodies. I know I'm incredibly blessed to be in a country where this can all be easily accessed. Those who haven't been through this don't understand the agony of making the hard decision to have an MA/SA. We should be supporting people's healthcare decisions, not bringing them down or shaming them.

So, two big life events back to back. When she got back from the trip, she discussed breaking up. It was very shocking. She blamed that she is a poor communicator and has been bottling up feelings throughout our relationship.

I found I was pregnant on 03/21/2025. I made my appointment for a MA with pp on 03/26/2025. I conceived on 03/01/2025 so that put me at about 3 weeks and 4 days but from my last period it's 5 weeks and 2 days. They didn't see anything on ultrasound which was likely because I was so early. So they took my hcg level which was 1200. I took the mifo in the clinic and 4 hours later entered the miso 4 pills vaginal and I was so scared that it was going to hurt I even had my primary care Dr prescribe Vicodin. But after the miso I didn't start cramping or bleeding until later that night which was just spotting no cramps even the next day 03/27/2025 just spotting I didn't even have to wear a pad and weird brown discharge kinda clot looking. I had my follow up for another ultrasound and blood draw on 03/28/2025 nothing on ultrasound but that day I did actually start bleeding blood and tissue but again no cramps. Just for the weekend I bleed but not hella blood how everyone makes it seem and it wasn't painful at all more like normal period cramps and they said at my 03/28/2025 that my levels may drop over the weekend because I had barely started bleeding 2 hours before my appointment. So to bring some relief it did take almost 48 hours to start seeing red blood but I wss still scared it didn't work because everyone I was talking to and reading they bleed within the first couple hours I did have spotting 8 hours after miso but like i said didn't even need a pad and just would wipe and be brown discharge and the left over pills and weird brown clots like dry brown clots. But if you have no blood at all not even brown or spotting blood in 24 hours call your provider for more medication. They called the next day that my levels did rise again to 1600 so I had a follow up again on 04/01/2025 for another ultrasound and blood draw to see if I needed more  medication or it was successful they called today 04/02/2025 a week after taking miso and my levels went down to 220 meaning it was successful. Everyone's bodies are different but my experience it didn't hurt at all I'm telling you guys I took ibuprofen and didn't feel a thing didn't even feel any cramping or labor pains not once felt like I had to throw up or faint  now this might be because of how early I was. And my bleeding has basically stopped at this point now it's just brown discharge when I wipe which yesterday scared me even more that it didn't work because most people bleed for a week but I only bleed for three days. I didn't fill up a maxi pad all the way and moved down to level 4 pads and had to only change them 3 times a day maybe one day I had to change it 4 times. If your feeling like your abortion failed just be patient and please keep following up with doctors and doing blood work that was the only thing that gave me relief.

When I found out I was pregnant, I was so happy and certain that I wanted to keep it. I have always wanted to be a mother and i felt in my heart that it was right to keep it. I never really considered an abortion, even if my situation was complicated. The father did not want me to keep it, he blocked me and said to not contact him again, he was not going to be in the life of the baby. I felt horrible but still thought i could do it with the support of my family. But then i told my family and it all changed. They started to pressure me to get an abortion. For context: i am still a student, financially dependent on my parents, and living at home. My degree is pretty flexible so i could have accomodated for a child and i will finish it soon. Financially my parent would have covered for me. My family is usually very supportive and loving and i know they want the best for me, however, they put so much pressure on me to get an abortion. 24/7 i was hearing how bad it would go if i kept the kid, how difficult i was making life for myself. I was never going to get a good job, and that my kid would have to grow up with a stressed-out mum who wouldn't have time for it. This last thing is why i ended up going though with the abortion. My sister also kept insiting how my mental health was too bad to take care of a kid. Which looking back i realised was not true, it was hormonal, but now after the abortion it certainly is. I know it would have been complicated to keep it, but it is what i knew in my heart i wanted and i know it would have worked out. I know my family wanted to help but i feel like i didn't take this decision for me or for my baby in the end, but for them. I was so stressed out and emotional from the pregnancy hormones, i could not think straight. I also only had little time left before i was not allowed to have an abortion anymore, and on top end of year exams, it was all too much and i just wanted it all to end, so i had the abortion. and i thought after having it it would be clear to me that i made the right decision, but this never happend. quite the oposit. i felt all my insecurities and worries were less after not being influenced by the pregnancy hormones and thought i could have managed and why did i not keep it. The weeks after i just distracted myself and didn''t grieve through the abortion, but now 4 months later it is all coming up again. I found out a close friend to mine is pregnant now and i can't help but feel hurt. I feel that should have been me. I feel angry at anyone with babies or little kids. I'm so angry at my family. And i tried telling them how i feel and that i felt they put too much pressure on me, but they just don't get it. I absolutely regret not trusting myself, not going for what i really wanted and let myself be influenced by others. I have so much regret and grief and feel like a horrible person. My mind keeps replaying the whole thing trying to figure out a way of making it right. I also keep worrying i will never find a partner that wants kids with me in the future, and i lost my only chance at becoming a mum. Or that i can't have kids for whatever reason. . Anyways, i think i am just looking for people who can relate to these feelings or who know how to deal with this grief.","abortion",5,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jpvm78/forced_abortion_and_regret/"

Is it normal to want the baby so bad but still go through with it? I know we cant provide the life we would want for a child but a big part of me selfishly wants to have my baby.

I also feel incredibly guilty and sad for women who cannot have children or have lost them, it feels like Ive been given a baby when Im not deserving.

I havent really told anyone, my boyfriends mum knows but I havent and will never tell my parents.

This weekend was the end of my week 6 of pregnancy. On Friday morning I lit a candle and wrote a letter to the baby spirit (idk if I believe in that but seemed to help me come to terms with what was happening). At noon I took mifepristone. Felt nauseated and tired, as id been feeling for the past few weeks. 

Saturday morning I had sex and then started bleeding a lot before even taking the misoprostol, but didnt have any cramps or pain at that point. (Idk why this happened) 

At noon on Saturday I took the max dosage of Advil II (which is Advil + Tylenol), 1 zofran and a weed edible. Then I inserted 4 miso tablets vaginally and lay in bed for an hour. I was already bleeding heavily from just the mifepristone, which is pretty weird I think. 

Cramps started around 2pm and a lot of small clots started coming out. The bleeding was like a heavy period. I was nauseated but didnt throw up. Steady intake of saltines + Ginger ale helped. At this point I did a yoga sequence I put together that I thought would help, and it definitely seemed to.

The cramps were bad (but not as bad as my worst period cramps or getting an IUD inserted) from about 3 - 7pm. I lay on a heating pad and watched TV while my partner rubbed my lower back, which helped a lot. At 7 I took another 2 Advil II and half an edible again. 

I went to bed at around 11, had uncomfortable cramps and was gassy and bloated, so I didnt sleep very well. 

I woke up feeling a lot better. Still bleeding and some cramping (like a medium period amount). My boobs no longer hurt, Im energetic and Im not nauseous anymore. 

Overall it was much much better than I expected. I was actually worried that maybe it didnt work, but I think it did. 

Heres what I think helped: 
- Advil II (Advil + Tylenol) 
- edible (THC + CBD) 
- yoga poses (hip openers, twists and forward folds) 
- lots of physical touch from my partner (releases lots of feel good hormones and chemicals&including sex before hand) (by partner I mean the guy I met 2 months ago who accidentally got me pregnant on our third date lol) 
- a good TV show to binge 
- plenty of easy to digest food, Gatorade, tea, water, etc.

I dont want to go into too much detail about everything, but I was there for about 5 hours. (I was there a bit longer figuring out the steps for me with some medical issues that couldve possibly gotten in the way.) I had blood pricked from my finger, I discussed birth control, I had a vaginal ultrasound, and in my case we did a breath test because I have asthma. After that I was sent to a changing room and waited some more.

My doctors and I decided that if I could bear it I should go without anesthesia thanks to my various issues. I was just thankful to be able to drink some water after 8+4 1/2 hours of fasting lol. So I drank my water, and I locked in not being able to have anesthesia.

My legs were put in hanging stirrups instead of the usual metal ones, it definitely helped with the shaking and involuntary twitching from pain. I was injected twice with lidocaine in my uterus. Speculum wasnt bad. But then came the dilator. 

My doctors told me everything happening as it happened, and omfg as the first dilation happened my ears starting ringing. I couldnt help but gasp and let out painful noises. I was trying to be as still as possible. 

When the second dilation came I started basically screaming. My doctor was working quickly, so the suction came immediately after that. The screaming would make me bear down which would hurt me more. I hyperventilated a bit because I didnt know what to do since I was stopping myself from squirming. It was a type of pain Id never felt before, and I have a high pain tolerance. It wasnt the worst pain Id ever felt, but wow I could not stop the yelling and afterward gagging from that feeling. 9/10 pain for sure. Thankfully, the painful part lasted only 2 maybe 3 minutes tops.  

Unfortunately, there was no immediate relief. I was in so much pain for that brief time that I barely followed directions to help me slide over into the gurney to the recovery room. Im so shy and wouldve preferred to put my pad and panties on myself but I was doing everything I could to just focus on the fact that it would soon be over, I let them do everything for me for those next 10 minutes. 

They sat me up and gave me a glove full of hot water (lol) to use as a heating pad. I think the ibuprofen (that they only gave afterward), the heat, and sitting up really helped relieve those cramps. 

By 20 minutes it just felt like mild period cramps. By 30 I was walking out of the room shaky, but absolutely fine. 

It couldve been so much worse and as much pain as I was in it was completely worth it. Even now Im just chillin and the bleeding is really minimal. I want to be as real as possible and I dont want to scare anybody from it. Its going to be uncomfortable regardless of your choice but if you choose this particular path with no anesthesia, I just want you to know whats coming up and the fact that though its so painful, its such a small time of pain and not a bad amount of recovery time. 

Less related, I was told my pregnancy was abnormal and likely to miscarry regardless of my choice. Idk how to feel about that& should I have just let things taken course or was it good that I did it this way? Sigh. At least its done.

I enjoyed reading all the stories of women who had abortions prior to getting mine, and I thought Id share my story in case it could make someone feel better. Im 21 and I live in Spain, I got a surgical abortion today and I went with general anesthesia. I was worried about stupid things like oh what if the doctor thinks my vagina looks weird or what if I should have shaved bla-bla-bla but truth is none of that matters. 

I went in at noon and left at 2:30PM. Started with an echograph and they asked a lot of questions like allergies etc. I was initially supposed to stay awake and do just a local anesthesia but then the nurses told me it might hurt and since I already had enough stress and anxiety, I agreed to general anesthesia. I dont remember anything from the moment I got sedated until when I woke up. I have period like cramps at the moment and a little bit of bleeding but nothing too severe. I also heavily dislike hospitals and all just because it freaks me out but the anesthesia helped a lot, I couldnt imagine doing this awake to be honest. Right now, I feel a little loopy but its manageable. The pregnancy symptoms went away RIGHT AWAY which is mind blowing. 

I was able to keep all my piercings in but had to take off one of my fake nails for the little finger monitor thing. 

Emotionally, I know it was the right decision and I have no regret. I regret that I had to make this choice in the first place because although I am all the way pro-choice, I still feel bad for the little bean but I wish him the best wherever he is at the moment. I think personally Ill always remember him and I dont ever want to go through this process again, which is why Ill be a whole lot more careful when it comes to contraception.

I Chose Myself - Has Anyone Else Found Happiness After This?","2025-03-24",1742799761,"I Left a Controlling Relationship and ended a pregnancy. I Chose Myself - Has Anyone Else Found Happiness After This?","I (26F) just left a four-year relationship with my ex (31M) and ended a pregnancy at the same time. Im struggling with a lot of emotions- grief, anger, relief, and anxiety about the future. I need to hear from others who have been in a similar situation: does it get better?

To sum up, for four years I was with a man who was emotionally abusive, manipulative, and controlling. The relationship was full of gaslighting, criticism, and cycles of love-bombing followed by demeaning comments and emotional neglect. I finally left and moved out, ready to start fresh, only to find out shortly after that I was pregnant.

I was only five weeks along when I told him, and I was immediately met with pressure, control, and a complete disregard for my autonomy. I told him I wasnt ready to share the news with anyone, especially since I was having doubts about continuing the pregnancy. But he didnt care he told his family and friends anyway, completely ignoring my feelings in the process. It felt like the pregnancy gave him a new level of power over me, and it got worse from there.

He policed everything I ate, demanding I write down my meals so he could approve them.
He constantly told me I wasnt exercising enough or taking care of the baby properly, making me feel like I was already failing as a mother.
When I voiced my fears and doubts, he told me I was being immature, selfish, and irrational. 
He even said he didnt want to be with me anymore, but we were having a child together so we had to try, as if I no longer had a say in my own life.
When I threw up due to morning sickness, he didnt comfort me, instead he interrogated me about what I had eaten, telling me not to eat certain things again.

At one point, he said: I dont give a shit if youre unhappy, the child will die or have defects if you dont do what I say. Thats when I knew, I couldnt do this. I couldnt bring a child into this. I had already spent years doubting myself, shrinking myself, bending over backward to make this relationship work even staying when he cheated, lied, or disrespected me. I wasnt going to spend the rest of my life under his control, raising a child in the same toxic cycle.

I had an abortion. It was one of the hardest things Ive ever done, but I knew it was the right decision.

Im now one month post-abortion and have completely cut contact with him. Ive moved away, focusing on rebuilding my life. But I still struggle with feelings of guilt, sadness, and anger, not about the abortion itself, but about the fact that I spent so much of my 20s in a relationship that drained me. Sometimes, I fear that Ill never find real love, that Ill never have children in a safe, healthy, and loving environment. I grew up with an addict dad who was mostly absent, and a mum who struggled and was depressed a lot of my childhood. It broke my heart to think I could be repeating some cycles. I had to break it. I dont want my decision to be in vain, I want to do better, be better, and accept a better kind of love into my life. I want kids and a family so badly, but I want it to be a loving dynamic. 

So Im looking for advice, or even just encouragement from anyone whos been in a similar situation. Did you leave an emotionally abusive relationship, regain your confidence, and go on to have a happy future? I could really use some stories of hope right now.

I decided to go to Planned Parenthood to have a Medical Abortion. I didn't have anyone to drive me for a Surgical Abortion so I opted for the Medical one instead. I've been scrolling relentlessly through Reddit and reading people's timelines when taking the MA, so I decided to post my own. I chose to have this abortion because I wasn't ready, and my partner and I are long-distance, so it'd be hard to go through this pregnancy by myself. I prepped everything in my house since I'd be going through this experience by myself. 

3/22 (Saturday) 1:50PM - Took Mifepristone at the clinic.

3/22 (Saturday) 3PM: Went to pick up my prescribed ibuprofen 800MG and Tramadol 50MG (This one is an opioid and I'd only take it if the pain is truly severe but hoping to ride it out and not use this)

3/22 (Saturday) 6PM: I have a meal 2 hours before I take the pills. I didn't want to eat too close to the pills because of potential nausea/vomiting.

3/22 (Saturday) 8PM: I have the ibuprofen and a chewable anti-nausea pill they gave me at the clinic.

3/22 (Saturday) 8:30PM: I insert the 4 pills v\*ginally and am instructed to lay down for 45 minutes. Watching Desperate Housewives to pass the time.  

3/22 (Saturday) 8:55PM: Very light cramping (2/10), pretty gassy but overall fine. 

3/22 (Saturday) 9:15PM: It's been 45mins, still gassy and light cramping 4/10 now and feel a little sharper. I don't think I've felt any bleeding yet. 

3/23 (Sunday) 12:17am: Woke up from my nap and went to the bathroom. 9/10 cramps, sweating, chills, diarrhea. Passed a huge clot, dont know if it's the whole thing but it's huge.

  
3/23 (Sunday) 12:30am: Pain comes in a weird wave, like a contraction. Groaning like hell. 10/10 cramps for a while. 

3/23 (Sunday) 1:01am: The pain eased up to a 5-6/10.

3/23 (Sunday) 2:27am: I'm getting the pain in waves again but it's a 7/10, still hurts tho.

3/23 (Sunday) 3:54am: Cramps are 5/10 again and I can finally retake the 800mg of ibuprofen. After this, I fell asleep.

  
I woke up at 10am and saw a lot of clotting pass but I think the clot I passed at 12:17am was it, bc it looked about an inch long. Overall, would've opted for the SA if it was available to me. I won't lie, the pain was a lot at one point but glad I got through it and didn't have to take the tramadol (opioid). No nausea nor vomiting symptoms occurred, but I did take the anti-nausea pills before hand. ","abortion",2,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1ji1ulr/f25_doing_a_ma_by_myself_florida/"

I wanted to share my MA experience as this was the first time I had ever had one. Im 28 and my partner and I both mutually decided we werent ready to have a child. I live in AZ where abortion is legal, but they make you jump through hoops before you get one.

I noticed right at 4 weeks my period was late and took a pregnancy test that ended up being positive. I scheduled a doctors appointment for the next day where they confirmed the pregnancy and referred me to a clinic. I went to a clinic the day after that and was too early to show anything on the ultra sound as they confirmed I was only 4 weeks. They also wouldnt prescribe me the pills for the MA. 

I went back two weeks later and was at 6 weeks and showing on the ultra sound. The had me take the first pill in office and sent me home with the remaining 4 pills and a pregnancy test. The first pill I literally felt no side effects from and resumed my day as normal. 

I waited exactly 24 hours to take the next set of pills. I made sure to hydrate, take zofram, and ibuprofen and Tylenol an hour before taking the pills. I inserted them vaginally and laid down for 30 mins. The cramping started right after that and I used the rest room an hour after I took the pills and had started bleeding but nothing too crazy and hadnt passed any clots yet. I would say cramping was around 3/10 pain level wise at this point.

Around the 2 hour mark I started passing my first clots. They were probably the size of a lime but it wasnt anything scary and my doctor told me the size of the clot doesnt matter as long as youre passing them. Around 3 hours is when I noticed I started passing tissue as well. Again nothing crazy, bleeding was substantial but pain was tolerable with the use of a heating pad and ibuprofen. I would put the pain at a 7/10.


The pain went down a lot after I passed the blood clots and tissues and I continued to bleed a little bit for the next few days.

I found out I was pregnant a few days ago (medically 4 weeks along) and have my appointment at the clinic on Saturday to receive my medical abortion tablets. 
I have a rave planned with my friends tomorrow (Friday) that Im really looking forward to. Usually when I attend raves, I will take ecstasy in tablet form (only half a pill). I would still like to enjoy my night tomorrow but Im worried that if I have ecstasy/ class As in my system, the medical abortion wont be as effective.
I know the easiest answer would be not to take anything/ not attend but my friends will think something is wrong and I dont feel comfortable enough to tell them why, and I wouldnt feel comfortable asking my nurse at the appointment either. 
Or would a better alternative be to start the medical abortion on Sunday so it would be 48 hours after Id had the ecstasy? 
I dont plan on drinking any alcohol as I know this thins my blood which could add a potential risk when Ill already be loosing blood. 
I have had an abortion previously ( last year) so Im familiar w the process and what to expect mentally and physically.
Again, Im sorry if this comes across as shallow and that I dont care about the procedure, I do but Im just trying to enjoy my life at the same time :)

we've been trying to get a steady head on ourselves before we find our own place, which will likely be right when he comes back, and we're both fairly young. again, its just not the right time to have a baby.

of course its only the first day, and im still in shock as well. i will say, he took it very very well and i couldnt explain how grateful i am to have him. at the same time, i dont really have close friends or any sort of support system to lean on, and im struggling to keep my head above water. im extremely torn with no shoulder to cry on about it.. thats basically my story.

I am not very religious, but 3 days before my scheduled abortion I prayed to give me strength throughout this process and that I just wanted to know I was making the right decision.

The next day I miscarried. This is a really painful process and it is a lot on my body mentally and physically. I am very sad to know that I have miscarried, I was also very sad to know that I was going to have to terminate my own pregnancy solely just on not receiving the support.

04/15 - 10:30pm took 4 200mg of Advil. 
 - 11:42pm - I took 4 misoprostol and allowed them to dissolve for 30 minutes until I swallowed the remaining with Powerade. 

04/16 - around 1am I did start to feel cramps but no bleeding. I did throw up within the first 3 hours. 

- 2:30am - I took another 2 misoprostol and allowed them to dissolve for 30 minutes again. 

- 3:30am - 4:00am - a lot of back n forth to the bathroom. Period like cramps &amp; blot clots did pass through. I did throw up again but I felt okay afterwards. 

- 11:00am - I fell asleep for the rest of the morning &amp; ate small snacks in between not ready for the last round. 

- 11:30am - I take 2 midols.

- 12:30pm - I take the last 2 dosage &amp; allowed to dissolve for 30 minutes then swallowed. 

1:00 - rest of the day - small mild cramp while laying down with a few sharp cramps when going to the bathroom. The blood isnt the heavy anymore, just feels like a normal period.

I went in for a consultation in late February and they had me fill out many consent forms and information about my health history, then did an ultrasound and a blood draw. I scheduled the follow up appointment for early march, a little over a week later. I ended up proceeding with my second appointment. At first, I thought I wanted medication rather than surgery because it seemed less invasive. After reading about the experiences of others on this sub, and given how busy I am as a college student with an internship, I opted for an SA because I didnt think I could handle an MA alone with no guarantee that my partner would be home when the medication would work. 

I was 10 weeks 6 days on the date of the procedure. They had me speak to a counselor who asked some questions about my health history and whether I was being pressured to get an abortion (I was not.) He gave me a pill to take and then I was led to another room with lots of chairs and someone administered the IV meds. They took me to a private room a few minutes after that, and the surgeon came in after i undressed (waist down only) held my hand in hers and asked how I was feeling. It was so nice to feel supported in that moment. I barely remember the conversation but I was talking most of the time and was relatively lucid. I felt some pressure on my cervix/midsection at certain times but it was an overall painless procedure. The bedside manner of everyone involved was extremely kind and empathetic. They monitored me in a recovery room for at least half an hour before I felt the sedation had worn off. 

The cost came out to $490 total, including the initial consultation. My partner was supportive and paid entirely out of pocket because I did not want record of it on my state health insurance. There was only one moment where I experienced debilitating pain, and it was later that night in my bathroom where I keeled over on the ground and passed some tissue on the toilet. The pain lasted maybe ten minutes, and I think a pill fell out? I bled on and off for a few days after the procedure, but nothing of concern occurred. This was about one month ago. Everyone Ive told, including my partner, therapist, friends, and sibling have all been completely supportive of me. Overall, I am so happy with my decision and I do not regret it at all. Im so happy to have my body back and feel like it actually belongs to me. I have no regrets and I know I made the right decision for myself, and I hope you do too.

Today I got as far as almost taking the first pill but backed out. I dont want an abortion. The doctor is now referring me to a different clinic because I refused twice. But I also cant have this baby. My partner and I broke up a couple of weeks ago (his fault). He blocks me and ignores me whenever he is in a mood. I dont want the pressure on him to find the money to support this baby. I also dont want to tie him to me. Im older (38, hes 34). He could find someone he wants and have a family, and as he lives in the US and im in the UK it would just be easier if he found someone else. Theres no hope of us getting back together because of how he is and what he does. So I would be a single mom. I also worry hed try to get custody.

But now I have let him know about the abortion and he thinks Ive done it. So I feel guilty that I havent and couldnt do it. He will be angry if he finds out I didnt do it, especially because I let him think I did. In my defence I was going to do it& and its better he thinks I have because then he will leave me alone instead of feeling forced to be around.

I tried but I just cant go through with it. I want the baby, I love the baby& but I had every intention of doing it.., I just couldnt.

my appointment was at 9:15 a.m. in new jersey. i live in pennsylvania, but am 20 minutes away. its legal here but they got me in sooner than any other clinic i inquired about. when i got there, there were two elderly people outside yelling at me to wait and come and talk to them. i ignored them and went in where i was greeted by a security guard. he was really nice and told me id probably be in and out because i was only getting local anestheticthis was true. i was out by 11:30. 

i started by signing a bunch of paperwork and paying partial of the payment. my entire procedure was $370. i eventually got called back and got my ultrasoundi was 5 weeks and 3 days. she couldnt see it with the external ultrasound, so i had to get another pregnancy test and a transvaginal. it was very uncomfortable but manageable. she also pricked my finger. i then went back to the waiting room where i was called again to speak to a nurse who asked about my medical history and if i was sure of my decision. she also gave me an 800 mg ibuprofen and some water. i spoke to another lady who dealt with the financial part and she told me about her own experience with an MA. she reassured me. 

i decided id go sit in my car and wait. i literally went and sat for 2 minutes before they called my phone to take me back in and change. they provided me with a gown, booties, and some kind of hair contraption. i waited after i changed for 5 minutes before i went in and sat on the table. i was shaking and panicking so bad. 

they were all really nice and reassured me. they also asked if i wanted to be put to sleep, and im scared of everything so i told them no. the procedure was literally 5 minutes. the worst part for me personally was the lidocaine shot. it pinched pretty bad and it also made me feel weird. my ears were ringing, my mouth was numb, and i felt fuzzy. i felt like i wanted to take a nap. they gave me a squeezy pig for my nerves and a lady also held my hand. i was freaking out and dissociating because i was so anxious. it was over in the blink of an eye. after they wheeled me back to the recovery room where i just had a panic attack. 

im not feeling any pain, just super anxious which i was before. im prone to severe anxiety. right now i feel super unreal and feel like im on the edge of psychosis from panicking, but other than that im okay. it was not worth worrying about and im so relieved.

Hello everyone,

I recently had a pretty traumatic abortion experience and I just wanted to share, get it off my chest, maybe find someone else who relates.

I took misoprostol twice, it failed the first time at 10 weeks (I still went through all the symptoms: cramps, shivers, diarrhea), but nothing came out, took it the second time at 12 weeks and again went through the same symptoms, started lightly bleeding, I went to a midwife that helps with abortions (its illegal in my country), I dont know what she did but she gave me a cervical exam to check if I was miscarrying correctly and I guess I got an infection from that.

I spent the next 10 days agonizing in pain, fever, uncontrollable shivering, migraines, nausea, vomitting, dizziness, I also had to lie to my family because they saw how sick I was and didnt understand why, wanted to take me to the ER. I tried my best to keep a brave face but I really thought I wanna gonna die and felt so weak&then one day I woke up with horrible pain (resembling contractions), I sat on the toilet agonizing in pain and feeling like I was gonna pass out (was with family so had to hide it as much as possible), then I finally felt the need to push and there it was, a fetus, I could see the eyes and hands/fingers, it was bigger than my hand and I had to help it come out because it was stuck. I flushed it because I couldnt keep looking at it. Then I felt even worse contractions, I hopped in the shower and ran some hot water, my bathroom looked like a crime scene from all the blood, I kept feeling contractions and pushed again, then something bigger than my palm came out (I think it was part of the placenta), I finally felt relief but I was still bleeding a lot.

It took everything in me to go to a gynecologist (I told her I had a miscarriage), she examined me and found some retained tissue and suggested she performs an aspiration with local anesthesia, or if I didnt wanna feel anything, I could opt for general anesthesia in a hospital. I knew that any retained tissue could give me trouble since I already had an infection and I didnt wanna risk going home like that, so I opted for the aspiration with local anesthesia. It wasnt painless, but it was nothing compared to what I had gone through, the needle for the local anesthesia was the worst part, the rest felt like really bad period cramps, it was over quickly and I finally felt relief. 

Its been almost a week now, my pregnancy symptoms are pretty much gone, I still feel very weak and my pelvic area still feels sore. I wanted this abortion but I still have conflicting feelings, I dont wanna be a mother and it was a stupid mistake that led to this pregnancy, I feel like myself again, I spent my pregnancy just being sick and miserable all the time, its a relief, I final feel in control of my body again, but I cant help feeling sad over my lost baby, and seeing it just made things worse. I dont regret my decision, I just wish I didnt have to make it at all.

Thats why I have a question about birth control (I will try everything not to be put in this situation again), I started taking the combination pill (which I bought right before finding out I was pregnant ironically), I took it 5 days after my abortion, but Im concerned that maybe I should let my cycle happen naturally so I expel everything that needs to be expelled. I stopped bleeding right after starting BC, my gynecologist told me theres no retained tissue left but I just wanna know if its okay to keep taking the pill or maybe have a natural cycle before starting it? If you have any info please let me know =O<ü

"772",772,"Waiting for my appointment, and feeling alone","2025-04-14",1744670924,"Waiting for my appointment, and feeling alone","Hi there, I (32 F in HI) and I'm about to have an abortion for the second time in my life. Not happy to say that... but I'm writing here to see if anyone else has struggled with getting an appointment that makes them wait waayyyy too long in this uncomfortable space? Back story: No desire to have kids, never have (even as a child myself), and nothing against people wanting this for themselves. It's just not for me. I'm in safe, healthy relationship with a person who shares similar views. He's supportive, but also doesn't fully get it because he's just not physically going through it like I am.  
I do live in a remote location, the nearest hospital/clinic (along with my GP) are about 45 minutes away, and when I saw them about a fractured bone in my foot a few months ago, I had no issue getting an X ray on the same day and getting it taken care of pretty much ASAP. When I called my insurance to see what to do and that I tested positive on two at home pregnancy tests and that I want to terminate as soon as possible, they told me I need a referral from my GP. I thought this was strange, but being that there is no planned parenthood in my location, I figured it would be better to try to go this route rather than booking a flight to another island. I went to my GP, it was no issue and she gave me a referral to the nearest clinic. Meanwhile, I'm fighting for my life and I'm barely able to keep water down/cancelling all work and personal obligations because I'm a depressed nauseous shell of a human, and then I finally get this clinic on the phone 3 days later, they're booked out for three weeks. While I was waiting to talk to them, I went to book an appointment at planned parenthood, and they were also booked out three weeks. WTF!?  
I called my GP office again, and they sent in a referral for a hospital two hours away. I waited about an hour for them to call me, but said ""F it"" and called them myself. They were able to take me in about a week sooner, and get this, they tell me that there was no referral needed to see them. I wish I knew this so I could've called them as soon as I tested positive. I also asked them for something, anything to help with the constant nausea and they prescribed me zofran, an anti nausea medication that has totally helped me eat real food again and feel some sort of normalcy (still totally nauseous, but not as constant and helping me stay hydrated). Why isn't this offered right away? Why didn't I know about this the first time I went through it?  
The first abortion I had, I was in a major city and had many options around me, but it was similar because it was during covid, and I also had to wait three weeks for it to happen. It was so slow moving and I was in absolute agony. I figured it was just because it was covid times, but I'm finding myself here again without that. Side note: I went on birth control after this first fiasco, but starting having suicidal ideations and had to go off of it... and here I am.

I just wonder, do doctors put women with unwanted pregnancies through this run around in the hopes that we might give up and change our mind or something? Is it just because this is Hawaii? Which I'm confused as it is a pretty blue state... I'm not comprehending why I can't just find out I'm pregnant and terminate the pregnancy in the same week. I understanding booking the surgery removal option in advance, but even just the pill route? Why can't I just get that right away? It feels like I'm being punished or on timeout. Maybe rightfully so, but I also think that people just make mistakes.

I'm in a space where I don't feel comfortable sharing this with anyone except for my therapist and my partner. I feel absolutely beaten down, low on myself, alone... It's excruciating. I'm 9 days in from when I found out (which was a couple weeks of feeling weird/missed period), about 7 weeks along, and 3 days away from my appointment that's two hours away. Each day I wake up absolutely hating myself and overwhelmed that I have to go through another day of existing like this. I hate to play victim here, but can anyone relate? I believe it's just a clump of cells and this was just a slip up, but my depressive mind creates other narratives that make me spiral. I feel hijacked, angry, extremely sad, but I feel like I'm losing myself. Thankfully my partner is here for me when he can be, but he gets to go on with his life and go to work/enjoy the things he likes to do. I'm not able to, even when I try to force it. Can anyone relate or have gone through something similar? In the meantime, I'm counting down the minutes until this appointment.","abortion",5,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jzcd6r/waiting_for_my_appointment_and_feeling_alone/"

I was/am an alcoholic ( have chilled out a lot compared to then though), and I knew i was in no shape to become a mom. 

The experience of being pregnant was simultaneously amazing and traumatizing. I felt like I knew I was meant to have a baby someday and I'd never really given much thought to having kids before then. On the other hand I was violently ill and oscillated between whether I really wanted to get an abortion. I ended up doing it and it was a painful, terrible experience. I went the medication route. The pain was not like anything I'd felt before. I felt like I was going in and out of consciousness in my bathtub. My partner at the time laid in our bed on reels while I laid on the floor in pain. 

Anyway, It's been two years. I want to have a baby so bad, and my current boyfriend and I plan on doing so in a few years. When I get drunk though, It always comes up. Whether Im around him or my friends, etc. I go on and on about pregnancy and how it will be an amazing experience to breast feed, and how I'm nonbinary and have always wanted either a breast reduction or to not have breasts but that it would take that experience away from me, and how sad I am that I had an abortion but that it was the right choice blah blah blah. 

I probably just need to go to therapy, but for now I just want to vent and talk about it with people who don't know me because clearly it is weighing on me, but it doesn't feel appropriate to talk about it with my friends or boyfriend anymore. Especially since my friends are till very close with my ex. 

Does anyone else have this kind of thing happen? Anything similar? I feel like a weirdo for it and ashamed and embarrassed. Also yeah, I should def quit drinking. I've been on the pat of fully stopping for a long time and it gets easier every time I try.

About 3 weeks ago I discovered I (21F) was pregnant. It felt like the end of my world. I've only been with my boyfriend for about 5 months and we had (and still have) what felt like a perfect relationship. I seriously couldn't ask for a better partner to have gone through this situation with. So we weighed out our options, went back and forth between abortion and following through with the pregnancy, but after many long conversations, and tears I came to the conclusion that I was not ready for motherhood just yet. I always thought prior to this situation if I ever got pregnant I would just have the baby until I actually was put in the position of being pregnant. So I ordered an abortion pill through the Hey Jane website (highly recommend) and the medicine and instructions were delivered to my house no more than 3 days later. The package also came with anti nausea medication and painkillers. I had pretty bad cramping throughout the process (felt like intense period cramps) and obviously a lot of mental baggage but other than that the actual experience of the abortion wasn't so scary. I thought I might regret it but I don't. As sad and hard as this situation has been, Its ultimately whats best for me. 

I just wanted to share my experience on here because I have found so much comfort throughout this process on this website, and really loved reading everyones experiences. Abortion is never easy and if anyone reading this needs any support or has any questions about my experience/ in general please just message me!

We want a family one day, but our timelines seem to be different&hes ready now and was excited to hear that Im pregnant, I ideally wanted to wait but was somewhat on the fence about timing.

I wanted to share my experience choosing between medical and surgical abortion. I know how overwhelming it can be, especially when youre already processing a lot. This is just my story.

---

**My Background:**  

I found out I was pregnant unexpectedly at 4 weeks and 6 days  despite taking two emergency contraceptives (i-pill). The shock was real. I was confused, scared, and didnt know where to start. But I knew I wanted to terminate the pregnancy safely.

After talking to a gynaecologist, I learned that I was eligible for both **medical** and **surgical** options.

---

**Heres how I broke it down:**

### **Medical Abortion (Abortion Pills)**
- Done up to 9 weeks of pregnancy.
- Two-step process: Mifepristone first, then Misoprostol after 2448 hours.
- Done at home (in many cases), which some people prefer for privacy.
- Can cause **heavy bleeding, cramps, nausea, diarrhoea**.
- Not always predictable  bleeding can last days or even weeks.
- Success rate: ~9598%. Around 25% may need surgical follow-up if incomplete.
-Inexpensive and affordable 
-Less invasive

### **Surgical Abortion (Vacuum Aspiration)**
- Typically done up to 1214 weeks.
- Quick procedure (510 minutes), done in a clinic under local or general anaesthesia and sedation
- Minimal bleeding post-procedure (for most).
- Lower chance of incomplete abortion  considered more final.
- Success rate: ~9899.5%.
-Expensive and slightly invasive 

---

**What I Chose &amp; Why:**  
I went with **surgical abortion**  mainly because:
- I wanted clarity and closure.
- I didnt want to deal with days of bleeding and waiting ( because I couldnt let my family know about it) 
- I have Rh-negative blood, so surgical was slightly safer in terms of managing that risk with an anti-D injection.
- I had the budget, access to a good clinic and a compassionate doctor.

I stayed in hospital for 5-6 hours in total, had the procedure, got my anti-D shot 2 hours later, and rested. Bleeding was minimal. Pain was manageable. Emotionally, it was a lot  but physically, it was clean, safe, and quick.

The ACTUAL process:

""Got admitted to the hospital

""Got an antibiotic injection, a cannula inserted, a regular checkup 

""Headed to OT, given sedation and general anaesthesia 

""I was asleep during the procedure; NO PAIN AT ALL

""Procedure was quick; total of 20-30 mins

""Woke up in recovery room feeling drowsy but pain free ; Felt fine within a few minutes 

""Got my lunch and Anti-D shot ; Was discharged 2 hours later

""Had minimal spotting for 3-4 hours with mild cramps 

""Got antibiotics medication to be taken at home. 

---

**If you're trying to choose, ask yourself:**

- Do I want to do this privately at home, or in a clinic under supervision?
- Am I okay with bleeding and cramping for several days?
- How far along am I?
- Do I have access to follow-up care if needed?
- Is there a reason (like Rh-negative blood or prior complications) that makes one safer than the other?
-What kind of budget do I have?

---

**Important tips:**
- Always consult a medical professional  theyll help guide you based on your health.
- Trust your gut. Dont choose based on internet horror stories. Everyones body is different.
- No choice is less brave or more natural. Its just about whats right for **you**.

---

If youre going through this, please know  youre not alone. I was terrified. I cried a lot. I questioned everything. But I came out okay. You will too.

It is not the end of the world! 

Feel free to ask anything or vent. Sending love and calm to anyone reading this.

Timeline of My Pregnancy and MA Journey
February 5  I took a pregnancy test and it came back positive.

From that moment, I knew I didnt want to continue the pregnancy. I started researching on Facebook and watching videos on TikTok. Eventually, I found a seller on Facebook who provided abortion pills. I ordered them immediately and waited for delivery, which took about 3-5 days.

February 18  The pills arrived. I messaged the seller, and she sent me a list of things to prepare for the procedure.

She advised me to take evening primrose oil to help soften my cervixtwo capsules inserted vaginally and one taken on an empty stomach.

She also recommended drinking black coffee (no sugar), pineapple juice, and ginger tea, as well as steaming for 20 minutes, walking, and even jumping 1,000 times. While I followed most of her instructions, I skipped the jumping.

First Attempt at MA
February 20, 10:00 PM  Took 3 Mifepristone.

12:00 AM  Inserted 3 Cytotec vaginally.
12:30 AM  Swallowed 3 Cytotec with water.

After that, I took the remaining pills:

6 Cytotec
8 Mifepristone
2 Meth
Total: 16 pills
The seller instructed me to:

Keep my legs raised for 2 hours.
Lie down and avoid peeing or pooping for 7 hours.
After the 7-hour procedure, I only had mild cramping (4/10 pain level) and very little bleedingjust light spotting with small clots. I knew, based on others' experiences, that my first attempt had failed.

I felt helpless, especially since I was struggling financially. I started researching again, and thankfully, I found this subreddit, which has been a huge help.

It has been one week since my abortion. I found out that I was pregnant at 21 weeks. I found out so late because I never got a regular period. I got pains and collapsed then admitted to the hospital. The hospital could not help with the abortion as 20 weeks was the cut off at this hospital and most clinics where I am living. 
This then triggered an anxiety attack that lasted a while, the doctors at the hospital then suggested that because its legal to have an abortion up until 24 weeks in the country, I could do it privately but at a cost. Only private practitioners will do it. About $5000 usd.
That started my search and I found a gynaecologist doctor that was willing to do it. So first tests at his office, then scheduled a date that required 2 night stay at a private hospital. Everything happened so fast. 
I did this all alone. As I moved to this country alone.
I had a boyfriend at the time but I broke up with him when I found out he gave me an STI and cheated. After that I found out I was pregnant. 
So a lot has happened. But back to the experience. 

I told no one what was happening so I spent the 2 nights alone in the hospital. First night the doctor performed what they call feticide and once I stopped hearing the heart beat of the baby on the ultrasound, the reality set in. Then the next morning early they started the misoprostol vaginally. 4 doses of 2 pills. Honestly I thought it would fail because I didnt have cramps or bleeding. 2 hours after the 4th dose the pain started and it was unbearable then finally my water broke but still no bleeding. I didnt know what to do but cry out because of the pain. The nurses were very supportive and that gave me the strength to go through this. 
Yesterday was my 1 week check up and Im healing well and doctor is happy with my recovery. Honestly Im just happy that Im getting better. But I will say I dont think Ill ever be feeling normal again. 
Till today I have not told anyone and its the first time after the abortion that Im talking about it again. I started lactating even though I was given hormone medication to stop it. Its a painful reminder. 
I still havent felt any sadness about the abortion or my break up with my boyfriend. I am happy I got an abortion because after telling him that he gave me a STI, he gaslit me and told me I must have cheated. It makes me feel that I did the right thing not to tell him about the pregnancy or abortion. 

I am sorry for such a long post and ranting on. This is the first time going through something like this and I have no one to talk to about it. 
 Im going through lots of emotions and I know somehow this has changed me in so many ways. I dont know what has changed just yet but Ill definitely find out as time moves on.

My pregnancy stopped growing and wasn't viable, though I was going the MA route regardless. 

I took the mifepristone yesterday at 16:00. no side effects.

15:00 today I took advil, tylenol and gravol

16:00 I took the miso. I placed 4 pills in my cheeks. 

I then fell asleep from the Gravol until 18:30. At that point I still had 2/4 pills intact in my cheeks. They were very soft and gummy, I swallowed them.

I fell back asleep until 20:30. At that point, I started having cramping. I would say it was a 7/10. I have had worse periods when I was younger. It definitely comes in waves. Please make sure you have a heating pad as it helps immensely. 

I went to the toilet and the bleeding had started, quite heavily but no clots. I started walking around as it felt like it was ""getting things going"". 

22:00 I smoked some weed for the pain then I got hungry and ate some snacks, as I hadn't eaten all day as I was very anxious prior. I also took more tylenol and advil.

23:00 diarrhea started. It's not too bad, passed a small clot. Still bleeding a lot. Bowel movements actually bring great relief to the pressure and cramping. 

I am fully prepared for things to take a turn for the worse, I prepared as though this would be the most physically painful thing I've gone through to date. Currently, it's not there.

I had a feeling and took a test that came up as positive. I had the pills for a medical abortion already at my house (I Have a 4 month old and wasnt sure what I was going to do when I found out I was pregnant with him &amp; never ended up using them). They werent expired yet so I took the mifepristone and the following day the 4 misoprostol. Absolutely nothing happened.

The next day, I contacted my doctor to get an HCG test which came back as 530 the first day and 1300 48 hours later. She said that I was pregnant and the levels were rising nicely. She estimated 4 weeks. 

So I ordered another set of pills online and yesterday at 3 pm I took the first one. Today at 4 I put 4 misoprostol under my tongue and let them dissolve. I m about to take another two at 7.

I had an abortion in Nov of 2023. The reasons for doing so are somewhat complicated, but at the time &amp; even for the following year I very much felt it was the right decision for me. My husband &amp; I had been married for 6 years at the time &amp; our marriage had been extremely rocky in recent years. When I found out I was pregnant, he had just moved back in with me after us being separated for an entire year &amp; him have another relationship the past 6 months. My biggest fear was that I could not trust him to stick around. I had a hard enough time taking care of myself while we were apart, I couldnt fathom going through that again with a child. I need more time for us to build our relationship back. We had talked about buying a house for years but it never worked out for us. It was important to me that we still did that because I had been in the same rental since we got married &amp; we could not grow there. The thought of bringing a baby home to this house that I dreaded being in scared me as well. My husband did not agree with me having an abortion &amp; he refused to be a part of the traveling &amp; payment for it. He was there when I was going through the pain, but didnt have much sympathy. After it was over, neither one of us brought it up. It was too sensitive of a subject. Even still, a few months later we bought &amp; renovated a house. I felt so much better about our relationship having made that step, but after only 6 months he was as angry as Id ever seen him for no apparent reason. He took his things &amp; left &amp; has since filed for divorce. This was right before Christmas last year. I was blindsided. He has since told me how angry it made him that I had an abortion &amp; I think it made him view me so differently. I felt I was justified in my decision at the time, but now I feel that I sealed our fate with that decision. I thought if he was going to leave me for having an abortion, it would be right away not an entire year later. Its not that I didnt want to have a family, but the timing just felt so wrong with us just coming back from being separated for a year. Now I feel that I ruined my chances of ever having a family &amp; my biggest fear is seeing him start a family with someone else. We had been together since I was 15 &amp; he truly was the loml. I could not even picture having a family with anyone else. I guess I am grieving the thought of what could have been.

I remember crying during the procedure...not because of the pain, paradoxically, but because of what I was loosing, but I carried on.

The 1-3 days after I was feeling fine but 4-6 days after had resurgence of significant pain (I ended up passing 2 large blood clots, which explains it) and the pain has since resolved. 

The one thing that has not improved at all with time is my persistent sadness. If ever idle, I feel a knot in my throat/chest and become tearful. I feel like I've done the worst thing in my life even though logically right now is not the time for me to have a child.

I know grieving is normal, but it hurts so much, interrupts my waking hours and keeps me from sleep.

I try to keep busy, cough the knots in my throat away and push on but the underlying sadness just doesn't go away.

I was shocked, scared, unsure what my partner would think and half of me wants to keep it. However at the moment as much as I want to be a mother,  I'm in a rental and after looking at all the costs, and stress. I know I couldn't have a child at this current time in my mid 20s.

I spoke to my partner and we agreed an abortion was the best scenario and that we will have a plan in the future.

He's very supportive and it was also in shock, but we know we will have kids.

He also knows this is my last abortion, i'm never having another one.

However as much as this is the right choice this isn't my first abortion. 

I'm feeling pre natal depression, scared sad and unworthy.

My partner knows this is my last abortion. It's mental toll that no one's speaks about that hurts us.

My last abortion was from a very toxic relationship when I was 20. And was the right choice.

This one also is the right choice at this time for me.

I want to be a mother, so this is one of the hardest decisions. I'm just past the window of a medical abortion and am booked in for a surgical. I'm terrified of needles, I scared I'll hear the vacuum and feel pain.

My question though is, can I still have a miscarriage naturally without an abortion as I'd almost rather feel the loss than deal with the surgery.

I know this sounds horrible, but I'm just feeling a lot.

Hello! I'm here to share my medical abortion (MA) experience because I promised myself I would share what I went through in hopes of helping other women who might be going through the same situation.

This will be a lengthy post, so please bear with me. :)

March 1: My expected menstruation date passed, but I wasnt too worried since my cycle can be delayed by up to 5-7 days. Even though I usually have a regular period, I wasnt anxious because I was busy with school and didnt have time to overthink whether I was pregnant or not. 

Fast forward to 2 weeks later. 

March 18: I started feeling anxious because my period still hadnt come. My boyfriend and I were at school and I was overthinking whether or not I'm really pregnant or if it's just due to stress so I asked my boyfriend to buy a pregnancy test so we could confirm if I was pregnant. We were at his room when we tested it, and two dark red lines appeared almost immediately. It was so fast that I didnt even have time to panic or cry. My boyfriend had already suspected that I might be pregnant days before I asked him to buy me a PT, so he had been researching WOW and WHW. I had also considered buying from local sellers because of the easier accessibility, but my boyfriend was firm in convincing me that it was better to wait a few weeks than risk my safety especially knowing that the pills from local sources could be fake. I listened to him, and after the pregnancy test confirmed the result, he immediately reached out to both organizations for help.

When I got home, I went to bed early, overwhelmed with anxiety about the whole situation. I dont know why, but it felt like I didnt even have the time to cry yet I still did. I cried out of fear and out of the uncertainty of what might happen to us.

March 19: The next day, I woke up early and I immediately checked my email. WOW replied at 1AM confirming that we were eligible for a medical abortion, so we quickly made a donation to them. We gave a smaller amount than what was requested because we werent financially well-off at the time, but we promised to contribute more when we could. Im incredibly grateful to WOW for allowing us access to safe and effective pills. At this point, I was 6 weeks and 5 days pregnant.

Payment Process: I donated via GoTyme Bank directly to their organization. 

March 20: I received an email from WOW informing me that they had already shipped the package, along with a tracking number. They mentioned that delivery could take 1 to 3 weeks. I couldnt help but cry. I was overwhelmed with happiness and hope knowing that I finally had a chance to access a safe medical abortion, even though its illegal in this country.

=æ=ÍPARCEL TRACKING UPDATES 

Here comes the most anxious part of the journey, the waiting time. We tracked the parcel using the 17Track Package Tracker app and the Packages app. I personally preferred the Packages app because the tracking updates appeared faster and it showed an expected date of arrival, which really helped ease my anxiety. And it turned out to be accurate, too. My boyfriend was so good at reassuring me, always telling me that I didnt need to worry and that the package would arrive safely. Mind you, there wasnt a single minute I didnt check the tracking apps.

From March 20 to 24, the package traveled from India and arrived in Singapore. Between March 25 to 29, it was in transit from Singapore to Manila. On April 3, it finally arrived in the Philippines and was sent for customs examination. On the same day, it was released from customs with a note: Import authorized, no taxes, no duties to be paid.
On April 4, the parcel was marked En route to Delivery Office. By April 7, it was received at the Delivery Office and that same day, it was delivered straight to our doorstep. I paid 112 pesos for the shipping fee. It took 18 days to reach me here in Metro Manila. I can say that it was the longest 18 days of my life. 

The waiting period was incredibly anxiety-inducing because I just wanted everything to be over as soon as possible. My symptoms kept getting worse. I had nausea, food aversion, bloating, gassy feeling, and fatigue. I tracked the package every day, seeking peace of mind. 

I was so relieved when the pills arrived before April 9, as we had no classes during that time, and it felt like the perfect moment to proceed.

My boyfriend and I also booked a hotel where we would carry out the MA. He was incredibly hands-on throughout the process, and I allowed him to take part as my companion during one of the most vulnerable times in our lives. Forever grateful to him. d

=ÌMA Experience 

Things I've Prepared: 
""6 tabs of 400 mg Advil
""2 tabs of 25 mg Bonamine
""1L Pocari Sweat 
""Snacks 
""Menstrual Pants
""Regular Napkins

April 8 (Day 1)
* 2:00 PM: I took Bonamine to help prevent nausea.
* 2:33 PM: I then took Mifepristone (Mife), and soon after, the nausea hit hard. I felt incredibly fatigued, with no energy to even eat or stand. My body demanded rest, so I slept for over 8 hours. 

April 9 (Day 2) When I woke up, I felt physically better but still anxious about what was ahead. Despite my feelings, I prayed for strength and guidance, finding comfort in my faith during such a vulnerable time. I ate a light meal to prepare myself for the process.

1:35 PM: I took 800 mg Advil and 25 mg Bonamine to manage any discomfort.

=FIRST DOSE 

2:42 PM: I took the first dose of Misoprostol (4 tablets sublingual). About 5 minutes later, I felt an urge to poop.

3:12 PM: The first dose was completed, but just a few minutes later, I vomited and felt intense cramps, along with watery stool. The pain was unbearable. Id never experienced anything like it before. I sat on the toilet for almost an hour, unable to move, while my body endured the worst pain Ive felt. Pain scale: 8/10.

3:15 PM: I noticed a flow down there so I checked. There's a brown discharge but no smell. 

3:48 PM, I was finally able to get back to bed, though the pain gradually started to ease. 

4:20 PM, the pain decreased to a 4/10, but chills set in. 

4:29 PM, I had no pain at all, and I managed to sleep, feeling completely exhausted.

5:00 PM: I woke up and felt a flow of blood. I felt relieved because I knew that this was the sign that the abortion is ongoing. I checked my maxipad and it was about 1/4 soaked.

5:20 PM: I went to the bathroom to pee and passed my first blood clot (around half an inch).

5:25 PM: Pain returned, this time at 5/10. I curled up in bed, trying different positions, and used my heat pad for relief which was very helpful. I also took another 200 mg Advil because I can't handle the pain. 

=SECOND DOSE 

5:42 PM: I was thinking of delaying my second dose because of the pain but my boyfriend insisted me to take it so I'm still on time. I agreed so I took my second dose of Misoprostol (2 tablets). 

5:49 PM, the pain escalated quickly to an 8/10. I was crying in bed while holding my boyfriend's hand. It was really painful. Then suddenly, I felt a strong gush of blood and rushed to the bathroom. I sat on the floor, trying to steady myself and to clearly see what would come out. I passed small clots, the placenta, and the fetus all at once. I was in shock. The fetus was recognizable. The pain vanished almost immediately, but I remained seated on the floor, trying to process the overwhelming reality of what had just happened. I stayed there for about 10 minutes, just crying from the deep emotional impact of the experience.

6:00 PM: The pain completely disappeared, though the bleeding continued. 

=THIRD DOSE 
8:42 PM: I took my third dose of Misoprostol (2 tablets). By this point, I had no more cramps, just continuous bleeding. I noticed a clot hanging in my vagina but left it alone, not wanting to rush things. I consulted with WOW, who advised me to take a fourth dose and try walking or gently pushing while using the toilet to help expel any remaining tissue.

9:30 PM: I ate dinner without feeling bloated and nauseated. Before, I couldn't finish 1 cup of rice but this night, I was able to finish almost 1 cup and ate snacks pa right after. My appetite went back that fast. I missed eating a lot. 

=FOURTH DOSE 
11:42 PM: I decided to still take the fourth dose of Misoprostol (2 tablets) to make sure I will expel all the remaining clots including the one that's hanging. I went to sleep afterward, though the bleeding continued. 

At 2:42 AM was supposedly my 5th dose but I decided not to take it since I felt like the miso doses that I took were already enough for my procedure. 

4:00 AM: I woke up to pee and found that the clot was still hanging. I gently pulled while pushing, and the clot came out easily. It was like a size of a golf ball. I was relieved and it felt like the last piece of the process had finally been completed. 

9:30 AM: I woke up feeling better and relieved. My appetite came back, and I was finally able to eat a lot. I was also able to walk without fatigue. I felt like I was slowly regaining my strength. I also noticed a slight decrease in breast tenderness. 

7:49 PM: As I'm writing this, I only have light bleeding like a normal menstrual period. I feel relieved and better. I am glad that my symptoms were gone and I'm able to go back to my old self again. 

I would say the anxiety of knowing you're pregnant and waiting for the pills to arrive was absolutely nerve-wracking. There were no nights that I come to reddit to read all the MA experiences of every woman out here. When the D-Day happened, all I was thinking was I need this to get done. The MA experience itself was painful and overwhelming so listen to your body and trust yourself. Don't forget to still look after yourself. Eat, rest, and hydrate. 

To all the women who are afraid and in doubt  tatagan niyo lang ang loob niyo. Kaya niyo 'to. You're stronger than you think. Whatever brought you to this point, know that you are doing what you believe is best for yourself and that alone takes courage.  =<;

The only thing was the pain, I had a vacuum procedure since it was too late for an abortion pill (which i understand is also as painful).

I was kinda ashamed and mostly I ended up feeling very stupid cause I was not pregnant anymore (chemical pregnancy so very early miscarriage). Recently, I have stopped taking birth control following a surgery, its been 3 weeks at least and still no bleeding (which is odd cause i usually bleed in the two days after not the taking birth control) Its too early for me to take an accurate test, and I cannot calculate my menstrual cycles anymore since Im on icontraception anyway. Im a very anxious person and well after experiencing two different types of unwanted pregnancy Im just even more terrified to discover Im pregnant again and have to get AGAIN an abortion and be ashamed of myself for being so stupid repetitively.

After a long 12 hours, I can finally share Part 2 of my MA journey.

Im writing this post just after sharing my failed MA experience last month. I hope my story can help others going through the same situation.

# How I Found WoW

After my first failed MA using pills from a local seller in the Philippines, I spent weeks researching and eventually learned about Women on Web (WoW). By that time, I was already 9 weeks pregnanttwo weeks had passed since my failed attempt.

I immediately filled out the online consultation form, and fortunately, my request was approved. Since I was nearing 10 weeks, they prioritized shipping my medication. I was beyond gratefulit felt like the universe was guiding me through this.

The only challenge was the donation. I was struggling financially, so I requested to donate once I was able. They understood my situation, and I managed to contribute ¬24 (±1,500)the most I could afford at the time. I was deeply touched that an organization like this exists, offering support without judgment.

# Receiving the Pills

WoW shipped the package and provided me with tracking information. After 9 days, I received my medication through PhilPost.

# Timeline of My MA

# March 22

* **8:00 AM**  Ate breakfast.
* **9:00 AM**  Took 1 Mifepristone. No side effects. Went about my day as usual.

# March 23

* **8:00 AM**  Ate breakfast.
* **9:00 AM**  Took Paracetamol (for pain relief) and Bonamine (for nausea).
* **10:00 AM**  Placed 4 Misoprostol pills under my tongue and held them for 30 minutes.
* **10:30 AM**  Swallowed the remaining pills. No bleeding or contractions yet, so I decided to rest and set my alarm for the next dose.
* **1:00 PM**  Took the second dose of 2 Misoprostol pills (same method).
* **1:30 PM**  Swallowed the remaining pills.
   * Still no bleeding, but I felt light contractions (pain level: 2/10). I started to worry because many people feel effects sooner, but I reassured myself that at least I was feeling something. I tried to sleep and managed to doze off.
* **3:00 PM**  Woke up with sharp pelvic pain, and as soon as I stood up, I felt a sudden gush of blood. I rushed to the bathroom.
* **3:33 PM**  Passed a large clot. My pad was soaked with blood, and contractions intensified (pain level: 6/10).
* **3:45 PM**  Passed another whitish-gray clot with an umbilical cord, but I didnt see a fetus. I started worrying.
* **4:00 PM**  Took the third dose of 2 Misoprostol pills under my tongue.
* **4:30 PM**  Swallowed the remaining pills. I rested for a bit, still feeling mild cramps on and off.
* **9:00 PM**  Took the fourth dose of 2 Misoprostol pills, but this time, I wasnt able to hold them in for the full 30 minutesonly about 10 minutesbefore swallowing the rest with a glass of water. After this, only small clots came out, and my cramps gradually became milder. My bleeding continued but resembled a normal period.

# March 24

* **4:00 AM**  Woke up needing to pee and change my pad. Passed another small clot with a whitish-gray color, but still no visible fetus.

# Post-MA Thoughts

Today is my first day post-MA. The pregnancy symptoms that Ive noticed are gone include nauseaI no longer gag when smelling strong scents like bath soap or detergent.

Physically, I feel lighter, but mentally, Im anxious. Since I was 11 weeks along, I expected to pass a visible fetus, but I didnt. This makes me wonder:

* Could my pregnancy have stopped growing after my failed first MA?

I will continue monitoring my symptoms and update soon.

Thank you to everyone interested in my MA journeyI hope this helps others in similar situations. =","abortion",3,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jirfyz/my_ma_journey_at_11_weeks_pt_2/"

I found out around 10 days ago I was pregnant, for my own reasons I decided not to continue. I already have a 1 year old and Im not mentally in the right place at the moment. 

Im from the UK so I contacted BPAS who passed me to a local hospital to discuss my options, I initially wanted an SA but the wait was too long and I wasnt willing. 

On Tuesday I arrived at the clinic and had my blood done due to low iron, then she proceeded to ask me if I was sure then gave me the mifepristone. 

Once I got home I started bleeding a fair bit, and had cramps. I did call to ask if this was normal and she stated in some cases it can happen, possibly that my body was beginning to do it naturally. 

48 hours later I took the misoprostol ( yesterday morning). From this point on I had minor bleeding and minimal pain, to the point just thought it wasnt working for me. And this proceeded until 7pm tonight, Ive now began having quite a heavy flow passing clots but again, the pain is minimal and Im able to take care of my son and do my day to day activities with taking just some ibuprofen and having a hot water bottle. 

I do think its going to continue to take a couple of days, so Im happy to keep updating!

Im 21, about to graduate college, and I recently had an abortion. It was one of the hardest decisions Ive ever had to make, and now that its done, I feel overwhelmed with guilt and sadness.

Ive always wanted to be a mom. I love kids. Ive dreamed of having a family for as long as I can remember. But when I found out I was pregnant, everything hit me all at once. Im graduating soon, I dont have a job lined up yet, and Ill be moving back in with my parents.

Ive always been pro-choice and I still believe in the right to choose, but I didnt expect this much grief. I feel like I lost a piece of myself, and the what ifs keep haunting me. What if I could have made it work? What if I just gave it more time?

So I never thought I would end up here but sometimes life has other plans  I found out I was pregnant three days ago and my anxiety has been at an all-time high. Im just a little over 5 weeks and best decision for my future is to go through with an abortion.

Im leaning toward SA since reading about the pain and side effects that the pills can cause on this sub.

We had done unprotected intercourse one time and then I took a plan b right after. I thought I was for sure in the clear but of course there's always a risk. At first when I found out I was pregnant, I was in shock and excited. I told my husband who was also in shock and he asked ""what are we going to do""? This is the way I felt as well. Thinking of myself as a mother right now and giving up my freedom and my current life seemed absolutely depressing to me. He told me that he goes both ways on pros/cons of an MA or keeping the baby and supports any decision I decide to make. He said we will make it work regardless. I just don't know now that it's sinked in, if I'm ready to be a mom right now. I definitely want kids in the future but it just feels like poor timing and makes me incredibly sad thinking about it. We told our parents we were pregnant out of pure shock at first and I think if I did the MA, we'd have to tell them we had a miscarriage. I am at a complete loss and feel I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place.

Old 7 week SA experience. *Sedation did not work*","**This will be a long post** Background: I am a married for 15 years, 37 year old mom of 3 kids, the youngest being 7 &amp; I'm an RN. I also want to preface this by saying that I was always pro-life and this entire experience had completely flipped my mind and perception of things. Anyways, my periods are pretty typical and 28-30 day cycles. My period always comes within a week or 2 of it's designated time. Well at the end of March, I began feeling yucky- more bloated than normal, tired, nausea, weird breaking out, sore boobs (which I always get prior to my period). I didn't really think much of it because lots of this things happen right before my period. But I took a test anyways just to ease my mind. Sure enough it was *instantly* positive. I called my husband in the bathroom and showed him and immediately he was like, ""this is not good!"" I said ""I know..."" and I started crying. As I mentioned, with 3 kids all in sports and activities, I cannot imagine adding a 4th to the mix. My daughter has prom at the end of the month (lotsa expenses for that), we are barely scraping by. I just started my online Bachelors program, I just got a great job almost a year ago. I continued to think about how expensive baby supplies are - diapers, formula, wipes, clothes, doctor visits, etc. we literally have nothing left from out other kids so it would be starting over. Not to mention, I could not imagine going through another pregnancy and birth. All 3 of my kids were vaginal births the only one that I received an epidural with was the first one. I took another test the next day to make sure, it was immediately positive as well. I was approx 5.5 weeks and my husband and I went back and fourth about what the right choice was. I felt terrible about either choice. The next day, I found many reputable sources for the medication abortion and ordered through ""the MAP- Cambridge Reproductive Health Consultants"". I paid 75$ and they came 5 days later. I had planned on taking the first one on Saturday and then the Miso Saturday. So I could be home and not miss work. My husband was running the kids to all of their travel basketball things so I would mainly be alone. My younger sister had had a medical abortion and a surgical abortion so I consulted with her and she assured me about the way it would go. I researched and researched for 7 hours, looking at the terrifying side effects to or potential outcomes of the pills and I carried the mifepristone around for 7 hours almost taking it and then it. I just couldn't do it. I decided that I would rather do the surgical. This was so I could be monitored by healthcare professionals. I have a history of low iron so I worried about that. I scheduled at a planned parenthood that was 1.5 hours away and at this point I was approx. 7 weeks,(Yesterday). I was extremely anxious and nervous about this entire situation and what would happen. I read countless stories from other women on Reddit who went through the same thing- which was very helpful and allowed me the courage to do it and also gave me an idea as to what to expect. I told my boss I was sick and wouldn't be in &amp; sent my kids off to school. My husband took me to the PP. when I arrived I felt so much anxiety. We walked in and got checked in and waited. 5 mins later we went to the next floor and checked in up there where I provided intake questions, was weighed and had vitals done. Then I waited some more before having a transvaginal US. It was determined that I was 6weeks and 6 days so I was pretty much spot on with my guess of 7 weeks. Then I waited some more before the education person talked to us about the process and pain management options. I chose the highest level they offered which they called ""moderate sedation"". This consisted of Ketamine, Versed, and Fentanyl- I was advised that this would be the best option since I had a ride and was also advised that it would work well. I was told that so many people fall asleep during the procedure but some don't- either way it would make it easier. So I got my IV and basically went right in to the ""procedure room"". It was cold as fuck and the nurse in there was cold too. She was super generic acting and seemed like she could care less. I undressed from the waist down and put a pad in my underwear and left them on a chair as instructed. I then laid flat on the table and waited. I began crying and the nurse asked me what was wrong- I told her I was scared of the pain. She said- well that's up to you and how you react. I asked if the medication I was getting would help at all and she said, it will make you feel loopy but you will still feel. I was petrified! I managed to calm myself down without the help of her and before I knew it, the entire team was in there which was about 4 people. The physician was a female who introduced herself and then I was administered the medication through my IV. They immediately got started. Put my legs up in the holders and I did begin to feel fuzzy and loopy. I felt like I was drunk. The Lidocaine shots went into my cervix and I felt it. It was sharp. And immediately after that- it continued to get worse. The speculum hurt, the dialation hurt, I could feel literally everything. I was crying in pain I was begging for more meds but they couldn't give me any. It was so painful. I then could feel the blood coming out of me and the physician asked me if I had bleed a lot with my previous births. I said, ""I had bled but was never informed it was a lot"". She then had to give me some medication to help the uterus contract more and help it to stop bleeding. She also manually massaged my uterus. All of this shit hurt bad. Then they did the Transvaginal ultrasound to make sure everything was out. And it was done. It was terrible. I was able to get up and get dressed myself and walk back to the recovery room just fine. I barely felt like I had just received a drug cocktail. I sat with my husband with a heating pad and they monitored me for about 15-20 mins and then I left. They said a follow up was not necessary and that everything was fine. My husband took me to get burgers and ice cream, then took me home and I laid around the rest of the day with my heating pad. Today I'm going to work from home, and I feel much better. I am relieved that it's over and I'm not pregnant anymore. Thinking back, It feels like the was half blacked out drunk remember bits and pieces. It's weird. I am thankful that this procedure exists for women, no matter the reason. I also was told that my uterus retroverted- which can make things more difficult. I do not want to go through that again but if I had to, I would. I would try to find a place that offers general anesthesia next time- this is just my experience. I don't think my experience is the norm and I hate that this is the type of experience I had. But it's over now and I can begin to heal. I wish any and all of you the best of luck and would like to remind you to stay positive and try to remember it's a quick process regardless of how much it may hurt.

However, despite feeling relief and being more than comfortable in my decision to terminate, Ive been feeling almost like I lost something that I actually wanted? Even though there was nothing in my life that has ever distressed me and terrified me as bad as being pregnant did, I still have this unshakeable feeling that I lost something and I have almost an obsessive compulsive thought that I did something wrong and will soon regret it. But logically I dont regret it at all and am overall very relieved and comfortable with my decision? Is this because of my hormones? Will it begin to subside as my body recovers from the pregnancy? 

**EDIT TO ADD:**
Ive been receiving a lot of backlash from my parents for my decision to terminate, and my mother keeps trying to instill it in me that I will regret my decision or that I have mentally damaged myself for life so also maybe consistently hearing that mixed with being overly hormonal?

This is a complete shock. It had taken multiple rounds of IVF to conceive my daughter four years ago; my doctors and I thought I would never conceive again, and I was fine with that. I'm tired. I don't have the energy or time for another baby, and I know that 90 percent of the care would fall to me, and I would have less time and resources for the daughter I already have. My husband and I are not in a good place maritally. If he were were excited about this pregnancy I might be able to get excited too, but the source of our marital tension revolves around him being unhappy living a ""suburban dad"" life, and I'm terrified that another baby would only make that worse.  I would rather us put all of our effort into repairing the little family we have.

  
But my daughter is in the age where she regularly asks for a sibling. Where she sees how all of her friends have siblings. Where I worry about her being left alone in the world after I die. Before when she's asked for a sibling I felt okay with myself telling her honestly, sweetheart, mommy's body just can't make any more babies -- I'm so lucky to have you! But now there's this 1 in a million event happened, and I'm worried that if I terminate the pregnancy I'll spend the rest of my life knowing that was a lie: I could have given her a sibling, and I chose not too.

I feel paralyzed and scared and I'm looking for some support.

My aunt (who I live with) doesnt know Im pregnant so its really hard keeping it a secret with me being nauseous, throwing up, and the smells bothering me. Shes also pregnant which makes getting an abortion even harder for me. Ill be reminded of what couldve been and it makes me sad.

If I go through with it, the father is coming with me. He offered to come because they told me I need someone to be there with me. Every time I think about the abortion though, I literally cry and choke up. He keeps trying to make sure Im ok but Im not.

I know hes right about us not being ready but I just cant believe my 1st pregnancy will end in abortion. Its not what I ever imagined for myself.

He called me boring for not letting him. He had ejaculated in me before, but I put a stop to that and insisted on using condoms again because I knew pregnancy was a real possibility.

Now Im 8 weeks pregnant.

As soon as I found out, I told himalso letting him know that  I was considering keeping the baby. His response? He didnt want any part of it. He said he didnt want another child, accused me of ruining his life, and asked why Id want to keep a baby by a man who doesnt want it and what exactly was i gonna tell people when they ask about the father. That cut deep, especially since just a few days earlier, he was desperate to see me.

The moment things got real, he vanished.

Later, I found out through TikTok that hes still in a relationship with his child mother the same woman he told me he was no longer involved with. When I confronted him, he lied and said the woman in the videos was his sister. Still lying, even though I know the truth.

Ive decided to go through with the abortionnot because I want tobut because I dont want any more drama. Im just emotionally drained.

I am writing on behalf of a dear close relation.  
B and J have been together for 4 years. They are in their mid-20s and live together. They have a fine relationship in everyday life, and they have no desire for children, as they are students.

B has had unstable menstrual periods, so they were carefully with protection and as far as possible with timing. J had talked months before that they absolutely should not have children now. He has never shown interest in children or the family's children.

This winter, B unfortunately became pregnant. J was almost unnaturally happy and wanted to keep the child. J wanted to tell everyone about the pregnancy, while B was in doubt and wanted them to think it over and go to the doctor + that some time will pass. J was so excited and immediately told the family, they were happy and congratulated. All the while, B became more and more upset. The reason was both that she was in the middle of her studies, her health was failing, and at the same time they had had a period of troubles in their relationship. B decided that they should wait to have children and want an abortion. J became disappointed and almost angry and upset. He rejected B and did not support the decision.

It ended with a medical abortion, where J goes with her, but choose to stay in the waiting room.

B was alone, and it was difficult. J blame B for crushing his dream and says that she is mean and did not take him into account - and that it was now embarrassing to tell people that they were not going to have a child anyway. B was upset about the whole process, his reaction and lack of participation. It culminated in J wanting oral sex when they got home from the hospital after the abortion.

Now everyday life is back, but there are some cracks in the relationship from B's side. Both his reaction, the lack of support but mostly the humiliating fact that she satisfied him with a BJ a few hours after the abortion.

"858",858,"2 Year Post-Abortion Update!","2025-03-22",1742652014,"2 Year Post-Abortion Update!","So, I feel like updates like these arent really ever made. People used to ask me, Do you ever regret it? And Im sure people wonder what its like afterwards, way afterwards. I made a post after my SA two years ago my abortion was an incredible experience, freed me from the torturous hellish nine weeks that was pregnancy. But when the adrenaline from getting my body back &amp; my hope back faded, how did I feel?

Every time I have an amazing day, a wonderful day with friends or family or just enjoying the weather, a day when I wake up when I want to &amp; do whatever I like, I think to myself, Thank God I dont have kids. Im so glad I got my abortion. And every time I have an awful day, stress &amp; financial worries &amp; health worries &amp; my future seems unsteady, I think to myself, Thank God I dont have kids. Im so glad I got my abortion. It really is a win-win. Life could always, always be worse. I could be pregnant, &amp; through any suffering Ive ever been through that was the worst of it. After that time of agony I survived, Im not scared of anything anymore except being pregnant again. 

Do I ever wonder? Not often, but occasionally. But everyone wonders about what their kids would be like if they had them. I would wonder even before the pregnancy or abortion. So I dont think thats very emblematic of anything, you know? Its not that deep. Do I ever wish I wouldnt have? Never. Not once, personally. I regret absolutely nothing. Expect for maybe, you know, not taking birth control in the first place.

I have mom friends who are young adults like me, some even a few years younger, who went from expecting- almost anticipating, in a sick way- my nonexistent grief post-abortion, to lamenting about their lost youth, their grief. I wish I was a normal 23 year old. You made the right choice. I wish I wouldve gotten an abortion the first time. I definitely shouldnt have had them so young. I shouldve never trusted him. I fucked up. I hear it from both sides, the mothers &amp; fathers too. Every single friend of mine who has children has had some form of regret over it. Its something I hate to hear for them, &amp; for their kids, who are wonderful &amp; adorable. But having a child doesnt make you want to be a parent, birth isnt some divine ritual that grants you maternal drive. I just wish we could collectively take off the rose colored glasses regarding parenthood. There would be a lot more happy people &amp; happy kids if they really knew what they were getting into. 

The one thing I fear, like I said, is being pregnant again. Ever since I became pregnant the first time, its a real fear. I mean, it was always a fear of mine, but you dont know how awful it is until it really happens to you. I had no idea how completely justified my fear was until. Pregnancy was traumatizing. I take my birth control religiously, but I dont trust it for a second. Ill take Plan B along with my birth control &amp; still be afraid. Ill take multiple Plan Bs in a month, in a week if I have to. I try to remember how I felt what the first signs were. I always have the clinics page on my tab, just in case. When I was pregnant I found out at 4 weeks &amp; had to wait 9 weeks for my abortion. I wouldnt be so afraid if I didnt have to wait so long, that agony, that misery, nonstop for days &amp; weeks it haunts me. Ill take the pill if, God forbid, that affliction possesses me once again. I wouldnt have to wait as long. I could care less about the pain compared to the months of torture I now know. Unless a day comes when I can get my forsaken uterus removed, or ovaries, or all of it for all I care I think Ill be afraid forever. If there was a way to become infertile I would take it. Every time Im a little nauseous, I get flashbacks. If I get any strange pain or cramp in my stomach, I get paranoid. If my period starts off slow, I start to panic, thinking back to the pitiful spotting. I wish for waves of blood. Sometimes I think I would be okay with bleeding every single day for the rest of my life with the comfort of knowing I am definitely not pregnant. 

So! This is how I feel after my abortion, two years later. Mostly this is how I feel about my pregnancy two years later, though. Because theres not as much to say about my abortion that I hadnt already gushed over in my first post I loved it. It was life saving. It was amazing. The wait was so long, too long, but the results were instantaneous &amp; my gratitude for that procedure never waned. I love to talk about it. I never wish for a timeline in which it never happened. When I think about it, I get so happy. Its a wonderful memory. I think abortion is an answered prayer from centuries of scared women wishing they had a safe way out. Its a gift from God. 
The only negative thing that lingers from that time is my fear of being pregnant again. I know who to call &amp; how much to pay, but theres just no cure for any of those symptoms, and nothing makes that time of waiting go faster. Even through my miserable nine week haze I now still remember viscerally every uniquely awful thing it did to me. I try to comfort myself with the thought that, you know, I made it through the first time. 
I just dont ever want it to happen again.

So, I wanted to share my personal experience to help others know what to expect. While every clinic may have slight differences, I hope this gives you a general idea of what the process looks like.

Booking the Appointment

I found out I was seven weeks pregnant and booked an appointment at a womens clinic the following week. The online form was simpleit asked for my name, estimated weeks of pregnancy, and the reason for my visit.

The next day, I received a pre-appointment questionnaire about my medical history. It included questions like:
	""	Does cancer run in your family?
	""	Are you anemic?
	""	Have you had an abortion before?

At the end, it asked for my insurance information. Since I dont have insurance, I just skipped that part, and it was totally fine. After submitting the questionnaire, I only received basic reminders via text to bring my ID and my appointment details.

Arriving at the Clinic

On the day of my appointment, my boyfriend came with me. The waiting room was a decent size with chairs and a small TV. There were other people theresome in similar situationswhich made me feel a little less alone.

I was running late (my appointment was at 8 AM, and I got there at 8:20), but when I checked in, the receptionist was really nice. She handed me a clipboard to confirm my name, address, and other basic info. She also asked for my insurance card. I gave her an expired one, not knowing if it was still valid, but she reassured me they would check.

After signing the forms, I only waited about four minutes before they called me back.

The First Consultation

At this point, my boyfriend wasnt allowed to come with me, which I wasnt expecting. Just a heads-upsince it was a womens clinic, they didnt allow male partners in the back for privacy reasons.

I was taken to a smaller room where a staff member asked me questions on a computer. Up until this point, everyone had been really kind, but this particular person (who seemed around 25) had a bit of an attitude. Nothing majorjust her vibe.

Since my insurance didnt go through, I had to apply for pregnancy coverage through Covered California, which helps uninsured women with pregnancy-related costs. She asked about my income, had me sign a few papers, and explained what was going to happen next.

Medical Tests &amp; Paperwork

After the paperwork, I gave a urine sample and was sent to a second waiting room. There were pamphlets about birth control, and within about five minutes, another staff member called me back.

The next step was a quick anemia test. The nurse pricked my finger, took a drop of blood, and put a bandaid on itit was so fast that I barely felt it. She was super sweet and made casual conversation, which helped me feel more at ease.

The Ultrasound &amp; Receiving the Pills

After that, she walked me over to the ultrasound room. This part made me a little nervous, but I sat and waited, taking in the moment by myself. Within minutes, a woman came in and asked me to lower my pants and lift my shirt. It wasnt anything crazyshe just applied the cold gel and checked to see how far along I was.

They didnt show me the ultrasound, but I could see images printing. I personally didnt ask to see them, but Im sure if you did, they would let you. That was just my personal preference. The whole ultrasound took about 5-8 minutes. Once she confirmed that I was under 11 weeks (which meant I could take the pills instead of needing a surgical procedure), she left to get the doctor.

I waited about 10 minutes before the doctor came in with the pills and explained how to take them. I took the first pill in-office, which stops the embryo from growing. Then she explained that the second set of pills should be taken the next morning. I was instructed to place two pills on the right side of my cheek and two on the left side, letting them dissolve naturally.

She also prescribed me 800mg ibuprofen for pain and another medication for nausea, which I could pick up at my local Target. The whole process was fast and straightforward. Most of the staff acted like this was a routine thing they had done a million times before, and honestly, I was okay with that. It did feel a little rushed, but at the same time, I just wanted to get out and be with my boyfriend again.

I was in and out within an hour. When I went back outside, they told me I was good to go. As of now, I believe the insurance covered the cost since I wasnt asked for any payment, but Ill confirm when I go to my second appointment on Friday.

The First Day After Taking the First Pill

Since I took the first pill at the clinic, I was worried Id start feeling symptoms right away, but honestly, I felt fine. The only minor side effect I noticed was that I got warm really easilylike my body temperature was just a little higher than normalbut other than that, the first day felt completely normal.

Emotionally, though, I felt very sensitive. I just wanted to be babied all day. If my boyfriend brought up anything stressfulwhether it was work, home, or just life in generalI found myself extra emotional because I knew that by the next morning, my body would be going through a big change. I was mentally preparing for the worst, but overall, the first day was more about anticipation than anything physical. I took it easy and rested.

Taking the Second Set of Pills &amp; Symptoms

The next morning at 9:30 AM, I took the four pills as instructed. It took almost 40 minutes for them to fully dissolve.

Within an hour, I started feeling cramping and heavy bleeding. The first couple of trips to the bathroom, I passed large clots, but it was nothing more than a very heavy period. The clotting was just like a regular period, except larger, and they passed fairly quickly.

I did have mild cramping, but it wasnt nearly as bad as I had anticipated. I know some people experience severe cramping, but for me, it was manageablenothing worse than a heavy period. After the first three hours, the bleeding significantly slowed down.

I stayed in bed for a few more hours with a heating pad, drifting in and out of sleep. I had enough energy to go for a short drive, and while the cramps came and went, I wasnt completely out of commission. By 6 PM, I had been in bed all day, so I got up, made myself food, and went on a therapy drive to listen to music.

By the second day, I was able to go to Target and walk around, though I took it easy. I even went to work for my five-hour shift. Now, on day three, I dont feel any side effects, and my flow is relatively light. Yesterday, I still had some clots when I went to the bathroom, but nothing alarming.

I know there are a lot of horror stories online, but I wanted to share that for me, it was very manageable. Nobody talks about the cases where the pill works smoothly and the experience is fairly calm. I just hope this helps other girls who are doing their research and feeling anxious.

Im 21, and this was my first time navigating something like this on my own. If I can do it, you can too. You are not alone, and this process is much less scary than your mind might make it out to be. Trust your body, let the pill do what its prescribed to do, and take it one step at a time.","abortion",5,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jdwtgc/my_experience_with_the_termination_process_a/"

I have 10 month old twin boys who I conceived spontaneously after a miscarriage with my husband. I was elated to have gotten pregnant at all after a PCOS diagnosis. I wanted them so very badly. The pregnancy was brutal, birth was brutal, postpartum has been brutal mentally and physically, but I wouldnt change it for the world. I love my sons.

I found out last week I am pregnant again, which was a shock. It was unplanned, but not necessarily unwanted. I have wanted a 3rd. I ended up getting an early scan today at 5 weeks because Ive been having pretty concerning left sided pain, and I was worried it was maybe an ectopic pregnancy. Imagine my surprise (total grief and despair are better words) when they found 2 gestational sacks in my uterus.

I cannot do it again. Even if I wanted to, which I do not, I cannot afford to have 4 children. 3 was going to be tight. We have plans to sell an investment property we own because we need to buy a new house for extra room. We have debt we are trying to pay off. I cannot be a stay at home mom, so I would have to pay for childcare for 4 babies. All this to say, I just cant imagine a world where this works out.

I am pro abortion. My husband and I had one when I was a teenager. Even being pro abortion and having one in the past, I have always carried guilt with me over having one, especially after my subsequent pregnancy many years later resulted in a miscarriage. It felt like I was being punished. I know I wasnt.

I dont know what to do. Terminate one? Both? Is it even really an option? I live in Indiana which is very anti abortion. Id have to go to Chicago. Id have to meet with an MFM who is willing to even do it, as I think its controversial.

I didnt have the money to go to a proper clinic, so I tried using local, illegal pillsbut they didnt work. By the time I discovered Women on Web, I was already 7 weeks and 6 days. I placed my order, and the package arrived after 2 weeks and 3 days, just before Holy Week.

1st day
7:17 PM  I took the first Mifepristone tablet.

2nd day
6:00 PM  Took paracetamol since Im allergic to ibuprofen. I also bought Charmee menstrual pants in preparation.

7:20 PM  Took four 200mcg Misoprostol pills and let them melt under my tongue for 30 minutes before swallowing the remains.

7:40 PM  The cramping started off gradually, but the pain quickly became intense. I also had really bad back pain and a strong pooping sensation. I used a warm compress to ease the pain in my abdomen and back.

7:45 PM  The pain was so bad that I could barely stand. I forced myself to the bathroom and had a bowel movement. Thats when I saw the first sign of blood.

8:00 PM  I felt so sleepy, but the pain was too intense to rest properly. I tried to regulate my breathing to manage the cramps, which came in wavesbearable at first, then suddenly unbearable. I eventually managed to take a short nap.

9:00 PM  I woke up feeling a bit better, but I was worried because I was still only bleeding a little.

9:10 PM  Right after I woke up, I noticed I was having an allergic reaction. There were hives near my armpits, my hands and face were itchy, and my face started to swell slightly with a few more hives appearing. I took two 20mg Bilastine tablets, and thankfully the reaction began to subside.

9:40 PM  Out of nowhere, the cramps hit really hard again. I started pushing, and suddenly there was a huge gush of blood. My menstrual pants were soaked.

9:45 PM  The fetus came out. My baby already had fully formed hands, feet, and fingers. Thats when everything hit me emotionallyI broke down and cried, all while still in pain.

10:00 PM  More tissue came out.

11:00 PM  I still had some pain and kept pushing whenever it got worse. Eventually, the placenta came out. It was big and I was honestly shocked. I cleaned myself up and noticed the cramps had lessened. There was still some bleeding, but it was more manageable.

2:00 AM  I was finally able to sleep. The pain was still there, but it was bearable by then.

Im still processing everything that happened. Ive been crying a lotphysically, emotionally, its a lot to carry. But Im incredibly thankful to my partner who stayed by my side throughout the entire process. To anyone going through something similar, please know youre not alone.

I am 33 and currently 22 weeks pregnant with twin boys. I have always wanted a family, so when i found out about this pregnancy I decided to keep them. The father and I dated for about 2 months and he broke up with me before i found out the pregnancy (kinda broke up because he didn't want kids). when he found out the news about the pregnancy, he actually came around and decided that this is actually what he wants. He was more excited about the pregnancy than me, when he decided to stay he told his family, friends, reading books, etc. I on the other hand was more reserved due to the fact that i'm in the middle of a separation/divorce, so i had to be careful what information i can share. He was initially very involved, constantly checking in with the baby sizes, etc. 

Soon we started fighting about some stuff related to looking for a house together, those escalated, turned into more fights, and he slowly withdrew affection for me. What bothered me the most is that he would run away after fighting (go back to his house), and i just really wanted to have someone with me throughout the pregnancy, because i didn't want to be alone. Whenever he leaves after a fight it just leaves me in a dark headspace into spiraling thinking that i'd be doing this alone. Throughout all of this he never wavered on the fact that he wanted to be a father to the twins more than anything. However, i started slowly withdrawing because i just didn't feel safe and didn't want to feel abandoned again when we get into arguments. I had decided to get an abortion (so maybe subconsciously i was pushing him away), which he says is not what he wants, but he doesn't have a say in the matter because it is my body. He walked out 2 days ago after another flight, and I am questioning everything now and if this was the wrong choice? I don't know if there are anything we can do now to repair all the damage that has been done, i don't have any support so i'm not able to do this on my own, which is why i wanted to abort. the late term really bugs me especially since i've already seen their faces on sonograms. I just feel so unsupported and he also put me through so much sadness and stress throughout this pregnancy i just felt like i deserve better right? Before he left, he said i am selfish and basically kinda blamed everything on me.

I told my mom what happened and asked her to keep it quiet as I know what her bf is like. Obviously she didnt (Im not mad everything shes done for me I could never be mad) but he keeps making snarky comments to me about my abortion. 

The day before I went to the clinic I was talking to my mom and basically we think Im getting arthritis in my ankle as I broke it 2 years ago and my mom said aw honey youre too young to have arthritis already. He jumped in and said its not the only thing shes too fucking young for. My mom gave out to him and I just glared at him try not to escalate things. 

Another time I was on the phone to my mom and was telling her one of the girls at work finally had her baby. Her bf over heard the word baby and I heard him say dont tell me she fucking pregnant again.

Im going home on Saturday for 2 weeks and I really dont want to deal with him.

"871",871,"My medical abortion at 31 years old","2025-04-10",1744278308,"My medical abortion at 31 years old","I am writing this post because of how helpful everyones experiences were during my weeks leading up to my medical abortion. Its a long one so buckle up! 

Im 31 years old and married with a new home. Most of my friends and family have or are trying for babies. I was on birth control pills since I was like 17 I thought it was about time to get off to get my body ready. Thats not to say we were ready I just knew in the next few years we would start trying. I was off the pill for like 2 months. We had sex. Pull out method. In hindsight I was dumb. I missed my period and just to calm down before a vacation I took a test. Never in my mind did I think it would be positive. It was. We cried. We are not ready. We just do not have the time or funds right now to raise a child. And selfishly I thought of all my summer plans that would be ruined. Initially I was set on keeping it I couldnt fathom being 31 and aborting a child it felt so wrong I still feel wrong. My husband eventually convinced me to consider abortion. I hated him for it at first but he was right we are struggling just to pay our ridiculously high mortgage bringing a child into a financial struggle is never a good idea. Also were just not ready I would try to picture it while with my friends and sisters kids and was not feeling like I could do it yet. No part of me was like yes I want this. Which isnt fair to a baby. So I went to a womens clinic in my state (abortion is still legal here thankfully). I couldve got the pills online but I craved guidance. They were wonderful and the support I needed. Unfortunately I went to close to my vacation which would require a long flight so they advised I wait until I return. Vacation sucked because I was about 5 weeks and got struck with morning sickness. And stress about the situation so in hindsight I wouldve just done it before and prayed I passed the pregnancy in time. Which I did fairly quickly in the end. Before I talk about that Im going to share how lonely I felt during this time. 

It was about 4 weeks between finding out and doing the medical abortion. It was an unbelievably lonely time. My husband is amazing and very supportive but hes a man and I felt he didnt truly feel or share my pain. I told 3 close friends because I needed girl support. And they were amazing and supportive. I didnt tell my sisters who are my rocks because I was so scared of their judgement and it still crushes me that I didnt have them through this and that theyll never know my struggle. So many people I wanted to tell and have their suppprt but if they didnt support me it wouldve crushed me. I constantly crushed myself with thoughts like. I know I want kids soon so whats a year before. I was stupid why should my unborn baby pay for my mistakes. Im old and we have jobs and could swing it I guess, how can I go through with this? Im religious too so I kept thinking God will never forgive me this is murder. I lived on Reddit and Google. Searched what a 7 week old fetus looks like over and over. Tried to justify that it couldnt feel (according to most). Its the size of a pea but looks like a tadpole so to me its a life. The inner struggle was immense and I know this will burden me but in the end Im happy with my decision. I prayed to God to keep this baby for now and send it back when were ready. Okay now for my MA experience. 

I went back to the clinic yesterday. The doctor confirmed through ultrasound I was 7 weeks along. I cried and expressed my guilt she tried to comfort me that it reallly is just cells right now. After that they give you the pills and that doctor or nurse was so cool and listened to my struggle and shared her own story. It helped I felt a little better. I took the 1st pill there. No real effect from that one slight cramping and diarrhea but nothing crazy. I put the four pills in my cheeks around 10 pm tonight. Let them sit for 20 mins and washed down with water followed by ib profen and Benadryl. Within an hour I felt light cramps then about 30 mins later the rough ones came. Nothing unbearable. I curled up with my hearing pad and breathed through it. I read awful experiences prior so I was thinking this is gonna get so much worse. But it didnt it kept at about a 7/10 for an hour. I could feel I was bleeding so I went and sat on the toilet. So much blood. And maybe the pregnancy came out? Its hard to tell. I puked pretty badly at this point and then I was fine. No pain no nausea. I bled a lot more the next couple hours. Its been about 5 hours since then and no more pain. Just exhaustion and sadness. But also relief. I know this was the right thing. Its the hardest decision Ive ever made but it should be hard ! Its a big decision involving another life. I hope this finds someone struggling with the same decision and helps them. Youre doing whats right for you no matter how much it hurts or feels wrong you will get through this!","abortion",3,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jvtzxn/my_medical_abortion_at_31_years_old/"

About a week and a half ago, I took 2 at home pregnancy tests and both of which quickly showed positive. Immediately my stomach dropped, panic attack set in QUICK. It was an extremely emotional, difficult decision to make as I have always wanted to be a mother. And I still do want this for myself some day when the time is right. My partner and I both agreed that while we want to have that life together, its just not time yet. The next day I went over to the local hospital to get blood work done so I could find out how far along I was and to be sure that I was okay and the baby was where it was supposed to be, just so I wouldnt need an emergency procedure. Im not going to lie, the hardest part about this whole thing was the anxiety behind it all. hearing the congratulations, and the judgement. I live in a very blue state, but it turns out that its not as blue as I thought it was. The best advice I can give is to just remind yourself that those people who say and feel judgement towards your decision truly have no impact on your life, and you will never have to face them again. Its your decision, its your body, its your life.

because the hospital trip was on a Sunday, I had to wait until Monday morning to call clinics and find out where I can get the help I needed. I did my research, and I knew that I absolutely wanted to go the surgical route to avoid as much added pain and trauma as I could. All I wanted was to get past this and heal. I called around to local clinics, lots of which did not even perform the procedure, and the ones that did would not offer any sedation. finally, I found a clinic about 2.5 hours from where I live ( out of state ) who did offer the twilight sedation (MODERATE IV SEDATION) and set up an appointment for the following week (today). 
the anxiety, waiting was the most difficult part. I do want to mention I already deal with anxiety and especially health anxiety as it is, which was not helping my case. but regardless, its a scary thing. 
-
I woke up at 5:30 am, I packed extra undies (girl boxer undies) , a box of pads, phone charger, heating pad, chapstick, my blanket, a snack, and my stuffed animal. My partner and I made it to the clinic right on time. For context, I was 6 weeks and 3 days. My anxiety really set in when we arrived. I filled out some paperwork and sat in the waiting room until my name was called. A nurse opened the door, called me back and I was in a room that just looked like a normal doctors office room. There she did an internal ultrasound (not painful at all!! just felt a little weird) I dont want to use the word uncomfortable, because that word makes me question how it truly feels, but I promise you it does not hurt. I then had to put the pad they gave me in my undies. After this was done, I was given an antibiotics pill, as well as an anti nausea pill.
 I took those meds and was brought back to the recovery room where I was in a very cozy recliner with a blanket. I was nervous still as I could hear other procedures being done (the suction machine) which made me really question if I could handle this. A nurse came up to me, she gave me 2 small pills of Xanax and put in my IV. I wasnt worried for the iv as I do pretty well with needles. through the iv she gave me more anti nausea medicine and pain medicine. I sat there for maybe 30 mins and my name was called once again. I was told to go and empty my bladder. when I stood up I felt almost as if I was drunk, but I felt more calm because of the Xanax. 15-30 or so minutes after this I was taken to the procedure room. I could feel my nerves again, and im not gonna lie, i was crying because i was scared. the nurse was wonderful, she assured me I would be okay and that it would be very quick. She administered the anesthesia through my iv and the next thing i know, im sitting up to go back to the recovery room. I asked thats it? Im done?. I was asked to go to the bathroom and check my pad, there wasnt much blood. I went back to the recovery room and i was given some snacks and water. and that was it!!

I felt pretty out of it from the cocktail of drugs given to me, my partner got me Taco Bell (my favorite) and every time Id wake up in the car Id eat and fall right back asleep. when we got home I took a long nap, and woke up with some mild cramps. I took 1000mg of Tylenol and Im using my heating pad which helps immensely! my bleeding is extremely minimal, little to no pain. I feel so relieved and so grateful that my experience went as well as it did. Please feel free to ask me any questions.

This happened 4 years ago but Im still dealing with a lot of emotions from it because I have never seeked help due to the fear of being judged and shamed, I grew up in a very conservative family in Tennessee and I still live in this state. At the time of this happening I was in a situation-ship with a guy I lived with, I was going through a very difficult divorce that had its own traumas, and I was already a mother of one. I found out I was pregnant and while I had some mixed feelings I was ultimately ready to have another baby and could see a future with my partner at the time. Looking back I realize how codependent I was with this person and how unhealthy the dynamic was but at the time I thought he was healthy for me and I needed to learn good relationship values from him. When I told him of the pregnancy he was very angry, he told me I needed an abortion and that we couldnt have a baby. I tried to talk things over with him and express my mixed emotions of the abortion but he told me I could do whatever I wanted but that if I didnt get the abortion he would feel forced to marry me and would hate me for the rest of our lives and would never be able to genuinely love me. This terrified me because at the time I was begging for his approval to fill a hole that had been made by every man in my life before him, I agreed to the abortion, he took me to get the pills, then drove me home like nothing was wrong. I can still remember feeling instant regret after swallowing the first pill and crying by myself in the bathroom at 3 a.m as the medicine did its job. For a very long time I didnt realize the gravity of the role he played in this, I blamed myself for everything and hid it from everyone. I sat with these terrible feelings for years and let them fester. I remember a few months after the abortion is when roe v wade was being overturned, I expressed my disgust to my boyfriend about the politics and how every woman has the right to her bodily autonomy but surprisingly my boyfriend said he agreed that abortion should be banned. We got into a very heated debate and I brought up our situation and he told me, yea I wanted you to have it but I will never respect you for doing it and this shattered me. We broke up thankfully a little while later and I was able to escape the toxic relationship we were in. What Im looking for here is any kind of advice or support on how to begin working through the guilt and shame I have felt for years over this situation. I never talk about it with people because Im too afraid but its getting to a point where I cant keep carrying all of this by myself.

I am a girl; an 18 year old. Three days ago, I chose to take the abortion pills I ordered. I got my pills from Aid Access, relatively easy. My mother helped me as I seriously lean on my parents; for the better and worse right now. Anyway, I received them. Me and my boyfriend quickly agreed, more than before I received the pills; to choose to end the baby. There were instructions in an email, and instructions on the bottles I received. One was mifepristone, one pill. The other was misoprostol, eight pills. My boyfriend and Is plan was to have me take the first pill, mifepristone. Then 24 hours later, take the next pills. I would take the misoprostol in a hotel room, him getting off work early to support me there too. 

Things went as planned the first day. I attended my school. I am in high school still; long story. I went to school that day after taking the first pill, mifepristone, and felt fine for that 24 hours after. Because I took the pill at 11 am, and my boyfriend picked me up to get the room around 5:30 pm the next day, I ended up doing the second step a couple hours over the 24 hour mark. I had a small clot come out before I left the house for the hotel with my boyfriend, as well. I took 4 pills, as instructed, underneath my tongue to dissolve, as instructed. It took around 30 minutes to dissolve. Before they finished dissolving, the misoprostol severely hurt my stomach and lower pelvic area. I was only 7 weeks along, I forgot to mention that. I was not expecting such pain. I also took 800 mg of ibuprofen before, and a prescription nausea medication. I ended up writhing in pain for about an hour, and my boyfriend was helpless. I was screaming and cramping, but there was hardly any blood. The pain throughout this time was a 10/10. After I threw up a couple of times, pretty close together, I managed to not scream anymore as the pain started to subside and called my mom to come take me to the hospital. My boyfriend stayed at the room. If you vomit 30 minutes after the pills dissolve, then you dont have to take the same dose right away. Otherwise, you are supposed to. I vomited 25 minutes after they pretty much dissolved, and was not willing to go through that level of pain again. I knew that I needed stronger pain killers, and was not warned that this would happen in the instructions, or by anyone elses stories on Reddit/ the internet. 

Anyway, I finally got to the hospital. On the drive with my mom, the pain had somewhat gone down to a 5/10 from a great 111100010101/10. As soon as I got there, I started cramping and feeling terrible again. I was bleeding out more. It took 2-3 hours for me to get some kind of pain relief, as I was told the doctors were making sure it was a miscarriage. I screamed in the waiting room, and yelled and yelled and begged for over an hour and a half for help or some pain relief. They gave me 200 mg of Tylenol, which did nothing. I felt bad because there were multiple people listening to this. Finally, I was given morphine. It still did not kill the pain, I felt okay enough to be quiet though. Finally. My mom was not able to sit with me through this either until later. I got the medication after I got an ultrasound done, too.
My mom was able to see me about an hour after the morphine dose. I passed a large veiny clot and flooded a couple pads with dark blood clots before the pain killers. I had a pelvic exam done, which I had never gotten. This was somewhat relieving actually. Later on, an obgyn came in and asked questions. My pain was slowly getting worse again but manageable. I told him I knew for sure it was not an ectopic pregnancy, and that I passed a major veiny clot after the ultrasound. I let him look at my cervix and pick out remaining tissues to help the bleeding. This was harmless but I still squeezed my moms hand because it left weird and sensitive. Only took less than 10 minutes. Being drugged helped. He wanted to send these pieces to a lab anyway to be sure it was all fetal tissue. I didnt need anymore meds and was told everything should pass naturally from here. I can expect bleeding up to a few weeks from now. By the way, I was in the hospital yesterday into early this morning. He told me that I didnt need antibiotics, just sent me away with pain killers. I loved that guy he was so cool, collected and calm. Like one of those good doctors on a TV show if you know what I mean. This was my experience. I would say, there are experiences like this that are not talked about anywhere or that are hard to find, that are extremely painful. Please, please, please be careful with what you choose to do. I dont regret what I did. I wish I went to the hospital right after taking my second pills, if you can do so. Especially if you have very painful periods or another ovary/uterus condition or anything. Thank you for reading =O. I am okay now, just some cramping here and there, I took a walk to write this. I am a Christian. I still have my what ifs and stuff, and probably will forever. 

Other things that are noteworthy: I originally found out I was pregnant because I went into the emergency room for bad pelvic pain. I was seeking some kind of diagnosis, thinking I may have endometriosis or something. I still need to get that checked out. But ended up finding out I was pregnant. I still decided to do the medical abortion though. I was panicking. I have rh- blood type, which means I dont have a specific protein on my blood cells. Only 15% of the population has this. I am at risk for miscarriages for all attempted babies in the future, but I dont plan on having children. I am sure I will not get pregnant again. I dont want sex anymore, I will be monitoring basal temperature and on birth control. I denied the shot they offer to prevent your body from creating an immune response to a baby with rh positive blood type. You should get this shot if you want to have kids in the future, and have rh- blood type. I also had a slight fever going into the hospital; 99.5.

The rest of Sunday I bled and cramped like I would on day 2 of my period, some clots here and there nothing crazy.

Passed a few big clots maybe the size of a golf ball over the course of the morning but no pain anymore. Still bleeding but its slowed down a bit this afternoon. 

Ill update my post if anything crazy happens but it seems like this is about it for my journey.

I had two young kids from a previous relationship and we had a son in 2019. In 2020, he started drinking heavily and became extremely emotionally abusive almost constantly as well as physically abusive at times. Fast forward to March 2024, I left him. His drinking worsened and my kids were absolutely torn by the separation. Mostly my younger two, my oldest was actually doing alright with the situation as she did not like us being together. 
Fast forward to November. His mom passed away and we ended up back together on the midst of the grief. Things were GREAT for months. I got pregnant in February and EVERYTHING took a turn for the worse. Hes definitely drank a few times. The emotional abuse started again. Hes constantly going through my phone. Bringing up things that I did during our separation - when we first got back together we made a promise that anything that happened with either of us during that time was private and wouldnt be brought up. He consistently crosses that boundary, is back to name calling and being controlling. 

I want to leave. And I dont know if I want to follow through with this pregnancy. Co parenting our son was horrible. I cant add another baby into this. 

I was healing during our separation as hard as it was. And now I feel like I made the biggest mistake by coming back into this.

Im 28 yrs old &amp; had an unplanned/unexpected pregnancy January 2025. It was my first ever pregnancy &amp; unfortunately I fell pregnant after only knowing the father over phone conversations over the course of a few months &amp; 2 dates. Im not proud of it, but it happened. Luckily for me, he never left me to deal with this on my own &amp; tried to support me in ways he could especially because we live 2 hours away. We had many conversations on what we wanted to do about the pregnancy and ultimately decided it was best due to the timing, were not in relationship &amp; our personal lives/situations that we would terminate the pregnancy. When we decided this, we had only known for less than a week that I was pregnant. Unfortunately I called planned parenthood &amp; they told me I wouldnt be able to be seen until I was about 6 weeks. At the time I was incredibly early &amp; only about 3 weeks pregnant. They made my appointment for the end of January &amp; by then I would be about 7 weeks. The issue with this is that they gave me 3 weeks to sit with the pregnancy &amp; I began to think heavily about it every day &amp; began to get attached..= It was also very hard for me knowing that time was going by &amp; the baby was growing every day. Fast fwd, its the day of my appointment &amp; I get my first ultrasound. I see the baby &amp; a faint heart beat. They then scheduled me a week out to proceed with the MA. By then, I would be 9 weeks pregnant. I was completely shattered &amp; heart broken. I went back &amp; forth with myself wondering what I should do. I let the father know it was getting to be super super hard for me &amp; I was struggling with the idea of having an abortion now &amp; he shared feelings of being scared that I wasnt going to go through with the termination. We had many more talks &amp; although I knew for my own sake &amp; the this baby that it was the correct thing to do for this time in my life, I struggled so hard when the day came for my MA. == I went through with the MA at 9 weeks &amp; it has now been almost 2 months &amp; the grief &amp; heartbreak has been incredibly heavy. Im now seeing a therapist &amp; it has helped alot. How ever, Im dealing with alot of feelings of anger &amp; hurt with the father. I had decided to stop talking to him due to me going through a lot &amp; not wanting to be social with anyone. I did shut him out, how ever my feelings are hurt that he hasnt reached out to see how Im doing&my therapist advised me to reach out &amp; ask him. I havent built up the courage to do it because it makes me angry &amp; upset when I think about it. She also reminded me that everyone deals with situations differently and I cant assume anything without knowing &amp; that men especially deal with things differently than us women.

I am 30 and already a mother of 3, with my youngest being 8 months old. It was recently my birthday weekend and of course, my husband and I got carried away. I am on the pill but have recently not been the best at taking it when I should, I did take a plan B the day after our intercourse. Now of course, since our unprotected sex just happened this weekend I cannot confirm that I am pregnant, but I have been having nonstop bloating, and just a weird feeling that conception happened this past weekend and the plan B failed. My husband is highly religious and against abortion, and while I am also religious, I am more liberal on most political issues one of them being abortion. When we found out I was pregnant with my now 8-month-old, I considered abortion then and told my husband. He was against it and eventually talked me out of going through with it ( I was literally at the clinic, about to take the pill, then chickened out last minute and left). It turned out to be a great decision as I love my baby and cannot imagine a life without him, but If I am pregnant this time will be extremely different. Having two so young and close in age would be devastating on my mental health as I am already dealing with postpartum from this last pregnancy. We have a 6 year old, 3 year old, and 8 month old and I really want to focus solely on them and give my body a break from having babies back to back, We currently do not have the space. Our 8 month old is already room sharing with us because we are out of bedrooms at our house, AND not to mention the economy under the current president is such a shot in the dark, adding another mouth to feed and potential daycare expenses would be a huge burden financially, esp when we are already barely getting by each month. An abortion IS the right decision for our current circumstances, and deep in his heart he would know that as well, but based on our last experience, he would completely ignore every reason I just explained and still be against it. That is why I would plan to keep it away from him. I plan to take a pregnancy test in the next two weeks and if it comes back back positive I will schedule an appointment with a local clinic. I will have to move quickly as I live in a state that has abortions banned after the 5 week mark. I could take off work for a day, pretend like I am going to work, but instead go to the clinic for my appointment. I would have to do surgical so everything is done in the office, and I don't have to worry about dealing with passing the baby at home where he would surely catch on. I would need to be able to drive myself home that day, and be able to function as normal for the remainder of the day, so I am not sure which pain management option would be best, but I do want one. I could ask my mother for help that day, who would be 100000% supportive, but I do not want to implicate her in anything that I am doing if he ever did find out.  Has anyone ever had to do this? Keep an abortion from your husband? How did you do it? How did you keep it hidden? Please give me some guidance because I am freaking out. Hopefully, I am not pregnant and do not have to go through this at all. If that is the case I will schedule an Essure with my doctor and also do so secretly as my husband has also been against more aggressive forms of birth control and is only okay with the pill.","abortion",52,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jpxhva/if_i_am_pregnant_i_plan_to_hide_an_abortion_from/"

I knew I wanted children eventually but finding out I was pregnant (after being, I ultimately confirmed, stealthed) within the circumstances of my life at that time capsized me straight to rock bottom. Feeling hopeless and with my fragile mental-health spiraling, I had a surgical abortion exactly one month to the day after conception. The hormonal tidal wave and grief consumed me for a few weeks but the world kept moving in its indifference, and 22 year old me with it.

One year after my abortion, I met the lovely person I would marry. Three years after terminating my 6 week pregnancy, I accepted the job opportunity that would establish my career. Four years after my SA, my spouse and I bought a house. And six years after choosing to end a pregnancy, I gave birth to the first of two vibrant, healthy, brilliant, beautiful little humans. Those two are now teens and the children I was absolutely destined to parent.

Due to our cultural, family, social and economic conditions we decided to abort& were in a very long distance relationship and both University students.

Shes taken the medical pill route alone, went through the pain  alone and all of a sudden a fetus appears, I was shocked so I can only imagine how she felt. I believe due to my ignorance I had no idea this would have happen.

Shes still in the midst of pain and bleeding and to me what looks like border line depression, she cries to me on the phone asking herself if we made the right choice and if God would ever forgive her. Shes always wanted a child moreover a son so& as her partner what can I say??

Background. I am divorced with kids already and do not want more we have been together over a year, she has medical issues where pregnancy is not safe for her. When she found out she was pregnant we did the math and it had to of happened right after her period ended. She called the clinic (had to drive a long distsnce) and booked an appointment. 2 days later she had a miscarriage so we cancelled. Fast forward to a week later and we went to the Dr to just confirm the mc. They had bloodwork done and her hcg was over 25000, dr thought it might of been twins. 3 days later her hcg had dropped to 13k. We were happy. Fast forward to last week and we had an ultrasound and somehow there is a hulk embryo with a heartbeat. Measured at slightly over 7 weeks. She has been in a sever state of depression. We booked with the clinic again and made the 7 hour drive. Right now I am sitting in the parking lot and messaging her as I am not allowed in. I just want to get some advise on how to best support her through this. Yesterday I took her on a drive and we went to her favorite restaurants in this city. She is just having a really hard time with very few people to talk to as her family is quite conservative. Help please!

He has taken me on an emotional roller coaster the last few weeks and I feel mentally drained. He told me feels trapped now I am pregnant and doesn't want to be here full time in the uk, so we decided it wasn't the right time to have a baby.
We were watching TV the morning after I took the first pill and something come on about having a new baby and he said oh I envy her having a baby, my heart just broke. I felt the worst pain, I am mid abortion and he says that, I just burst out crying and sobbed and then he couldn't understand why I was upset to make it worse.
Anyway I feel so broken right now, I can't stop crying and thinking how much I loved my baby and wanted him/her but how can I with a man like that and don't want to do it alone.

I want to make it clear that I do not regret my abortion. I accept my choice and I understand why it was the best option at the time. Still, I hate it. My situation was not ideal. However, my partner has always been supportive of me whether or not I chose to keep baby.

I understand now abortion is a divine choice. As long as you are following your intuition and acting in love, you are making the right choice. I dont believe people choose abortion lightly and I want others to know that I am sending love and good energy your way because we all deserve to heal and be our best version in this life and beyond.

As you recover consider this:
- EAT healthy Whole Foods that provide iron and vitamins to aid in your bleeding. Meats, bone broths, and red foods.
- HEAT is your best friend: warm water bottles, herbal teas (Raspberry Leaf Tea helps with cramping), and blankets. 
- REST is for warriors. Dont push your body past its limits. You may not feel it now, but you will feel it eventually if you force it. 
- FEEL it through. The best way to get over something is to go through it. Feel everything and dont numb. Journaling and walking are good for clearing your mind.

As far as hating the abortion:
My decision to abort my child was rooted in love for my baby and keeping them safe. As I reflect, their safety was rooted in my fears. I was afraid of being judged. I was afraid it was not the right time. I was afraid that I would end up alone and cast aside. I let go of the fear now and I believe that we should all live and let live. Respectfully, it shouldnt matter what anyone thinks with the exception of your partner if they care to be involved. Your decision should come from your own gut and your own heart. In the language of Nahuatl, the womb is Cihuayotl or a womans second heart. Trust yourself and yourself alone to make the right decision and it will bring you peace.

During my abortion, I felt guided by my ancestors, angels and God. I took the experience as an opportunity to reconnect with my body and heal. Healing is messy and not the paradise people envision it to be. Healing is bloody, painful, tiring, lonely. In the midst of the journey, sometimes I feel rays of light bless me, I feel supported by community, and I get glimpses of my higher self.

I forgive myself for removing my baby from my body, and I have faith that their spirit is being kept safe. I trust my baby in the hands of goddess Chichihualcoatl, and I thank her for watching over their spirit while I recover physically, mentally, spiritually and emotionally.

I anxiously await my babys return. Safe and sound. Beautiful and whole.

however, i still feel like no one will like f\*cking really talk about the range of emotions that accompany it. i am in a very difficult situation with my partner about his unresolved grief and my own unresolved grief, and there are no ""grand narratives"" about what to do in such a situation. abortion is never a plot or a background psychological thing someone deals with in a movie, there are no podcasts about abortion beyond about the legalities of thereof, and i just hate how when you really dig into the subject, the nuance is gone or there's this underlying ""well, i support your choice, and i agree it was right for you, but also it's regrettable that it happened in the first place"" which drives me insane.

sorry for this rant, tl;dr it's 2025 and only having my own abortion made me realize how much people do not wanna discuss abortion on a nuanced and deep level.

Im hoping this can help anyone currently making this tough decision. I also wanted to share what life has looked like for me after. Anyones thoughts on this, questions, and similar stories are welcome.

Im in southwest USA. I had an abortion in 2020. Aged 22. My boyfriend at the time worked across the country and we had a long distance relationship. We were dedicated to each other, our first love, new and exciting for us both. He wasnt perfect, and neither was I. We were both kind of toxic, jealous, and immature. Im not at all the same person I was back then, and Im sure he isnt either. We were invested in trying to make things work, though we just couldnt change for the better of us. 

I eventually became pregnant. I had stopped birth control to feel more natural with my hormones. We rarely used condoms as he didnt like the way they felt, I guess I didnt either. I took the plan B pill, and this time it didnt work. I could have been safer, obviously. But what I could have or should have done doesnt change things. 

I knew from the second I tested +, after missing my first period that this was NOT the kind of life I wanted. He would not be present in our lives, no doubt, and wasnt attentive to our relationship as it was. I had no means to support a child with a career I didnt have. I still believe an abortion was the most logical and responsible thing I could have done for myself. 

It was a no brainer for me, and I called to schedule an abortion the very day I found out. I had to wait another month, as they thought it would be safer when I was at least 8 weeks along. Nobody was allowed to go with me as this was the height of COVID. I opted for the medication method. I felt I could pass the pregnancy by myself at home, maybe allowing myself to grieve in a more intimate way. 

It was sad. I felt grief and guilt. I was all alone. Up all night, wishing for relief. I mourned the passing of the birth until the sun came up. And Im glad I had the time to do that, even if it was all alone. Though I was full of grief and feelings of melancholy, I did not and still do not regret my decision. I knew this was the most responsible and safe decision I could have made.

A few months later, we broke up for unrelated reasons. Im so glad we did. I wondered at the time if having a baby with him would make him feel obligated to try to work things out with me, not for loving me.

Please remember that you are making choices that are best for YOU. Please also be mindful who you choose to tell about your abortion. Even family or friends that have known you all your life.

I dont regret my decision. It was an extremely hard one to make. It was the right choice for me. And I dont believe anyone asks to make a decision like this. I still struggle with grief and guilt, but not like I used to. I still consider myself religious, more spiritual theses days. 5 years later and I have an amazing husband. With the help of him, therapy, and my own self trust, I am healing everyday. 

I have no regrets about the choice I made. As Ive mentioned several times above. I am a good person with a good heart. And I hope to have kids someday in a healthy environment that Im working hard to create. Grief and guilt are expected, but those feelings dont define me. And I have much better and brighter things to look forward to. ","abortion",11,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1joacw5/my_abortion_was_5_years_ago_i_promise_it_gets/"

Ive been slacking off at my job. I just got accepted into grad school for May, and I know for a fact my mental state wouldve interfered with that.

Ive come to the extremely difficult conclusion that what I thought I wanted Im not quite ready for. There is no way I can tell my boyfriend, mother or best friend the truth. They are all over the moon about this pregnancy while I am drowning inside. I plan to say I miscarried and get on birth control ASAP. This experience has made me realize I am no where near ready to become a parent.

God help me because the guilt is already setting in, but I do feel relief.

Any comforting words would be appreciated as I have absolutely no support and am completely alone in this. ","abortion",8,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jjzf8i/just_took_mife_have_zero_support_god_help_me/"

Took the mife pill in clinic with the team, no side effects. Started the premeds (dramamine and ibuprofen) at 2:15pm and 2:45pm, respectively. 
3:15pm: vaginally inserted 4 of the miso pills, had my maxi pad and hot pad ready. 
3:45-5:15pm: this is probably out of the norm but I took a long walk and ran one errand. I wasn't yet feeling anything. Did have a bowel movement but nothing out of the ordinary for me.
5:15-6:15pm: cramps and noticeable bleeding, cramps were low grade (3/10) and doing activities (I was cooking) was tolerable.
6:15-7:15pm: cramps started to intesify to ~5/10, but activities were still tolerable. I took a hot shower, and then I tried to eat dinner, but started getting intense waves of nausea. Some mild diarrhea.
7:15pm: vaginally inserted 4 more miso pills per my doctor's instructions.
7:15-8:15pm: could not eat anything due to the nausea. I wasn't yet throwing up, but having intense, painful heaving. I took another dramamine. cramping pain 7/10.
8:15-9:15pm: i finally threw up a little bit (nothing in my stomach, mostly bile). it was painful, my whole body was contracting like no nausea/throwing up I've experienced before. the nausea also would come up out of the blue and hit very intensely. cramping pain 7/10. I took more ibuprofen at 8:20pm as directed by my doctor.
9:15-10:15pm: cramping pain 9/10, nausea and throwing up. I had chills and was sweating profusely. these were the hardest hours. I was trying to sleep and relax, and nothing seemed to ease my discomfort. Because of the nausea and the bleeding, I sat on the toilet for a while, until I realized that I was going to fall asleep on the toilet, and I finally fell asleep.
12:15am: woke up, pain had gone down to a 7/10, but as I moved around to change my pad, it increased back up to an 8 or 9/10. Somehow I was able to get back to sleep fairly quickly.
7am: woke up for the day, feeling so much better. no sweating or nausea, very mild if not no cramping 0-1/10, still bleeding but less than the evening/night. I wasn't yet throwing able to tolerate food without any nausea, throwing up or diarrhea. I bled more the whole next day with some on and off 1/10 cramping, but very mild bleeding and very mild cramping.

For me personally, the late evening hours with the intense cramping and nausea/vomiting were the worst pain and discomfort I've ever felt, but knowing that it was temporary really helped. I felt immeasurably better the next day and felt such a huge weight off me. Having my hot pad and giving myself grace were the best things for me. I had a tough situation because I had to deal with this alone, and would have felt better with someone there, but circumstances forced this. I definitely have a high pain tolerance, so keep that in mind as well.

I hope this helps someone. This was the best decision for myself and my family and all I felt afterwards was relief.","abortion",4,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jfsdpi/medical_abortion_at_5_weeks_hour_by_hour/"

I currently pregnant and just confused on whether I should keep the baby or not.

Im currently 11 weeks. I finally had went to the doctor today and she talked to me about my options for abortion. She told me I would be put under anesthesia and the procedure is 15 minutes. I told her Ill think about it as idk if I want to move further with this. So told her Ill let her know 

Before I went to talk to the doctor I called my boyfriend to get reassurance and he just sounds fend up with me because for the last 2 weeks Ive been indecisive if I want to keep the baby or not. And he said he really wants to be a father but hes fine with whatever I want to do. And hell stay with me no matter what. 

We had an argument last week Saturday because I said idk if want to keep the baby again. And after the argument I didnt bring the topic up in 3 days . He then just assumed Im keeping the baby cause I didnt say anything .

Now I come home and all his things he usually leaves by me is all packed up like he just left. 

He hasnt called me the whole day to check on me. And I called him an hour ago he didnt answer the phone and texted him if hes free to talk.

I took the miso pills at around 11 am vaginally along with an anti nausea pill and 800 mg ibuprofen. It wasnt until about 1:30 that I s to intensify and that pain lasted for about an 1.5-2 hours.

I think the most important thing is to treat it as labor pains. Make sure youre working with gravity and sitting in a position to push all of the pregnancy tissue out. And make sure youre working with the cramps/contractions and giving a slight push when you feel them.

Also all of my pregnancy symptoms are gone now. I dont feel the extreme fatigue that I had, the nausea, the disgust I had from food, and I feel a lot of relief from my decision. ","abortion",3,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jlb8q7/10_week_ma_positive_experience/"

Ive spent the last few weeks in a storm of emotions, research, anxiety, and deep reflection  and I wanted to write this post for *you*, the one scrolling Reddit at 2 AM, scared, confused, and unsure. This is my big sister guide  no judgment, just honest support.

**How I got pregnant despite using the i-pill:**

I took the i-pill (emergency contraception) twice on the day I had sex. I thought I was safe. But emergency contraception is not 100% effective; especially if youve already ovulated. I didnt know that at the time. Took a test after 11 days, came back positive.

Id done everything right, and still found myself here.

**Choosing surgical abortion:**

I weighed my options  medical vs surgical. I was just under 5 weeks along. I chose surgical (D&amp;C) for several reasons:

- I wanted clarity, closure, and minimal days of waiting and wondering.
- I didnt want to deal with days of bleeding and uncertainty.( since I live with my family and can not not let anyone know)
- I had the budget and access to a good clinic with experienced doctors.

**The procedure (D&amp;C under anaesthesia; 5-6 hours total hospital stay):**

- You fast for around 68 hours before the procedure.
- At the hospital, youll get a quick check, a cannula, an antibiotic injection and then head to the OT.
- General anaesthesia &amp; sedation = you feel nothing. ( Literally, no pain ) 
- The actual procedure is super quick. I was in and out in under 30 minutes.
- I woke up drowsy but pain-free. Felt fine within few minutes.
-Nurses were kind. They gave me food and I was discharged in 2 hours.
-I had very light bleeding for a few hours. I even went to a cafe nearby to eat out. No pain; no terrifying amounts of blood.

**Recovery (first 2448 hours):**

- Light bleeding or none at all is normal.
- Cramps might come and go. Mine were mild, mostly just bloating and pelvic heaviness.
- Emotionally, it hits harder than physically. Be kind to yourself.
- I had rectal pressure and gas pain  walking helped.

**If youre RH-negative ( negative blood group) like me:**

- Please dont panic. I was terrified about RH sensitization.
- I got the Anti-D (Rhogam) shot 2 hours after the procedure  totally safe and routine.
- With the shot, you are *highly protected*. Future pregnancies can be healthy and safe.

**Things I wish someone told me:**
- You are NOT alone. Take someone with you if possible 
- You *can* have healthy pregnancies in the future.

- Stay off Reddit forums that spiral into horror and scary stories. Focus on YOURSELF.

**To anyone going through this:**

Youre not a statistic; youre a human. And youre going to be okay.

If you have any questions, Im happy to answer them. Text me. I know how much I needed someone like that and I did find someone. BIG THANKS TO HER. 

Take care of your body,
Remember IT IS NOT THE END OF THE WORLD. You will be fine!

My husband and I were unsure we wanted a 2nd- we went back and forth for about a year- and were trying thinking once we got pregnant it would all be good. When I found out I was pregnant i immediately felt terror and dread but kept it to myself for about a week. My mental health spiraled in that time- and finally I told him I didnt think I could do it. I was worried he would be upset- but he told me he was okay with termination as he was on the fence anyways and could see my mental health was at major risk. I had PPD bad with my son, and I could see it all coming back quickly. 

I told a few friends I was pregnant- and ultimately helped me feel supported in my decision to terminate. Your family is already perfect they said- and it made me feel really loved. 

They also helped me settle on the SA- multiple of them had them for their miscarriages- and told me it was better than doing it at home. 

I live in a state with open and legal abortion. I have a clinic in my town- I was able to schedule my SA for just 5 days away once I made my choice. I was so nervous about it I went to the clinic a few days early to talk to someone about it and get my initial stuff done. 

On the day of my procedure our friends picked our son up from school for us and fed him dinner so I could have my husband with me the whole time. My friends all texted me messages of love and support. The staff at planned parenthood was amazing- my experience was mostly painless, quick and supported. My husband held my hand as I cried- holding a photo of my family and a necklace my son had made me reading I love you mom on it. 

My recovery was quickly but my mental health took a dive. I quickly found help for my mental health from urgent care who gave me some anxiety rescue meds. I was able to go to therapy multiple times following my abortion with a therapist Ive been seeing for about a decade. She supported me and I felt like I would be okay. 

One month later I feel completely okay with having had an abortion. I dont feel guilt- and if I feel shame its only because society makes others believe so many bad things about it. I know I did the right thing for me and my family- and Im so grateful for all the support I had- and I also want to thank everyone who has shared their stories here- it helped me so much. 

Dare I say, I feel happy this door is now closed and I can move on with my life knowing that Ill only have one child- and feeling thankful that I had a choice as to whether or not I carried another child& it wasnt easy- none of it was east- but Im okay- Im good.

**note**: this is a detailed experience of mine so this will be a long post.

####how did i find out i was pregnant?

"" i noticed that my period was late. i was exactly one week late from my due date when i decided to take a pt. i was literally shaking and nervous when i did it. i did my first pt last *March 12*, and it immediately showed two dark red lines. it was so fast. i started crying and breaking down, and i immediately messaged my boyfriend about it. he was a bit in denial at first, so the day after, he bought 2 more pts (all in all i had 3 pts)

"" **March 13 - March 14**: i tested the 2 pts my bf bought, one on march 13 and one on march 14, and both came back positive.

**what symptoms did i notice?** honestly, only sore breasts, which is a typical PMS symptom for me, so i thought that my period was just late. i didn't give it much thought. but when my period was a week late, that's when things changed. my period does come late, but only for a maximum of 5 days. that's why i was really worried when it was a week late, so i decided to test. however, when i reached my 6 weeks (as per my LMP), i started to have nausea but it only occurs from late afternoon to night time, or when i travel (i do not have motion sickness), i also vomit. i had increased urgency in urinating, i was gassy and bloated, i have a super sensitive smell, and a bad food aversions (i do not even eat regularly because of this), and i also had light cramps from time to time. 

**note**: i did not do any TVS to confirm my gestational age and if my pregnancy is intrauterine since i do not want to have any records that i was pregnant. i found out that there was a TVS here at our province but only one clinic does it. no other places. 

####WoW donation and shipment process (this is a bit long and detailed)

"" that night i confirmed i was positive with just one pt, i immediately searched for reliable abortion sites and suprisingly Women on Web came up first. at first i wasnt sure about what i was doing, so i installed reddit and made this account. i even posted here to ask for info about WoW and WHW. that is where i found out that **FB sellers/local sellers sell fake meds so beware of that.**

"" i used the gestational age calculator on both websites and found out i was **5 weeks and 2 days** pregnant (LMP: Feb 4).

"" since im only a student and not financially stable, i worried about how to get the donation for WoW and WhW. i read stories here that they emailed WoW or WhW about their financial situation and were allowed to donate less than ¬70-¬90.

"" so i emailed WoW and WHW first before doing the online consultation to check if theyd accept a lower donation. WHW replied first and told me to do an online consultation and email them again after, which i did. hours later, WoW also replied and told me the same, so i did it and waited.

"" WoW replied first after i emailed about my financial status, and thankfully they allowed me to donate what i had  ±1000 (about ¬15). i promised to donate more if i will have extra money in the future.

"" the next morning (march 14 - 3rd pt), i tested using fresh urine (i read its more accurate) and it came back positive. my bf and i had a serious talk about our situation, and once we decided, we donated immediately to WoW. we are both graduating students, both do not have work, and we aren't financial capable, we agreed that this is the last choice for us. we want to have a family someday, but not now. we know that if we had this pregnancy in the right time, we are gladly to accept it and raise it. but we are not in a good situation now, we cannot afford to see our child suffer just because we cannot provide them their needs. 

**payment process**: for my payment process, i was having a hard time at first since i do not know how to use Gcash to Paypal method, then i read again throughly in Philippine Wiki so i used Maya Virtual Card to Paypal (used Gcash to transfer money in Maya &gt; created Maya Virtual Card &gt;  used Maya Virtual Card in Paypal as my debit card &gt; donated to WoW using Paypal (in euros)) **i used yt vids as my guide**

**note**: WHW replied later that day, saying i could donate my amount in hand but should complete it in 2 weeks. i didnt reply because i had no means to pay the balance. the money i donated to WoW came from my scholarship, not from the pocket money that my parents gave to me because i felt so guilty about it.

"" WoW was really accomodating and tried their best to reply to me as fast as possible. i was beyond thankful because that time they typically reply to me within minutes that's why they processed my payment and shipment fast. 

"" **March 15**: WoW confirmed my shipment. 2 days later, **March 17**, they sent me the tracking number. i tracked it using the 17Track and ParcelsApp. then when it reached the country, i used PHLPost tracking website.

"" since i am in the Visayas (Samar), i expected it will arrive within 2-3 weeks. the package arrived last **April 2** in our local PHLPost. they called me then i asked my bf to picked it up since he was near in the post office, i just gave him my 2 valid ids and an authorization letter. there were no charge fee. 

####MA timeline:
"" i decided to do my MA last April 3 &amp; 4. this was because i will not be busy during the weekends and i will be out of school.

"" prior the procedure, i made sure that i was educated enough about the process and that everything were planned out, i even made a timeline in my notes app and the things that i will need to buy and bring. i also asked some encouragement words in this subreddit. this really helped my anxiety. 

"" **for reference**: i am a woman in my 20s, a graduating student, 53kg 5'2

**Day 1 - April 3, 2025**

"" i went to the city first then bought my things/supplies with me for my day 2. 

"" **what i bought**: menstrual diapers (it was really comfy to wear), night pads, 3x 400mg ibuprofen, 3x meclizine (bonamine), 2 bottles of gatorade, snacks. i gave this to my bf as we will do my day 2 at his apartment 

"" i was **8 weeks and 1 day** when i did my day 1

6:30pm - took 1x 25mg meclizine (bonamine) because i really have a bad nausea and i also vomit but not that excessive only 1 to 2 times for a day. i consulted WoW about this if i could take an anti-nausea before the Mifepristone and they said it was okay to take an hour before the Mifepristone. i was really afraid that i will vomit the Mifepristone.

**note**: acc. to WoW, if you vomited the Mifepristone for *more than 20 minutes* after taking it, it does not influence the process and you should continue the process as instructed.

but if you vomited *within 20 minutes* after taking the Mifepristone, it might affect the process and won't work well. immediately contact WoW if you vomited the tablet within 20 minutes. ***this is the same with Misoprostol.***

7:30 pm - took 1x Mifepristone; i put on a pad because i read that Mifepristone can cause light bleeding (in preparation for it)

8:40 pm - i vomited because my nausea was very very bad. it burned my throat when i vomited i think it was the Mifepristone. other than nausea, i did not experience other side effects. no light bleeding.

**Day 2 - April 4, 2025**

"" i started off a bit late of 7:30pm for my day 2 because i was really busy at school. 

"" i went to my dormitory first and , **got the things that i needed**: such as my blanket, comfy pjs, heat pack, and thermometer (decided to bring it with me just in case i'll be experiencing chills or fever)

**FIRST DOSE**

7:00 pm - my boyfriend and i decided to order in Mcdo for our dinner, i only had a chicken burger because that time my nausea was bad again. i even had a hard time eating the burger but i decided to finish it off so that my stomach is not that empty. 

7:15 pm - i decided to take a shower first then put on my diaper pad. 

7:45 pm - took 1x 400 mg ibuprofen and 25mg meclizine 

8:00 pm - while waiting, me and my bf decided to set alarms for the time intervals of taking the Misoprostol starting 8:45 pm so that i can take the doses at the right time. 

8:45 pm - took 4x 200mcg Misoprostol sublingually (under the tongue), swallowed my saliva when it waters my mouth since it was okay to swallow the saliva per WoW. it tasted nothing but the texture was a bit chalky. we watched a movie while waiting

9:15 pm - after 30 minutes, i swallowed the remaining pills with water; as soon as it hit the mark, cramps also started from 2/10 to 20/10. i am not even exaggerating, it was very VERY painful. i was also shocked that it started immediately but i tried focusing on my breathing but it doesn't really help me. the cramps just keep on intensifying. i was crying in pain, i was trying different positions to ease the pain, i was using my heat pack, i was even squeezing my boyfriend's hand, then he also put efficascent oil in my lower abdomen *(puson)*but nothing really helped me. i do not know if i was exaggerating the pain since i have a low pain tolerance, but i had a confidence i can handle the pain since i have painful menstruations, but it was DIFFERENT. really different. it felt also that i did not take the ibuprofen.

9:49 pm - i vomited it was burning my throat again. my nausea was really bad during that time; i saw light bleeding from the pad. i seated in the toilet for the few minutes waiting to pass anything just to ease my pain, but it was nothing, i just had painful cramps. 

10:15 pm - i decided to go back to the cr;  i sat at the toilet then felt that i was passing blood but no clots, still a light bleeding though; minutes later, i vomited again. i drank gatorade a bit just to rehydrate myself but it was not that many since i do not want to vomit again.

**note**: usually you shouldn't eat or drink anything for 30 minutes - 1 hour after you vomited because you will still vomit it, but in my case, i did not have a proper dinner then i just vomited what i ate, so i was afraid of me being dehydrated and weak so i am trying to rehydrate myself so that i have the energy to go on the process. 

10:20 pm - i felt that i started passing clots in my pad, as soon i passed clots, my cramps started to subsided 6/10; it was on and off that time. 

10:29 pm- i decided to go back to cr again to check my pad and saw that i am already bleeding heavily (but not a concerning amount wherein i could fill 2 pads for 2 hours), it was just many; as i was seating at the toilet, i passed 3 clots. i couldn't see anything in the water; cramps were still there but they are starting to be less painful 3/10

10:33 pm - i decided to rest before my 2nd dose; i was rehydrating myself with gatorade and trying to focus on my breathing so that i will not drain my energy; i do not have the appetite to eat solid foods that time

10:35 pm - cramps started to be painful again 7/10; it was on and off but as it starts to cramp again it was more painful. i am trying to relieve it with my heat pack.

11:16 pm - i felt something big was coming out on me so i rushed to the cr, the moment i sat on the toilet i felt that i passed a big clot; i think it was a golf-sized clot, i did not check because i cannot see anything in the water of the toilet; bleeding continues. 

11:18 pm - i decided to gave myself a light snack 

11:20 pm - i decided to rest before the 2nd dose

**SECOND DOSE**

11:45 pm- my alarm rang and took the 2nd dose of misoprostol; it dissolved way faster under my tongue than the 1st dose, had to hold it in my mouth, controlling it to not to swallow until it reached the 30-minute mark

12:15 am - i swallowed the remains with water; cramps were back but not so painful 5/10, i am just relieving it with heat pack 

12:55 am - i went to the cr again to check my pad but as i sat, i passed another huge clot again, i saw it coming out from me. this time since i saw it, it was a cocoon-like clot. it was enclosed. it was about the size of a lemon. i do not know what i just passed so i emailed WoW about this (just described what i just saw).

1:18 am- took another 1x 400mg ibuprofen then i rested until the 3rd dose; i still have on &amp; off cramps so i just relieve it with my heat pack

1:45 am- i decided to change my pad not because it was soaked or full but for comfy reasons; my cramps subsided hence, i slept

**THIRD DOSE**

"" i took the third dose hours after the time i should have taken it since i slept so soundly.

"" i woke up 6:30 am then realized i was late for my 3rd dose. i also got a reply from WoW and advised me to take the 3rd dose. since i asked them about my cocoon-like clot, they said i passed probably the sac and i passed the pregnancy tissue normally. they also said that there is no placenta developed in my number of gestational age.

"" when i woke up, the first thing i noticed was i feel so light. i did not feel that i was nauseated anymore. though, my breasts are still sore and tender but my nausea was gone (even at the late afternoon, i never felt it). i did not vomit also. i still have my sensitive smell (but not that strong anymore) but my appetite was backi do not have any food aversions anymore and i can eat normally without feeling nauseated.

8:22 am - i took the 3rd dose. it was way past time than my actual time to take the 3rd dose (supposedly 2:45am) but i was fast asleep after i changed my pad. i did not hear my alarm, my partner was also tired and did not wake up from the said time. hence, i consulted WoW about this but i know they will reply a bit late so i asked here in this subreddit if i still should take the 3rd dose and they said yes. 

8:52 am - i swallowed the remains with water

9:15 am- i ate my breakfast; still bleeding; i still pass clots but not that big in my pad

9:30 am- started cramping again but was tolerable 5/10; i went my day normally. i just rested during the day

**FOURTH DOSE**

9:17 pm  - i pooped (not diarrhea just a typical poop sesh), then as i was pooping, i felt a big clot passed on me, though i did not saw how big it was but i felt it was big since when i woke up i was only passing smaller clots. i do not know what was that. 

9:20 pm - decided to take a bath, as i was washing down there, i saw that there was a clot hanging on me. i decided to pull it out gentlylike REALLY gently and slowly since its like a plug in my passageway (it occludes it). it was not painful. as i took it out, it was a long, thick, clot. i was really worried about this so i emailed WoW immediately then i decided to take the 4th dose of Misoprostol (this was the last dose that i took).

***today***: as i am writing this, WoW replied to my concern last night and they told me that i did the right thing by pulling the hanging clot gently and slowly. as per WoW, ***do not pull a hanging clot if its painful***

this ends my MA timeline. i am at my post MA day 3 as of today and still continues to bleed. i will test after 4 weeks, hoping to get a negative result. here are my questions:

"" can i say that my process sounds normal? that i shouldn't worry anything about it?

"" i read that post MA bleeding typically lasts for 4-6 weeks but as for me i am having a light bleeding now. its not spotting like but it is more light than the amount of blood i passed during my day 2 MA. is this normal? i can feel i can finish my bleeding for 5 days estimated. 

"" how long do sore breasts lasts? 

that is all! i am really thankful for all the women in this subreddit that helped me throughout my process. this subreddit still continues to help me now. i just wanted to say that you are not alone in this journey. i know it feels heavy and overwhelming, but please breathe  take it one step at a time. trust the process and trust yourself. its okay to feel scared, its okay to cryto grieve, but remember that you are strong and capable. keep reading, keep asking, and dont be afraid to reach out for help like i did. you will get through this, just like i did. were all here for each other d

I'm still grappling with the emotional aftermath of my medical abortion, which I underwent a few weeks ago. The procedure itself was a difficult decision, but what's been even harder is dealing with the guilt and longing that followed. Every time I see a baby, or a pregnant woman, I'm overcome with emotion. I cry because I want to have a child of my own, but I know that I'm not ready yet.

As a young woman, I have ambitions and goals that I want to achieve before becoming a mother. I'm determined to finish my college education and establish a stable career before taking on the responsibilities of parenthood. The thought of being a single mom, struggling to make ends meet and provide for my child, is a daunting one. I want to be able to give my future child the best possible life, and I don't feel ready to do that just yet.

Despite my best efforts to reassure myself that I made the right decision, the guilt and regret still linger. I worry that I've made a mistake, that I've given up the chance to be a mother to a child who would have brought me joy and fulfillment. But then I remind myself of why I made this choice in the first place: I want to be a good mother, a responsible and capable one, and I don't feel ready to take on that role just yet.

It's okay to acknowledge my feelings and to grieve the loss of a potential pregnancy. But I also need to focus on the future and the possibilities that lie ahead. I will continue to work towards my goals, to educate myself and to grow as a person. And when the time is right, I'll be ready to become a mother, to give my child the love, care, and support they deserve.

For now, I'll take things one step at a time, and I'll continue to heal and move forward. I'll remind myself that I'm not alone, that there are many women who have made similar choices and have gone on to live fulfilling lives. And I'll hold onto the hope that one day, I'll be ready to become the mother I aspire to be.","abortion",9,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jmfscm/abortion_aftermath/"

Its the second one Ive had, with a four-year difference between them. At the beginning I couldnt tell my parents about my pregnancy because the first time (when I was 18), they took it very, very badly, and I was scared that this second time (at 22), I would get the same reactionor even worse (for me), that they would force me to have the baby. So I faced the situation with my partner, and it worked out. It was at a clinic with good reviews, and I also got an IUD.

The thing is, I have an appointment with my gynecologist tomorrow, whom I hadnt seen since the abortion happened. I had gone to my follow-up appointments for the IUD check-up at the clinic where I had the procedure, but not with my gynecologist. Im afraid of being judged when I tell him I had another abortion. The gynecologist is very good and makes me feel comfortable, but Mexican society can be very closed-minded.

In the end, my parents did find out, but I made up a story that I had a miscarriage and thats why I had to go to the clinic. I plan to tell the gynecologist the same story, but what can I make up? What symptoms or situation could I invent to make my miscarriage story more believable?

Please dont judge methis is coming from someone who is afraid of being judged.","abortion",9,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jgvccq/help_i_need_to_invent_a_miscarriage_story/"

Miscarriage, abortion, medical trauma, graphic descriptions of bleeding, fainting, temporary vision loss, and emergency hospital care

TLDR:

I was scheduled for a surgical abortion this morning. Instead, I miscarried at home overnight, haemorrhaged roughly 2 pints of blood, blacked out, temporarily went blind, and spent 8 hours in emergency care. It was traumatic, unplanned, and not how this was supposed to go.

I want to preface this by saying I hate fear-mongering on Reddit. I love reading positive stories, and I fully agree that you mostly see horror stories here because people who have smooth experiences are just getting on with their lives. The squeaky wheels, as they say.

I even wrote a post years ago about coming off a tough antidepressant, just to offer a positive story and balance the scales a bit.

So when I found out I was pregnant  and that I was going to have a surgical abortion  I was mentally preparing to write a post just like that. A calm, reassuring story.

Ahh. The irony.

But I'm writing this the evening after everything went completely to hell  and Im okay. So heres what happened.

Last year, I skipped 8 periods in a row and was diagnosed with PCOS in November. After that, I only had two vaguely regular cycles before they stopped again.

It was a stressful time in general, and when I missed another period, I took a test on the day it was due  negative  and thought nothing of it.

About three weeks later, I was emotionally wrecked. Constant arguments with my boyfriend, napping all day, exhausted and disinterested in everything. Id gone off food, off activities  and then, one day, my boyfriend casually said, Youre glowing. We looked at each other. That night, while picking up dinner, I found myself sobbing in the Waitrose bathroom, holding a positive pregnancy test.

The next fortnight was hell. Id moved across the country, just started a new job, was living with my boyfriends parents in their one bathroom home (which is relevant to my decision) before we move into our house in a month  and now I was pregnant.

PCOS had made us fear infertility, so this pregnancy, even as ill timed as it was, messed with both our heads. We argued a lot, never over what was being done but our stress and sadness filtered into everything. It is really tricky as a woman having to undertake the decision, the physical effects of pregnancy (the nausea, sickness and the food aversions honestly destroyed me the past two weeks) and all the medical stuff whilst my boyfriend is sad but otherwise going on with his life - and with the best will in the world, its really difficult navigating this for the first time and feeling supported. At times I wondered if this would break us, but honestly I don't think anyone doesn't go through the trenches with this.

I spoke to MSI Reproductive choices (A UK abortion clinic) and opted for a surgical abortion at 9 weeks, for a few reasons. Firstly, one bathroom in the house, Id read up on medical abortions and I was at least convinced that I would want pretty free access to it and not feel horribly embarrassed. I also didnt fancy the potential pain, vomiting and passing out, nor the emotional part of having to be aware of the pregnancy passing. I want to note a friend of mine recently had a really successful medical abortion at 6 weeks, less painful than a normal period and day in bed. It could have been fine but I wanted an easy in and out situation. Aha. Ha. Haaaa.


I had my pre-assessment with MSI Reproductive Services a week later and then a further week before my scheduled abortion. I was honestly counting the hours until it was over. This was an hours drive away, but quick and easy. 

Two days before the procedure, I was meant to take mifepristone, a pill that stops pregnancy growth and softens the cervix. Its given before surgical abortion  and also used in medical abortion as the first step before taking the pills which actually expell the pregnancy.

I misread the instructions and took it on Friday instead of Saturday. Well, honestly, I didn't. I just convinced myself of the wrong date and was too anxious to double check.

I freaked out. But the MSI hotline reassured me that taking it 48 hours in advance was still within the normal range (some clinics have a 72-hour window), and worst case, I'd be given some extra meds on the day. The lady on the phone was incredibly reassuring claiming there was only a 1 in 1000 chance I might miscarry spontaneously before my surgery (a little more research found this is actually a pretty big understatement and it is much more likely than this 24-72 hours after taking it particularly if you are very hormone sensitive).

Saturday morning, my stomach was killing me. I had awful cramps all weekend but no spotting, so I went to sleep Sunday night thinking: By this time tomorrow, itll all be over.

At 1 a.m., I woke up knowing something was wrong. I had the spidey-sense of my period starting which woke me up.

Id bled through the sheet, mattress topper, and mattress. After smacking my boyfriend awake. I called the MSI hotline. The nurse said it was likely a miscarriage but not to worry unless I bled through 2 night pads in 2 hours. Shed check in every 30 minutes.

But I kept bleeding  gushing, passing kiwi-sized clots, filling pads every 15 minutes. Still, I felt okay, just anxious. Honestly in less pain than I had all weekend and I didn't feel that nauseous or faint. She continued to check in but despite asking me to monitor my bleeding by not sitting on the toilet, she said I needed to sit with my legs above hip height to stop the bleeding... Which umm.. didn't work and also prevented me accurately measuring how much I was bleeding.

The MSI nurse eventually said I could go to A&amp;E if I felt I needed to, but her advice about sitting with my legs up? It just made the blood pool and gush worse. I had no idea how much I was actually losing. And I was losing a lot. This is good advice if a patient is faint and not severely bleeding, but oh boy not good for me.

So I called 111, and they told me to go to A&amp;E. That felt right. I packed a bag. My boyfriend was amazing  calm, efficient, supportive. But I still thought: Im probably fine.

We got there fast. I was triaged, had bloods taken, bled through onto the gurney, and was sent to the waiting room with a giant pad.

While changing pads in the bathroom, I started to feel dizzy and tired with the effort, the cramping was worse and weirdly stinging. 

I put on a dressing down and sat with head buried in my boyfriends shoulder. We waited about 20 minutes and suddenly I got hot. Then the lights go bright and then I was pretty convinced I was going to pass out. I was slurring and told my boyfriend as I slipped down. He grabbed some attention as I frankly flopped around like a fish. I was half conscious and I threw up. As I retched, it felt like I was turning on a faucet, every contraction forcing something out of me. When I came too, I whispered to the nurse that was rolling her eyes she couldnt get a temperature that I either had bled over the seat or defacated myself (honestly I wasnt sure myself). She blanched.


Youre bleeding? My boyfriend who was bristling now explained I was having a miscarriage and had been sent for severe bleeding. The nurses asked if I had been seen. Yes. And why I had been sent back out. No idea. They disappeared and I was quickly shuffled to the majors room. My boyfriends hoodie wrapped around my dressing gown which yes, I had completely bled through, and the pad and onto the chair. 


I took some more pads, passed more lemon sized clots in their bathroom and was changed into a gown. 

Now Im not amazing with needles but for the fact I hadnt had any food or water for hours I did well, but the cannula really hurt more than bloods did. My boyfriend was actually incredible, and after today, all the crap from the past two weeks has been repaired by the fact he was an actual angel, distracting and comforting me through all procedures. He spoke to and hurried every doctor, was thoroughly informed, by my side, never disappearing and with no food or sleep himself still being a rock. 


A minute after the cannula was put in (no fluids yet), the world started tipping again. I went floppy, started retching and blacked out for a second. But when I came around I opened my eyes and& Nothing. Blackness. I had a major headache and I was blind. Id been holding it together but I freaked out, I dont know if I was talking or shouting about the fact that I couldnt see as two people stood me up, I could hear my boyfriend trying to calm me down but for a minute I thought I was going to die. I was being led somewhere and I was just trying to remember images and blink away the dark.
I was laid down on a bed and immediately the lights flipped on. Relief like that is immeasurable. 

 They explained my blood pressure had bottomed out from the blood loss  Id lost around 2 pints, about 30% of my blood volume.

They hooked me up to IV fluids, pain relief, and kept retesting my haemoglobin to see if I needed a transfusion but I stayed above the level.

I was cold, shaky, and exhausted, curled in a bay with my boyfriend talking half nonsense and trying to stay awake and ignore the pain from the cannula but finally starting to feel safer.

By 8:30 a.m., I passed a large, liver-like clot (possibly the placenta), and the bleeding slowed.

But I still wasnt done. I was sent to gynaecology to check if the miscarriage was complete.

The doctor who came in was lovely, and I still hadnt cried or anything. She did a speculum examination which was the only thing I asked my boyfriend to leave for which in hindsight I wish I hadnt. For some reason the pain from it and level of invasiveness just broke me. I had been prodded and poked, hemorrhaged, embarrassed, blinded. And now it was being explained I would possibly have to have the surgery anyway, which if I wanted the general anaesthetic (which I did, I couldnt fathom in my state having my cervix numbed and being awake for it) that it would be the next day. I was having all of the worst options happen and I crumbled into bits.

In the maternity teams defense, they were absolutely lovely with me and my boyfriend through this. He then came with me to get scanned, inside and out, and I realised lying there staring dead at the ceiling that if I had the local surgery unprepared in my current state I would possibly leave quite emotionally scarred. They confirmed my worst fear that not all the pregnancy was out. However it turned out this is actually common, I could still go home and it would likely pass naturally within the week safely, if I didnt want to have surgery. 

 Surgery was an option  but since bleeding had slowed and I was stable, they said it would likely pass naturally in a few days.

I chose to go home.

I got home, got in bed, and finally slept. I woke up feeling light  still sore and weak, but like I was slowly returning to myself. No more nausea. No more aversion to food. No more haze.

Happier actually than I have felt in weeks.

I dont know exactly why this happened. Maybe the early dose of mifepristone triggered it. Maybe my body was already unstable from the PCOS. Maybe just bad luck.

But I do know this:

You should never lose this much blood during a miscarriage at 89 weeks.

If you bleed through two large pads in 2 hours, go to A&amp;E.

If you're cramping hard after mifepristone  even without taking misoprostol  you might be miscarrying. Be ready.

If you feel dizzy, faint, or out of it  you need help, not to be sitting with your legs elevated waiting for it to stop.

Pack a hospital bag. Know who youd call. And if you're alone and something doesnt feel right  dont wait. You're better uncomfortable at the hospital than unconscious on your bathroom floor.

I dont have a neat abortion story. I dont even know how to end this. But I hope this helps someone, somehow  to feel less alone, to know whats normal and whats not, or to push for help when something is wrong. Whilst miscarrying early with any type of abortion is a likelihood I think many should be more aware of, hemorrhaging isn't. If you miscarry after taking Mife, you're very likely to be absolutely fine. 

Please take care of yourselves. This was traumatic. But Im home and healing and in many ways actually feel a lot better. I will be reaching out to discuss with my GP and possibly have a chat with a professional about the experience, it was off kilter and there is no shame in it. There are many free resources for this - Please use them!

i posted recently asking for supportive and kind words as i go through this decision. long story short, i found out i was pregnant a week ago, just a few days before my partner would be deployed for several months. 

theres many reasons someone may regret their abortion, but i knew long before this happened that, if it ever DID happen, i wouldnt be able to bring myself to abort. my partner, on the other hand, knew that thats what i would need to do if i ever did fall pregnant. 
we did what we could to try to avoid it, and after many months of thinking we were safe, we finally hit a point where we werent. 

i love and care for him so much, i only want whats best for him and i never want to get in the way of him achieving his dreams. when we went to get a test at the doctors to confirm, i let him know that i dont want him to build resentment for whatever choice i make and thats when he told me ""i dont think you should keep it."" im trying my best to be kind but now there is a resentment within ME. 
when my mom asked what we were gonna do, he even said he told me he'd support me in whatever choice i make. this is wrong, he never said that. just ""i dont think you should keep it."" its rung through my head since he said it. 

heartbroken. i am heartbroken.
for so long i prayed that the universe would somehow send me a baby, because that is the only thing that would genuinely get me to keep myself in line. if ever my period is even one day overdue, i talk myself through everything i would do to own up, work hard, and prepare so that i would bring a baby into the world and it never have a single worry. 

i keep telling myself this was the right thing to do, over and over again for the past week. but really, at the bare bones and if im being absolutely completely honest, its only the right thing to do by other people. by my mom, who i still live with. by my partner, who isnt ready yet and would be away until roughly my due date if not longer. but if im looking out for so many people, who is going to look out for me? i think my lesson has been learned.

all this to say, if you come to this subreddit and youre feeling the same way, just know that you know yourself best. not every family is perfect, sometimes theres bumps in the road, but youre ultimately the only one who can determine if you can be able to handle that or not. dont do something you know that you dont want to. 

and if youre also feeling the same way and HAVE gone through with it already, just know that youre not alone, youre not the only one. i hope the pain eases for all of us, regardless of our reasons.

He told me to call them when Im less out of it. I did and they told me to come back to get it when the medication wears off. 

Im back home and now Im having butt cramps and its kinda hard to sit on the couch. Is that normal? Would that go away? And before the abortion, they gave me a pad to put on my underwear (I dont remember who put my pants and underwear back on me). It was a lot on it but after changing it at home the bleeding is now light. Also my nausea went away. I guess the nausea medication they gave me through the IV worked. 

I thought I would be upset and have regrets about the abortion like in my other post but surprisingly Im okay. I was 9 weeks 0 days pregnant. Im also very grateful towards my partner. Although I dont remember much, I do remember him rubbing my back in the car while I was crying and possibly embarrassing myself. 

I hope my recovery goes well and someday Ill be ready to be the best mom I could be. And thank you to everyone on here for being a safe place for me to talk/vent about this. It made me feel not alone in this because besides my cousin and my partner, no one knows I was pregnant and got an abortion.","abortion",6,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1k0570w/just_had_an_abortion_today/"

I was very scared and nervous but I knew that being a mom wasn't a good decision for me. I live check to check and the person I was dating broke up with me before I found out. The state I live in isn't legal so I had to find somewhere out of state. The closest place was 8 hours away. I was miserable the entire 10 weeks I was pregnant. My body was fighting against me, I was always throwing up, my boobs and face were so swollen. I couldn't sleep at night and my sides and back were always in pain. I chose Overland Park, KS for my appointment. I chose the SA because the pills scared me honestly. The guy I was dating and I spent the night there and my appointment was on 3/29. When I first got there of course there were protesters outside and it did kind of effect my mood. There was a sweet volunteer who escorted me in. The wait was a bit long but there were a lot of women there that day. The staff were very nice and accommodating and made the process a lot easier. I felt safe and comfortable enough to ask a lot of questions. They were patient with me and made sure I knew all of my options from BC to sedation. When I received my meds before the procedure my stomach started cramping so bad. When it was time I did get nervous and started crying in the procedure room because I had gotten so scared. It was so cold and scary in there. The nurse was so kind and asked me was I sure and told me everything was going to be okay. Once she gave me sedation I didn't feel or remember anything until they were offering me cheezitz and sprite lol. I did opt in to see my ultrasound and I asked for a picture to take home. The overall experience was not bad at all. Very minimal pain. I am one day post opt and I will admit I am going through a range of emotions. My bleeding was light afterwards and I barely had cramping. I know my mental recovery will be a long journey but I know I made the best decision for me. To anyone who has experienced an abortion or planning to, know that it is 100% your choice! I did not think about anyone else because those 10 weeks I spent in pain and by myself no one thought about me. Maybe one day when the time is right I will have a child, or maybe not. d","abortion",2,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jnlovg/my_experience/"

i feel very very lucky to live somewhere where this can be done, and to have a bf who drove me to and from my appt. i made it entirely over the phone, and just had to go to kaiser (who i luckily have insurance with) to get bloodwork done beforehand. i wanted to do the pills at first as they seemed more discrete and simple, but the idea of the pain with the second pill scared me and i also liked the idea of potentially getting an IUD placed at an in-person appointment, and was able to get that all done the next week. at my appt, there was a good amount of waiting around, but i essentially did a urine sample, ultrasound, took some ibuprofen and vallium, waiting for the meds to kick in, and went through the procedure. they said i was about 5 weeks along so it was very early. the doctors who completed my procedure were extremely kind to talk to me through it and let me know when things might get a bit painful, that i was doing a good job, etc. it took around 10-15 min (i think). afterwards, i spent just a bit of time in a recovery room until they released me back to my bf who drove me home, and then i slept for a hot while. 

everyone i spoke to was helpful and i feel very grateful for their kindness; this is how the world should be, and i'm sorry to anyone who isn't able to have that experience. abortions are our choice and it sucks how it can feel so difficult to make decisions amongst angrier voices. some of it was painful and a bit scary, and also my cramps from the IUD suck right now, but overall i'm just feeling grateful. i'm 20, in college, and live with my parents who have thankfully not found out about anything. i wish anyone who is going through similar experiences the very best of luck and all my love and support. also, if you have any questions or thoughts, let me know! &lt;33","abortion",6,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jhppro/f20_sharing_my_relatively_positive_abortion/"

"954",954,"Abortion Regret","2025-03-28",1743133258,"Abortion Regret","I 32f) had an abortion in January and I deeply regret it. My boyfriend (32M) and I had been dating for about 6 months when I found out. I was in disbelief when I found out as I didnt plan on having kids for another 3-4 years, but honestly I became pretty excited as I knew I wanted kids eventually and Ive always been a little nervous about infertility with my pcos. I was terrified to tell my boyfriend as we werent in the most perfect place, but things were improving and we had said we were committed to working on things. 

He absolutely panicked when I told him. Hyperventilated, cried, said fuck no over and over while getting drunk. I was scared too but my feelings got completely pushed aside and the entire situation was about him. He begged me to get an abortion and gave minimal thought into the option of keeping it, despite knowing that I was leaning on the side of keeping it. He wouldnt even hold my hand during the ultrasound or give me any comfort. 

He isnt as financially stable as I am and I think he is kind of going through a mid life crisis so it was going to be a really hard transition for him which he said he was not ready for. 
After about a week of considering, I ended up going through with the pills as I thought hed hate me and resent me forever if I kept the baby. I thought the abortion would take some pressure off him and that we could fix the things in our relationship with more time.

The abortion was the worst experience of my life. The pain was unbearable for about 15 hours. I couldnt get comfortable and threw up twice. I took probably 5 hot baths, laid with a heating pad, and took Advil regularly and some opioids I had from an accident in the past. The bleeding was traumatizing. It felt nothing like a period, but actually like I was feeling a child being ripped from my insides and spewed out of me. I was an absolute mess. The pain started to improve a bit the next day, but lingered for another two weeks. 

I couldnt go 5 hours without crying, part of which I think was mood swings and the other part was fear of regretting it. It took about 5-6 weeks for the mood swings to resolve, and I finally stopped bleeding at 8 weeks. 

My boyfriend broke up with me after 2 weeks post abortion so that has made matters even worse. Ive been a wreck wondering what my child would have been like and thinking about how great of a mother I could have been even without him in my life. 
Now I just found out my sister is pregnant and Im trying my best to be excited for her, but honestly it just makes me even more sad that I terminated mine. 

I am absolutely pro abortion for anyone who is sure that it is the right choice for them. I completely understand that every situation is different, and it is 100% your choice. As a woman in my 30s with good financial stability, strong family support, and a desire to be a mom someday I have now realized that someday should have been now. I should have never let his opinion and begging persuade me. I hope one day I can come to terms with this decision, and get the opportunity to be pregnant and become a mom again.

"956",956,"My Surgical Abortion Experience at 6 Weeks","2025-03-19",1742353454,"My Surgical Abortion Experience at 6 Weeks","Hi everyone!! I wanted to share my experience from my SA today, as I did a lot of research and reading here on Reddit before my procedure.

First off, I want to be honest and tell you that I was absolutely terrified in the week leading up to the procedure. I was so incredibly nervous. If youre scared and anxious about your procedure and dont know what to expect  youre not alone and I totally feel you. You will come across positive and negative stories, so I hope that mine can give you some clarity and reassurance about what to expect& just remember that everyones experiences are different.

For background, this was my (25F) first pregnancy. I found out I was pregnant shortly after 4 weeks. My partner and I do want to have a family in the near future, but for us, it came down to timing. We both knew that terminating this pregnancy was a sacrifice we wanted to make in order to ensure our future family had more stability and that we were more prepared.

I chose SA over MA because I wanted to minimize the time and pain of the process. I also wanted to leave my appointment knowing that the procedure was successful.

I do want to share that was a very emotional decision for me and I felt a lot of mixed emotions and grief leading up to the procedure. I want so badly to be a mother and I honestly really enjoyed being pregnant. Im excited to one day experience pregnancy again when were ready and to bring our baby into the world when its time. I read somewhere that the right decision can be a hard one to make. This gave me a lot of comfort throughout my pregnancy and abortion process.

Honestly, this has been the most difficult thing Ive experienced in my entire life& to make this decision and to go this overwhelming process. It is physically, mentally, and emotionally exhausting. However, I do not regret the decision I made. 



OKAY, now onto the part you actually want to hear about:

My partner took me to my appointment and stayed in the waiting room until my procedure was complete. To receive sedation, youre typically required to have a driver.

My appointment was at 10:00am. Upon entering the clinic, I was checked in and given paperwork to fill out. We were advised upon entering that it could be a long day. The estimate upon arrival was a 6-hour day, but I got lucky and had a relatively fast day.

Around 10:15, I was called back for my ultrasound. I was measured at 5w5d. Since it was so early, I did have to receive an abdominal and vaginal ultrasound& no biggie! Immediately after this, they brought me into another room where they reviewed my medical history, checked my blood pressure, heart rate, and gave me 600mg of ibuprofen along with an antibiotic as a precaution for any potential infection. I was then brought into a private room for an educational session. We discussed the procedure itself, what to expect during, and went over the expected recovery process. I was given the chance to ask questions and was asked my preference for sedation and lidocaine. The highest level of sedation offered was moderate sedation (or twilight sedation) which in this case was a mix of pain medication and anti-anxiety medication administered through an IV. With this method, you are awake for the procedure. I asked for the moderate sedation and requested lidocaine to numb my cervix  although it came out more like I will take anything and everything you have please lol

These notes were added to my chart and I was taken back to the waiting room at around 11:30, where I was asked to provide payment. I was told they would call my name when it was my turn and that Id be brought to another floor for the actual procedure.

I was expecting to wait longer, but at around 12:20, my name was called. I was taken to another floor and asked to undress from the waist down and wrap a blanket around my waist while waiting. At about 12:40, I was brought back to the procedure room. The nurses took my vitals and placed my IV. They were so sweet and reassuring. I was vocal about being scared and they told me that it was totally normal and that theyd be by my side the entire time. After getting situated on the table and in the stirrups, two doctors came in. They were SO sweet as well. They walked me through how the procedure would go and warned me that Id most likely feel some intense discomfort and heavy cramping. They told me the most important thing was to focus on my breathing and not move my hips during the procedure. While they were talking to me, the nurse must have pushed the pain meds and anti-anxiety because I immediately felt fuzzy. Everything slowed down and I felt much more relaxed. It was a little disorienting at first, but I felt soooo much better. Very grateful this option was offered at this clinic. 

The two doctors then told me that they would start the procedure. They inserted the speculum and I felt four injections to my cervix, which was the lidocaine. The injections were not painful at all, just four little pinches. Then they used a tool to dilate my cervix and began suctioning. This is when the cramping started.  It was intense towards the end, but not nearly as bad as I had anticipated. One of the nurses held my hand and I focused really hard on my breathing. Before I knew it, I heard the doctor say Okay! Youre all done!. The process didnt take more than 5 minutes and the meds made me feel like it was just a very crampy 30 seconds. I was relieved and surprised at how quick it was. They finished with a quick vaginal ultrasound to verify that they got everything and inserted a sterile tampon that they would check before I left to monitor bleeding. 

For me, the most uncomfortable part was immediately after  heavy cramping from the procedure and feeling very lightheaded/nauseous. I was helped into a wheelchair and taken to the recovery room. I was put in a recliner and given a warm blanket with a heating pad. I asked for a cold towel to put on my forehead, which helped tremendously. They also told me that I had unusually low blood pressure in recovery, so that could explain my lightheadedness and nausea. I was given sprite, water, and crackers. I was accompanied to the bathroom, where a nurse inspected my tampon and I was given a pad to wear home.

When initially asked about my pain level as I was wheeled out to the recovery room, I said I was feeling a 7/10. A few minutes later, I was at a 2/10 and ready to go home. The discomfort/pain didnt last more than 10 minutes overall (procedure and recovery combined). The other women I sat with all reported having under a 4/10 pain level like no big deal, so maybe Im just a baby lol. 
They made sure I was good to go and called my boyfriend downstairs to pick me up. I was in the car on the way home by 1:20.

Its now 9:00pm and I feel great. I have some veryyyy mild cramping... but its seriously nothing. I feel SO much better than I did before the procedure and I feel so much more relief than I expected. 



Dont let your nerves get the best of you. Today felt SO easy and I cant believe how worried I made myself about the whole thing. I would recommend this procedure to anyone in a similar situation and would choose this route all over again. 

Yes, this can feel scary and overwhelming... but remember that youre making a decision thats right for you and youre in good hands with the reproductive health providers helping you. Our bodies can do incredible things and YOU CAN DO THIS!!! 

I tried to be as detailed as possible, so I apologize for all the info. Please feel free to ask me any questions or message me d

Dear Eva,

Tomorrow was supposed to be the day I met you.

Ive thought about this day so many timeswondering what it would have been like to hold you, to see your little face, to call you by your name. I never knew for sure if you were a girl, but in my heart, I always believed you were. And I loved the name Eva for you. It felt right. You felt real to me.

When you were growing inside me, I was so sick. It was hard, but now, sometimes I find myself missing even the nauseabecause that meant you were there. With me. And I would go through it all again just to feel that closeness once more.

The decision I made was one of the hardest Ive ever faced. Ive asked God for forgiveness, and He has held me through it. I find peace in knowing that you are with Him nowin heaven, safe and whole. That you are my guardian angel, watching over me. That gives my heart comfort, even when the sadness feels too big.

I want you to know, Eva, that you were never unloved. You were never unwanted. You were carried with love, thought of with hope, and remembered with deep, deep tenderness. You changed me. You made me a mother. And I will always be your mom.

Your dad loves you very much, too. We both carry you in our hearts. We may not have held you in our arms, but we hold you in our souls. Always.

Tomorrow, I will light a candle for you. Ill talk to you in my heart and send you all my love. Youll forever be a part of memy little girl in heaven, my angel, my Eva.

With all my love,

More context: this was definitely unplanned and unexpected. My ex wants nothing to do with it and family wants an abortion. Theres a voice in the back of my head telling me that I shouldnt abort, telling me that having a baby will bring me infinite joy despite the challenges. Problem is, I still dont know if I have the ability to this all alone. I dont know why I dont want an abortion. Ive spent almost two months trying to with this out with a therapist but it hasnt helped

Edit: I realize my post is not super clear. I realize that pro choice doesnt mean pro abortion. I know it means that its supporting women making the choice to have a baby or not. I just want to know the logical reasons, barring the typical religious/political arguments, why would someone who is going through an unplanned pregnancy, but not in the perfect situation keep a pregnancy when abortion makes the the problem go away","abortion",29,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jqdql8/why_would_a_prochoice_person_not_get_an_abortion/"

Just had my LO back in Feb 24' &amp; it's been such a journey learning how to be a parent. This was my first baby (to be born) &amp; I always joked about 1 &amp; done. Mid March came around, I'm late. But I'm EBF, so I didn't think too much of it. 
Started to think man, this pre period bloat is wild. Nope, took the test, came back positive instantly. I was already like 6.5w along. I instantly felt annoyed, stupid, defeated. Just started to get my pink back, my body has started to level back out (after gaining 50lbs during pregnancy I was 5lbs away from pre baby) and I realized; I can't do this. 
My body's still not mine as I'm breastfeeding constantly, kid barley eats solid go figure. 

I drove 70 miles that day to get an appt to do the abortion. Got to the appt, couldn't go through with it. 
Drove back home. Realized, I should've gone through with it. 
So , back down the mountain I go. 
I took the first pill, and instantly felt relieved, sad, and a little heartbroken. 
I know it was just an embryo, but all the ifs &amp; what's hit me. 'What would this baby look like' 'how much would I look like it's sibling' 'am I changing fate' 'I can handle two'

But in reality, I wasn't ready to handle two under two. I wasn't ready to sacrifice my body again. I wasn't ready to have less time with my first born. I just wasn't ready. 
And that's okay. 

Mixed emotions are, well, hard to succumb to. What side to choose, what's the right thing for you. 

But i did what was right for me. 
I'm almost a week post pill(s) 
And I'm continuing on with my daily routine. Feeling guilty here and there. But we just weren't ready. My husband either. Bless his heart, he's supportive asl, but I knew he wasn't ready either. 

My rant has a message;
Do what's right for you. Always.
The tree won't produce apples, if you don't care for it correctly. Remember that. Stay strong. Things will come how they're supposed to.

I had a MA on 3/17 (4w4d) and it's been a ride since then. I went into the PP office and I was too early on for them to see anything in the sonogram, after some advisories and scary information, the doctor said we could proceed with the MA but warned me that the potential for an etopic pregnancy could not be ruled out at this point. I didn't want to wait. My bf and I were on the same page, he was so supportive but ultimately it wasn't the right time for me. I just got a promotion at work, we don't live together and we have been together (lovingly and happily) for less than a year. I felt guilty but proceeded anyways. After I took the first pill, I was relieved. We already had a vacation planned for this weekend so it felt like I could just get it done early in the week and wrap up the experience before we flew out. So I followed through with the second round of pills on 3/18, had aggressive cramping but ultimately not too different from my day 2 period pains (with the help of pain meds which i usually don't take). On 3/20 I had my follow up to measure if my hcg levels were dropping. on 3/17 I was at 319, then as I board the plane on 3/21 I got a call stating that I have to go to the emergency room because instead of decreasing, my levels rose to 490. An etopic pregnancy was looming. It is life threatening and I had to be seen to rule this out.

The plane takes off and ultimately, we knew we would have to turn this around. I couldn't relax, I couldn't enjoy myself (understandably), I felt like a ticking time bomb. I felt like my body betrayed me. My bf was so supportive and wasn't angry at all (which the ptsd in me feared). We stood a day and came back today, went straight to the emergency room. After hours of guessing, trying to rule things out, and 6 tubes of blood tests later - my levels came in at 43. which signifies a successful MA at this point. The doctors explained that this is because the pills force the uterus to contract but as long as there is tissue in there, hcg levels will increase until you fully expel the tissue. Which I guess didn't happen for me until well after the initial (and expected) 24 hrs post misoprostol.

I wanted to share this story because despite my type A personality, I am still learning I can't control everything. This was what my first experience was, feeling anxious, nervous, worried all in all. Even through thinking I had it all under control and all planned out even when an unexpected pregnancy happened. I also want to highlight that no amount of googling or online research can tell you EXACTLY why things are happening the way they are in your own body. My experience is not very common or textbook, and that uncertainty drove me up a wall. I'm happy that ultimately I am okay, but the guilt still looms a bit as I continue to bleed right now. I find myself with feelings of relief but also, ""what ifs"" and wondering what could have been if I decided to say yes. What they would've looked like or sounded like.

I scheduled the abortion that day, I knew we were done, I knew I did not want to bring his child into this world because I know he would take it across the world to his parents if he got the chance and I would never see it again and it would be a mess. He proposed to me while I was ending things, with the ring we had picked out together before I realized how manipulative he truly was.

My decision wasnt easy and Ive come to almost regret it. Not a day goes by when I dont think about it and how selfish it was. 

I had to tell my sister I decided not to keep the baby and she shamed me. Told me I was selfish, that we were cowards. She was pregnant at the time and she just had her baby yesterday. 

We joked with her that her baby looked like a Pixar character and she replied by saying I would never even know what my baby wouldve looked like. I think that was it for me. 

After my abortion she asked me not to talk about me and my boyfriends intimacy or make jokes about sex with her, even though she was always the one priding into our intimate lives. 

But she continued to make jokes about my abortion and make Jabs such as the one I listed above. Without reasonable provocation. Ive done nothing but support her in anything she did without judgement. All through her pregnancy I was her biggest supporter. I set up her gender reveal, went to her appointments, set a welcome home event after she had her baby. 

After my abortion I acted like I was fine whenever she asked. I knew if I told her how I really felt she would say I deserve it and tell me that I have no right to feel anything I do because of the choice I made.

I found this place in Chicago since I live in a red state and it was about 2 hrs away from me. They nurses were so sweet to me when I was crying because I was overwhelmed. I originally thought I was 7 weeks pregnant but during my ultrasound it said 5weeks2days and for some reason that made me feel better. There was no heartbeat which also made me feel better for some reason. I took the mifepristone they gave me at 4pm Chicago time (5pm my time). It felt no side effect besides cramping here and there but nothing major.

Hi everyone! I wasnt going to share my MA experience originally because I feel like I got lucky, but maybe this positive experience will help others. I received the pills from ABuzz for $150, took the first pill around 9pm on 3/20. 

I spent days reading other stories on here about how horrendous the process was. I was terrified. I stocked up on Gatorade, Ibuprofen, bought wrap around heating pads, set up my bed with towels, and slapped on a massive overnight pad. 


3/21 

5:00pm - The time to take the 4 pills came and I inserted them vaginally to avoid throwing them up after throwing up the ibuprofen. (Thankfully I was able to get the 800mg ibuprofen down about half an hour later) Keep in mind that taking the pills vaginally isnt recommended if you live in a state with strict abortion laws. Residue can be detected in the vagina if you were to go to the hospital. I do live in a red state, but our abortion laws are surprisingly not strict. 

7:00pm - I laid in bed for two hours by this point with on and off pressure in my uterine area, nothing really painful though. The wrap around heating pad definitely helped. I got up to use the restroom and felt a tiny pop sensation and this is when the bleeding began. A clot came out that included all the pills not fully dissolved. I was worried maybe they wouldnt work, but after some searching on here I learned this could happen but still be effective as long as I laid down for 30 minutes after inserting them. 

7:30pm - Some stronger cramps came along, but still nothing worse than a period cramp. I slept on and off through them honestly. 

8:30pm - Woke up after a small nap and took another trip to the bathroom. Felt a large clot slide out (very uncomfortable honestly) and after taking a peek into the toilet I noticed it was the pregnancy passing. The tissue was a weird pale purple color surrounded by the large red clot. Id say it was about the length of a lemon as a whole and the purple tissue was the size of a half dollar coin from what I could see. 

From this point on I had weak cramps, quarter to dime sized clots, and a blood flow similar to a period. My pads never got filled but I did keep up with changing them every 2-3 hours just for my own comfort purposes. I kept up with the ibuprofen, but dialed it back to 400mg to get me through the night. 

Today has been smooth so far. I still have mild cramping and bleeding which is surprisingly not as bad as my usual period (I have severe cramping and large clots with my period). My nausea/morning sickness has decreased significantly and I finally got to enjoy a full breakfast for the first time in two weeks! 

I feel incredibly lucky to have an easy process and hope this can ease some nerves of others. Of course be prepared!! Every body is different. It is much better to be over-prepared rather than under-prepared.

We were pretty honest with each other about aborting him but the closer and closer our appointment got we felt more and more anxious about it. We were always open that if one of us wanted to change our minds we would talk about it. Up until we were waiting to get into the operating room, we both were kinda grateful it took forever to get to us. Weve always wanted kids. We love taking care of kids. But up until we were both in the operating room and I was sitting next to her while it happened, I couldnt help but cry. I cried because I felt bad she was going through this pain, but I also cried because we both loved living in this dream that we have a baby together. But after the abortion, she felt empty and the guilt washed right over her. And it washed over me too. I sat at home and cried and cried. We loved him. And we were doing it out of love because of the situation we were in. Neither of us were ready for parenthood but both of us had a part of us that wanted to try for him anyway. Shes living with her extremely catholic parents, Im living with my grandmother, I work barely part time and she works a full time job. And there was no way that if we kept him things would get better but only worse for him. My gf wouldve been kicked out of the house and jobless bcuz her job is directly connected to her home life, her dad works directly with her, and my grandma wouldnt let me have her stay even if we didnt have a baby together. Im a Christian myself. I believe that our baby is in a better place. I believe he knew that we loved him and cared for him. And loved him so much that he wouldnt have to suffer a painful life so we ended it before it started. I know he understands that. But what gets to me is my mother. My mother passed when I was only 12. (Im 23, my gf is 21) and my mom had me when she was 19. She was an addict, homeless, jobless, no support, yet, she did everything she could to give me a proper chance at life. And yet, I couldnt do the same for our baby and my gf couldnt either. I can just feel this pit in my stomach that we made the wrong decision. But when I keep bouncing back to we did the right thing to we made a mistake I always keep running into the wall of, how are we going to raise our child ? How are we supposed to when wed both be homeless and jobless ? 

Idk. It just breaks my heart to think that maybe this was the only chance we had at having a baby, having a family, and its gone. It took her 3 yrs of no protection to even get pregnant (weve been dating for 6yrs) and Im afraid that was the only chance we had. And she feels the same way. But I have to keep reminding us that there was no way we couldve given what our baby boy deserved in life with impossible circumstances. I have to keep telling myself that we did it out of love, not selfishness. Because in all we did, we loved him so much that we ended his pain before it started. 

Were looking into going to my therapist about it and have a professional give us a way to talk about it. 

We just wish that we had the chance to give him the life he deserves. We wished that we werent in this circumstance to not have him. And I think about what my mom would say and my mom would say we made the right decision. And we were afraid that we would never be forgiven. But talked to my priest and he told me that God knew the weight on our shoulders and hearts. God knew that we had to make an impossible decision that no parent should have to make. God knows that we were given circumstances beyond our control and ability and we put every ounce of thought into making that decision and that Jesus still loves us and is taking care of our son along with my mother. And told me that our son understands why we did what we had to do, not of selfishness but of love and only love and he knows that and forgives us. 

I guess Im just coming here to rant and vent but also ask for advice. How can I help my gf with this pain and grief and how can I help myself with this pain and grief ?

Scrolling through this community helped me so much, and I'm so grateful it exists &lt;3 

I had suspected I was pregnant a few weeks ago after developing some weird food aversions and mild nausea. I was terrified to take the test... I convinced myself that I had caught some virus. But when the symptoms didn't go away, I peed on the stick. Immediate positive. Even though I had my suspicions that I was *maybe* pregnant, those double lines were a cold, hard dose of reality. My first thought was ""how can I get out of this situation without telling anyone??"". I was so embarrassed. If you're reading this and are having similar thoughts, please know that there's absolutely nothing to be embarrassed about. Getting pregnant accidentally is **normal**, seeking an abortion is **normal.** And reading though this sub will remind you that you aren't alone. I deduced that I was probably between 8-9 weeks along. No wonder I had been feeling sick for weeks.

It was never a question for me whether I would choose to terminate or not. I'm in a long-term relationship with someone I plan to spend my life with, but neither of us are ready for a child right now. After a quick cry over the phone to my mom, I immediately went onto Planned Parenthood's website and was able to secure an appointment for a surgical (procedure) abortion for the next morning. I'm not sure that this is the case for all locations, but for me, getting the appointment was as easy as entering some personal information and selecting a time slot. No need to talk to anyone on the phone! The whole process took me 30 seconds. 

My appointment was at 11am the next morning. I knew I was going to choose to receive moderate sedation during the procedure, so I had my bestie with me for moral support and to drive me home. We arrived about 10 minutes early, and went through a quick security check before entering the building. Every single staff member I interacted with, including the security guards, were THE NICEST. They immediately put me at ease. I checked in, signed some forms, and was sent to hang out in the waiting room until someone could take me back. After about 10 minutes, a medical assistant came to bring me in for my ultrasound. They asked me if I would like to know how far along I was, if there were multiple fetuses, if I would like to see the ultrasound, or if I would like to take a picture of it home. I said no to all of the above. The ultrasound took maybe all of 5 minutes (it was on my abdomen, not vaginal). The assistant then led me to a room to chat with a counselor about my options for the procedure (she asked me if I was safe at home, if anyone was pressuring me, etc.). She had me watch a quick video about the procedure and my medication options, and I had the opportunity to ask questions. After that, I went back out into the waiting room until a doctor was available to do the actual procedure. 

I waited for a longgggg time until someone was ready for me. But the waiting room was nice and quiet - they had ginger ale, saltines, and mints available, and had HGTV on the television. Once it was my turn, they brought me back and gave me an oral antibiotic, oral ibuprofen (800mg), and IV zofran (anti-nausea). I waited a bit for that to kick in, and then they led me to the procedure room. From here things are fuzzy... the doctor came in and explained the procedure a bit (she told me that I was brave, and that I was going to do great), and reassured me that abortion is **safe.** They administered the sedation, and the whole thing was over in a blink. I remember feeling slight pressure, but no pain. I decided to have an IUD put in at the same time, which added no time at all to the procedure. Two birds with one stone!

A nurse helped me back to the recovery room where I was given a heating pad, a blanket, some ginger ale, and snacks. They went and brought my friend back to sit with me. I felt woozy for about 10 minutes, but after that I was back to normal. I had some cramping, about what I would expect with a moderate period. I think I rated it a 2.5/10. After 15 minutes, the nurse had me check my pad to see how much I was bleeding (not a lot at all!), and told me I could get dressed and head home! Start to finish, I was at the clinic for 4 hours, which was what they tell you to prepare for. I had some moderate cramping in the evening once the ibuprofen had worn off, but by this morning the cramping was gone. 

I can't tell you how much I *feel like myself* now, 24 hours later. It's like when you try glasses on for the first time, and realize you've been seeing everything blurry without realizing it. My nausea is gone, I have my energy back, I can eat the foods I like again.

I had my TMFR via the Hope Clinic in Illinois last week. This is my experience. Maybe it can shed some light and answer some questions for individuals having to make the hardest decision of their lives like me. I called the Hope clinic on a Friday and was able to get an appointment for the coming Tuesday. They gave me pricing over the phone based on how far along I was and general information like how long the procedure was expected to take (days) and acceptable clothing and what not. The Monday prior to my procedure, the doctor (who would be performing the procedure) called me to ask general medical history and answer any questions I may have. This really put me at ease because, one it was a woman going to perform the procedure, and two she showed compassion and empathy during the phone call and that says a lot. 

My husband and I drove in from out of state the day prior and arrived at the clinic on time for the appointment. Of course there are protesters but they are not allowed in the parking lot. They yell from the sidewalk and try to offer help and solutions not knowing no solution is available for the severe skeletal dysplasia my baby has. There are women in rainbow vests and carry rainbow umbrellas who are clinic escorts to guide you to the clinic and shield you from the protesters. After checking with security you are let into the building. The staff were extremely nice and courteous. After completing paperwork, I was in the waiting area for maybe ten minutes before I was called to the back to complete an ultrasound for measurements and to confirm dating. After the ultrasound your hemoglobin is checked via a pin prick to your finger to make sure you are not anemic. You are given Flagyl and Ibuprofen prior to being placed in a therapeutic room for an in depth conversation with the educator to discuss what is to be expected with the procedure and after care STEP by STEP. The Flagyl and Ibuprofen is in preparation for the laminaria dilator insertion. The educator is really nice. The conversation is so detailed that it lasts about a good 30 mins. Because my termination was for medical reasons, they offered to create a memory box with fingerprints and footprints. I declined as with the skeletal dysplasia, that wouldnt be possible for me. You pay your fees with the cashier in this room and then wait to be called for the dilator insertion in the preop area. 

Of course you are wheeled to the operating room and the legs go up in stirrups. Prior to the dilator insertion, I asked the doctor to be gentle and protect my uterus as much as possible to make future pregnancies possible. The dilator insertion is not pleasant at all. With this being my first pregnancy, my cervix never experienced dilation. Although local anesthetic was given directly to my cervix, honestly it didnt help. The nurses held my hands and gave words of encouragement until it was over. After the dilator insertion then comes the digoxin shot& this was reality that there was no turning back. Again, I was 22 weeks along so this was necessary. The shot was uncomfortable but not as much as the dilator insertion. I had an amniocentesis the day prior so I was kinda prepared. I was given bottles of Ibuprofen and Tylenol with Codiene to back to the hotel for overnight pain relief. Written instructions and emergency contact is given for emergencies overnight. 

I had to return to the clinic the next morning at 8:30 am. They made it clear if you are not dilated enough that another round of dilators maybe inserted and you would have to return to the clinic the next day. I prayed my cervix was ready because I dont think I could have handled another round of dilators. You are brought to the preop area and again given ibuprofen, Flagyl and this time Xanax to help with anxiety. The IV Is started by the nursing staff and you wait or sleep in my case until your turn. You are wheeled to the operating room and placed in stirrups. They encourage personal headphones to tune out the noise or if you want your support person to support you from afar. I chose spa music and zoned out while the anesthesia meds were given. I do not remember much because I was asleep. I woke up when I felt tugging and pulling and went back to sleep. I woke up again when I felt someone pushing on my abdomen and then went back to sleep. Next thing I know, Im in recovery. Its done and over. I had no pain at all. I was wheeled to the bathroom to have my bleeding checked via the tampon inserted during the procedure. Basically they check to see how saturated the tampon is to gauge if you are experiencing too much bleeding. During this process the nurse was pushing on my abdomen some more. There was no judgement and you can tell they were use to attending to women in this way daily. I was wheeled back to recovery and given a heating pad and slept until I woke up enough to leave. The nursing staff called my husband to let him know what time I would be ready. Before leaving two pills are given to you to help prevent milk from developing. 

Of course instructions are reiterated to monitor for excessive bleeding. My overall experience was positive in that the staff did not cast judgement or treat me with anything other than compassion for my situation and respect. I felt very supported in the decision that I made from the doctors to every person I encountered in the building. I felt empowered that I made the choice for my child not to suffer in this world on my terms. I am at peace with the decision that I made although it hurt like hell every day. 

I am making this post to shed light and clarity on my experience with the Hope clinic. When I was deciding which clinic to attend, I was looking for a post similar to this to calm my anxiety and answer some of my questions. This post is meant to be a guidance with no sugarcoating regarding the important choice that needs to be made regarding our bodies. Again, I was 22 weeks and three days when I had my TFMR. The cost is dictated by how far along you are. I paid $2500, in addition to hotel and travel. There are charities that will provide hotel, travel, and assistance with the procedure cost. 

I felt no pain and suffering and thats ultimately what I wanted. My experience was a positive one with the Hope clinic in Illinois. DM me if you have specific questions and I will answer honestly.

After about an hour it got pretty bad, it was extremely painful, i considered taking the narcotic that the clinic gave me but it only lasted about 30 minutes.

"986",986,"MA Journey in <<","2025-03-31",1743386336,"MA Journey in <õ<í","**Hi! Id like to share my journey throughout the medical abortion process. I was ***6 weeks and 3 days*** pregnant when I began the MA procedure (WoW Pills).**

**Positive Pregnancy Test**

***March 15***
I decided to take a pregnancy test because I had been feeling unusually moody and constantly hungry. However, I didn't have any of the typical pregnancy symptoms like nausea or morning sickness. At the time, I was already a week late for my period. My boyfriend and I had just had an argument, and I noticed that I was feeling way more emotional than usualoverreacting to the smallest things. It seemed like a strange reason to take a test, but to my surprise, it came out positive. >r

I took one test in the morning and immediately informed my partner. He bought three more tests, and I took them all. They all came back with the same result.


**Ordering of Pills**

***March 17***
To be sure, I took three more tests, and the results were the same. Without waiting for an OB check-up, we decided to order the pills the same day.

***March 18***
The pills were approved, and the email confirmation said they would be shipped in 12 business days. However, because they came from another country, they had to pass through various warehouses and customs.


**OB Check-Up &amp; Transvaginal Ultrasound**

***March 26***
I felt anxious about taking the abortion pills without confirmation from a doctor, so I went to my nearest clinic. I had been overthinking whether I was really pregnant or if I might have PCOS (which can sometimes cause a false positive). Thankfully, I didnt have PCOS or any other rare cysts. Unfortunately, the ultrasound confirmed that I was pregnant. The doctor estimated I was 6 weeks and 1 day along, based on the first day of my last menstruation, which occurs on the 9th of each month.


**Receiving the Pills**

On ***March 26***, we tracked the pills and saw that they had arrived at customs.  
On ***March 27***, around 7:30 AM, the tracking showed they were available for delivery. We expected them to arrive the next day, but to our surprise, the package was delivered to my boyfriend's apartment at 10:40 AM.

**Mife Day:** ***March 27***
We didnt want to delay the process, so I decided to take the pills the same day they arrived.

**[3:00 PM]** Took 1 ibuprofen  
**[4:07 PM]** Took the mife  
I didnt feel anything immediately, and I was glad I had worn an overnight pad since I started bleeding like I would during a period.

***Note: My suggestion would be  making sure your bodys in the right condition before doing MA, such as eating 3 meals a day (breakfast, lunch, dinner) and getting atleast 6-8 hours of sleep. Youll be losing lots of blood during the process, you must be mentally well too.***

***After taking the mife, you should wait for 24 hours before taking the miso***

**Miso Day:** ***March 28***


**1ST DOSE**

**[2:30 PM]** Had lunch

**[3:00 PM]** Took 2 ibuprofen and 1 bonamine  
**[4:07 PM]** Took 4 miso tablets, placing them under my tongue. 

After about 20 minutes, the pills were almost completely dissolved. The pain started within 10 minutes of the miso dissolving and worsened around 20 minutes in. 

Pain was 8/10. I have high-pain tolerance, the pain during the process was the same as the worst period cramps Ive experienced (once) my whole life. 

**[4:37 PM]** Most of the pills were dissolved, so I swallowed the remaining small amount and drank water.  

I went to the bathroom and began bleeding, passing small blood clots the size of a pea.  

**[5:21 PM]** I returned to the bathroom, and the bleeding increased, with a few blood clots.  
**[6:04 PM]** I returned to the bathroom and felt more blood on my pad. There were additional blood clots.  
**[6:20 PM]** The bleeding continued, and I passed larger blood clots, roughly the size of golf balls.  

**2ND DOSE**

**[7:07 PM]** Took the second dose of miso tablets.  
The tablets dissolved within 5 minutes.  
**[7:26 PM]** I swallowed the dissolved pills, as they had become liquid.  

I accidentally swallowed earlier than it should be. It dissolved immediately under 5 minutes &amp; I couldnt help it anymore since my mouth was also already filled with saliva. 
***Note: You should dissolve the miso sublingually or cheek for 30 minutes then swallow the remains.***


**[9:00 PM]** Took 1 ibuprofen  

I experienced 2nd wave of cramps but it wasnt as extreme as the first one.

I had few bites of salad wrap since Im feeling so hungry due to exhaustion.
 ***Note: You cant eat nor drink while the miso still in your mouth, only eat before taking another dose or after the dose.***

**3RD DOSE**

**[10:07 PM]** Took the third dose of miso.  

By **10:37 PM**, after swallowing the third dose, I went to the bathroom again. The bleeding was lighter than earlier, but there were still some small blood clots.  
I also experienced some chest pains, though I wasnt sure if it was a side effect of the pill or due to acidity.

After this I had my dinner.


***March 29***

I woke up around 8 AM, and my partner was still asleep. I didnt want to wake him since he hadnt gotten much sleep the previous day and night. (A huge thank you to him for being by my side throughout this process.)

I still had cramps, but they were much milder, like the usual cramps I get during my period. Around **8:30 AM**, I had a light salad wrap for breakfast to avoid upsetting my stomach.  


**4TH DOSE**

After breakfast,  
**[9:00 AM]** Took 1 ibuprofen  
**[10:30 AM]** Took another dose of miso.  


***Note: Take 4 tablets of miso for the first dose, then the rest of the doses should only be 2 tablets  as per WoW.***

I ended up taking 4 doses in total, though it was unnecessary. According to WoW, you can take up to 5 doses if you're concerned about the success of the procedure. I took extra precautions to ensure there wouldn't be any remains.  

After swallowing the remaining miso, I went to the bathroom and had a soft stool. That was the extent of it for the day.  

The next day, I was feeling much better, with only occasional cramps. I even managed to clean my entire condo and take a cold shower which was a huge relief. 

Im still bleeding &amp; I think youre really supposed to bleed for weeks  3 weeks maximum? Im planning to get an ultrasound after a week to lessen my worries if the process was successful.

---


In another life, I am 100% sure I would have kept the baby. But in this life, I just couldn't  for now. Im still in my 20s, focused on surviving my studies. My partner and I arent fully ready, and while we know we would have given our child all the love and care, we didnt want to force something beyond our current capacity. This decision weighed heavily on me, but it also brought me a sense of relief.

To any woman out there who is considering or struggling with an unwanted pregnancy or post-abortion emotions, please know that you are not alone. Its okay to feel conflicted, and its okay to prioritize yourself and your well-being. We dont have to keep an unwanted pregnancy just because we feel bad about it, even though society or others may make us feel guilty. You deserve to live your life fully, without being burdened by a decision that doesnt align with your current reality. Remember, your healthboth mental and physicalshould always come first. We are strong, capable, and deserving of the freedom to choose what is best for us. It may be scary, but do it with the confidence that you are making the best decision for yourself.","abortion",4,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jnsjs5/ma_journey_in/"
"987",987,"My abortion experience (pt. 1)","2025-03-26",1742986442,"My abortion experience (pt. 1)","I'm a 24 year old Filipina who underwent both an at-home MA via pills from WoW and eventually flew to Thailand to get an abortion at Klongtun Hospital. Reading the posts here really helped me prepare for what was to come but since my reality turned out to be somewhat different, I wanted to post this on here to offer a slightly different viewpoint through my personal experience in hopes of maybe giving comfort to fellow Filipinas whose journey might not be as smooth. 

This post is going to be about my (failed) MA experience and I'll post a separate thread for my trip to Klongtun since that experience alone is a very lengthy story to tell on its own.

I first found out I was pregnant on Dec. 18, 2024. My last period was Nov. 5 so I assumed I was just 6 weeks in. I couldn't go to an OB GYN to have this checked because my partner and I had just moved in and all our salaries + savings went to the new house.

Back to the timeline, I took two pregnancy tests at different hours and they both turned out to be positive. Right away, I went to look for termination options. Since abortion is still illegal in PH, the options were extremely limited. I eventually came across some posts on here about Women on Web. I reached out to them, donated the needed amount, and got the package 3 weeks later (Jan. 10, 2025). 

I was pretty scared to do an at-home medical abortion as I didn't fully know what to expect at first, and I only had the stories of other Pinays here as my guide/reference point. I followed the usual instructions, experienced terrible diarrhea and passed multiple blood clots so I thought that was that. I assumed I was 8 weeks in by then. The pregnancy symptoms I experienced in the weeks leading up to the MA were no longer manifesting but I took 2 pregnancy tests 4 weeks later (Feb. 16) and they both came out positive. 

The thing is, my body is naturally resistant to a lot of different medicines so I'm assuming that the normal dose of misoprostol wouldn't have been enough in the first place. This was confirmed when I had my clinical abortion in Thailand and I had to take multiple different kinds of medication just to get my body to cooperate (more on this later).

I was so distressed that I decided to just let loose. I started eating raw seafood again and drinking as much as I could, hoping that it might do anything to impair what was growing inside me. A month later, we decided to have an ultrasound to see what was happening inside me. By this time, we thought I'd be 12 weeks in since I still had my period in November but the doctor told us I was at 15 weeks, the start of my 2nd trimester. She also told us that the baby was healthy and ""malikot"" (Tagalog for energetic or restless, if I'm not mistaken). 

Upon hearing this, my partner and I were even more heartbroken than we originally were. For a split second, we both thought about keeping the baby. We were both amazed by how strong the baby was and for a bit there, we were hopeful. Like somehow, this was a sign that we should keep the baby despite the circumstances. But when we were told how much my maintenance medicine and the delivery costs would be, we realised that it wasn't possible. Sure, we were double income, but even with both of us working, our salaries have barely been enough to keep the two of us going. How much more with a baby? 

I cried for days on end because the guilt felt all-consuming. At the time, my thought process was that it would be easier to part ways with the baby if we knew that it would be born with any birth defects. This wasn't the case. I didn't want to go through another at-home abortion because I no longer trusted myself to do this (given that the first one was a fail) so we gathered up as much money as we could from our savings and were even reached out to friends for help. We needed this baby terminated. Three weeks later, once we had the means, we booked an appointment at Klongtun and set off for Bangkok.

Detailed BKK experience will be posted after a bit. Admittedly, it took a lot for me to write this. If anyone has any concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. God knows no one should be going through this alone.","abortion",1,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jk8zcq/my_abortion_experience_pt_1/"

For my first abortion, I was about 5 weeks and chose a medical abortion. I took mifepristone first, then about six hours later, I took misoprostol orally. My cramps were mild, and the experience felt similar to a period. Once I passed the pregnancy, I felt fine and was even out walking around the mall the next day.  

For my most recent abortion at 6 weeks, I decided to take the misoprostol vaginally. The cramps were excruciatingeach time they hit, I would break into a sweat and get a hot flash. Ibuprofen didnt help, and I felt completely helpless. The pain was so intense that I threw up, and I couldnt sleep at all because nothing provided relief. I even considered going to the emergency room, but the on-call nurse reassured me that my level of pain was still within the normal range. A very hot shower finally helped, and after about 12 hours, I passed the pregnancy and was finally able to sleep.  

If I ever find myself in this situation again, Id probably opt for a surgical abortionI'd rather deal with a few minutes of discomfort than 12 hours of severe pain.  

Im sharing this because you can read all the experiences in the world (and I did), but you never truly know how it will go for you.

In case she does can anyone please give us advice on how to safely go through with an abortion? I should add that there is a clinic we can go to but she requires an ID card and a health card, two things she doesnt have on her. Which leads to another question of how do we get her both? Please any help would be appreciated and i desperately dont want anything horrible to happen to our relationship due to this.

I found out I was pregnant December 28 and had my MA abortion on January 5th and I just wanted to let all of you know that it DOES get better. For the first month I felt so lost and I missed what could have been and I regretted it every single day of my life but giving the situation to God really helped with moving forward. Regardless of what your guys beliefs are, I just wanna let you all know that it DOES get better and I promise the pain doesnt last forever.
