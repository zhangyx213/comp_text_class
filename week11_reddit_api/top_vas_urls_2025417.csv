"Absolutely devastated but I know what I have to do","2025-04-09",1744218556,"Absolutely devastated but I know what I have to do","My husband has been rescheduled for a vasectomy 3 times in the past 5 months and we have been using condoms in the meantime. I took a test yesterday and I was absolutely shocked when it came back positive. We already have 2 small children. We both agreed that with the way the economy is going, his job isnt promised because its a yearly contract, Im a SAHM, we just bought our house last year and dont have room in our house, were not financially or emotionally capable of having another baby, not to mention its already a struggle most days with my 3&amp;1 year old. I had PPD with my youngest and I cant go through that again. I feel absolutely horrible and guilty because i would love another baby, but i cant even imagine how much harder our lives would be and i dont want to make life harder for my boys. My heart is breaking. ","abortion",19,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jvb13i/absolutely_devastated_but_i_know_what_i_have_to_do/"
"Loneliness in my decision, please someone talk to me","2025-04-12",1744471648,"Loneliness in my decision, please someone talk to me","I don't want to do this. I'm a married mom of 2 and my husband doesn't want anymore children. He also wants to move from California to Texas next month. I found out I was pregnant last week and I'm 6 weeks along, he's always known that I'm pro-choice for others but prolife for myself.he was supposed to get a vasectomy last year and never got around to it but now that I'm pregnant he keeps urging me to get an abortion and basically saying if I keep it he's not going to let the new baby slow down his life. He keeps making jokes about abortions and saying this new kid needs an ""eviction notice"". I depend on him financially and I'm afraid he'll leave if I don't get an abortion so I've scheduled my appointment. My heart is aching, I'm also scared that if I did decide to keep it and we move to Texas, I may not get adequate care if something went wrong. I'm all over the place, I know. I'm just feeling so alone and don't know what to do","abortion",6,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jxjto2/loneliness_in_my_decision_please_someone_talk_to/"
"MA at 6 weeks - not to bad!","2025-04-08",1744114097,"MA at 6 weeks - not to bad!","Hey everyone! I promised myself that I would come and share my experience when I did my MA so here we go.

I found out I was pregnant around 5w4d, this was clearly a surprise as I just stopped bc and didnt even get my period. My husband is planning on getting a Vasectomy soon and  I was tired of being on the pill. I figured we could wait for my cycle to start and then do the rhythm method. We are 1 and done and both knew we were not interested in having more children. My first labor was also incredibly traumatic and I didnt want to go through that again. I still had lots of mixed feelings about it that we did talk and sort through and ultimately decided this was the best decision for me and our family. I got the pills online since my anxiety couldnt deal with handling protestors. They came in 5 days from order to at my front door. 

I took the mifepristone on Sunday around 8:30 am and didnt have any side effects.
Monday I ate some toast and a banana and took ibuprofen 800 at 9:00 am and then took the misoprostol pills at 9:30 am and let them dissolve under my tongue for the 30 mins then swallowed the rest. This wasnt awful but wasnt pleasant either. 

Almost immediately at 10 am I started feeling a dull achy cramps a 1/10 on the pain scale def there but not noticeable.  After about an hour I got up and sat on the toilet and immediately heard a large plop in the toilet that looked like a large clot and started bleeding. Surprisingly I took comfort in knowing this was working. I went and laid in the bed and my husband rubbed my back while I used the heating pad. I started to have slightly more intense cramps 4/10 and decided to get in the tub and that helped a bit I would get on the toilet every so often and see bleeding and clots coming out.  

The bath helped and Then I transitioned to the shower. This was around 2 pm the cramps never were unbearable or even painful at this point. After that I laid in the bed and did eventually nap for about 2 hours. I woke up and changed my pad and there was moderate bleeding. 

I ate some snacks, took a THC gummy and had dinner. All and all it seemed to have worked and I didnt have any crazy pain, I was prepared for the worst but my experience overall was mildly unpleasant.

What helped: 
A heating bad or taking a bath
Taking a ibuprofen before the medication 
Having water and snacks close by
Tv, books, etc for distraction 
I also had a garbage can in case I needed to vomit and extra towels down on my bed in case of lots of blood. ","abortion",2,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jubylz/ma_at_6_weeks_not_to_bad/"
"Relief &amp; Grief  I need to vent","2025-03-20",1742443172,"Relief &amp; Grief  I need to vent","I (27 AFAB NB) am so blessed to have my fiancee (26 M). So, insanely, blessed.

We found out yesterday. I had my suspicions, but my period has always been irregular and unpredictable. I mostly took the test to calm my nerves, to reassure myself it was just my period getting closer. That second line just kept getting darker, and darker, and a lot less ambiguous. 

We're lucky to live in a medical hub city with a respectable and kind women's health clinic. My ultrasound got scheduled for next week to see what the gestation is at, and the assessment. 

Our parents respect our decision; we are no where near ready to start a family; we need financial stability, we both need to work on our mental health before we can feel right about bringing a child into our lives, and the state of the world right now doesn't exactly inspire confidence in our child's future. We also agreed on a plan a long time ago; if we ever decide to have children, we will do the adoption route. There are too many kids in the system that need families, and he himself went through the system for a short while when he was younger. This is important for both of us.

He stayed up all night to do research on abortion, on the processes and the millions of ways it can go right and wrong. He has always been my rock; sometimes I think he supports me as much as he does as a way to soothe himself, even if he doesn't realize it. He's so, so sweet. 

Now he's at work, I'm alone. It's the first time I've been able to think on my own and process it all at my pace. Except, I didn't realize just how much weight was on my shoulders. I feel heavy, I feel depressed. I know we're doing what's best, I know this is the only way things can be okay. It's not fair to the thing we made, it's not fair to us. I just can't help but feel bad for it, even though it has no idea what it is. I grieve for this thing that, maybe in a better world, it could've had a chance. 

Does this make sense? To grieve for something that was never going to happen? To grieve for something that makes me feel more at peace knowing it's better off this way? To grieve for a concept? 

He's keeping tabs on me even while he works hard. He's taken steps to get referred for a vasectomy; I plan on advocating for my tubes to be tied as soon as this is over, even though I know it will be a struggle. His mom is trying not to show that she's upset about him being gung-ho about being snipped. I think she resents me for his decision; she assumed I asked him to do this but this is his idea. She assumed I just didn't want to go through the litigation I've wanted one since I found out it was possible. 

I feel empathy for her, since she's had a couple failed marriages and countless misfortunes in romance, so she's skeptical about our relationship lasting. She tried making him think of a future where we're not together, whether I died or left him. He shut that down so fast, stating he doesn't think he would get over it if I died. I believe him because I feel the same for him. 

I'm sorry, I don't even know why I'm rambling about this; I think I just need to feel like I'm talking to someone who might understand. 

TL;DR: Terminating our pregnancy is the only option for us, and I'm relieved, but I grieve for our baby that will never be.

"SA and venting/reassurance","2025-03-26",1743014313,"SA and venting/reassurance","Okay so I'm sorry if this is long but my brain is a jumbled mess and I need to write out everything to help. 

So last week I officially found out I was pregnant (from my last period I'm 5 weeks 2 days but from what I'm 99% sure is the day on conception I'm 3weeks 4 days) , my husband and I assumed, but we're waiting till the last second praying I wasn't pregnant. 

We were just being very not careful and I'm usually good with checking to see if I'm ovulating cause we don't want a 3rd kid but it was a morning surprise and I didn't check ..and here we are...
 (If anyone asks he was going to get a vasectomy but didn't have any days off left this year so we usually use condoms but clearly didn't)

I have a 5 yr old and a 5mo old I love them more than absolutely anything and I could not picture my life without them, but I absolutely do not want another child. 

Besides the fact I know I could not do 2 under 2, I'm absolutely not mentally okay to handle that and for parents out there that do that or have done that I give you the biggest of praises and so much respect. My last pregnancy was absolutely atrocious, constantly vomiting and I also had gestational diabetes (which now the Drs are all over and basically stereotyping me, I did not have diabetes with my first but they all assumed I did cause of my weight) 

Anyway, I knew immediately when I saw the positive I was going to get this pregnancy terminated I got through these brief periods of me forgetting I'm even pregnant, or relief that I'm getting this pregnancy terminated or immense guilt and nausea (I get nauseous due to severe anxiety) 

I went to the obgyn on Monday and went through options I said I would prefer a surgical abortion as I'm a SAHM and I would like a quicker recovery to take care of my 5 mo old. Tomorrow I go in for an ultrasound and I'm so scared I don't want to see anything or hear anything I want to be ignorant and pretend I'm not pregnant at all but then I'm afraid the person will judge me for getting a termination. I'm also afraid if I see the ultrasound I'll want to keep the pregnancy and I can't... mentally and especially financially I can't, we can't...

So I was just curious if anyone had any stories on surgical abortion? I see a lot about the pill but not many about the surgical and I need to know it will be okay, I think I'm still trying to wrap my head around this and I'm not sure I'm coping very well... I keep pushing my emotions down and trying to just... Forget and I know that's not healthy but I don't know what to do. I'm just so upset with myself and having to be in this situation. 

Thanks for anyone who read all this. 

TLDR; 
In need of surgical abortion stories and what it entails to prepare myself. ","abortion",3,"https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jkj439/sa_and_ventingreassurance/"
