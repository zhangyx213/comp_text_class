After *not so thorough* research into the SFF scene, we created the following rules for the competition:\n\nAll participants' computers must adhere to the following restrictions:\n\n* The computer must be built using a single Lenovo M720q or M920q case and based on its motherboard.\n* The computers case must have external dimensions equivalent to the original. Only the PSU may be outside the case. The exterior of the computer can be modified, but the appearance must be \""living room friendly.\""\n* CPU: at the competitors' discretion.\n* GPU: The GPU must be powered through the PCIe slot. Ada Lovelace microarchitecture chips are not allowed. The image must be produced using rasterization; frame generation is not allowed in the competition.\n* PSU: maximum of 300W; power brick model.\n* Other components of the computer including CPU/memory clock frequencies, operating system, and budget, are at the discretion of the competitors.\n* Each competitor may participate with only one computer.\n* The entire computer must be physically present at the competition.\n* Manipulating or modifying tests is not allowed (excluding the optimization of software settings or the operating system).\n\nAn independent panel of 2-3 judges will be appointed for the competition. A competitor cannot serve as a judge. The panel will convene if necessary to make final decisions in situations where rules are suspected to have been violated. Additionally, the panel will oversee the calculation of scores.\n\nScoring: Each benchmark \023 CineBench r23 Multicore, Arma 3 YAAB &amp; 3dMark TimeSpy \023 will be run once per competitor. Benchmark specific scores will be multiplied together (CineBench x YAAB x TimeSpy). If the benchmark run is interrupted due to a malfunction of the computer, the competitor will receive a score of 1 for that benchmark. In unclear situations, the panel will make a decision prioritizing the competitor's benefit. The panel will also evaluate each computer's living room suitability: those that do not pass the panel's critical assessment will receive a penalty multiplier of x0.99 on the final score. Clear violations of the rules will result in the disqualification of the competitor's computer.\n\nThe winner of the competition will be the competitor with the highest total score.\n\nThe key objective for the rules was to balance *size* (1 litre), *performance* (a viable gaming computer) and *budget*. The previous competition accidentally skyrocketed the budgets used on the computers, so this time around it was necessary to take proper action to protect the competitors from themselves; for example, Ada lovelace GPU\031s  were banned from the competition. Similarly, by forcing the competitors\031 computers to the same Lenovo platform, expensive custom motherboards were ruled out. \n\nAfter unveiling the rules, four competitors participated in the contest. The platforms were scraped up from ebay and other 2nd hand online stores. The initial expense of the four computers was between 70 euros and 250 euros depending on the innards of the machines and the competitors\031 eye (and patience) for good deals.\n\nAfter a preparation time of approximately four months, the four competitors entered the competition with computers that had the following specifications:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nen0gfa61kue1.png?width=797&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02dd5675500d86af31fe6670435cd0ebca394f59\n\n^(1)Scores in competition / best score gained outside the competition  \n^(2)Did not finish; test crashed  \n^(3)The competitor received a penalty multiplier of x0.99 because the computer did not meet the panels\031 standards for living room friendliness.\n\n[Picture 1.

We cannot guarantee that what has worked for us will work for everyone. Should something go wrong, we *will not be there to save the day*. Proceed with caution and be prepared for rigorous troubleshooting *when* something goes wrong.\n\n* Out of the box, voltage control and overclocking are locked in M920q\031s. However, one can unlock these controls by either flashing in a custom bios, or by editing the UEFI variables with RU.efi software. We opted for the latter option. The process of unlocking is quite similar to the one described in this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/hz2rtm/cfg_lockunlocking_alternative_method/). To oversimplify greatly, the process entails following steps:\n   * Flash in the newest bios\n   * Use Uefitool (or similar) to open said bios, search for a variable (e.g., cfg lock) and save a Setup folder as .bin file \n   * Use IFR extractor to make the bin. file readable \n   * Look for the variable in the document produced by IFR extractor\n   * Make note of the offsets you'll want to change \n   * Boot to RU.efi using usb-drive\n   * Adjust the variables in hexadecimals\n* To unlock voltage and CPU frequency control, you\031ll want to edit the following variables: CFG Lock, OverClocking feature and Overclocking lock. In RU.efi these are located in UEFI variables \u0092 Setup. Please note that these options do not show up in UEFI even after editing the values; you will need to remember what was edited (the changes done to the UEFI variables can be reset using clear cmos jumper).\n* Intel Virtualization needs to disabled in UEFI to enable voltage options (FIVR) in ThrottleStop. This setting is natively visible in UEFI; no need to use RU.efi for this.\n* CPU\031s beyond the officially supported list do in fact work well with M920q, supposing you are willing to unlock the bios and undervolt your CPU with something like ThrottleStop. Given the fact that among many tested CPU\031s we tried several K-series processors (9600K, 9700K, 9900K, 9900K ES), this makes a strong case for arguing that every (non-xeon) Coffee Lake processor will ultimately work with this platform.\n* The temperatures are way off the charts without undervolting the CPU. For example, the temperature of CC150 with a healthy -145mV undervolt (core and cache) dropped about 15\031c while gaining about \\~200 points in Cinebench R23 Multicore.\n* Officially the M920q only supports 35W TDP CPUs. However, if you switch the CPU cooler and the heatsink to a 65W variant (01MN631 &amp; 01MN632; these are FRU numbers, Field Replaceable Unit numbers Lenovo uses) \023 like the ones you get with M920x, you will get much more overhead for your CPU temperatures.\n* Please note that the factory installed VRM thermal pads in 01MN631 are absolute garbage: there were plastic peels between (sic) the pad and the heatsink in every heatsink we saw during the competition. Changing the pads is strongly recommended (any quality 1.0-1.5mm thermal pad should do the trick).\n* There is anecdotal evidence circulating the internet stating that with the dedicated GPU installed, the system limits the CPU power draw to 35W (with M920x motherboard the cap apparently is at 65w). This indeed is the case when the system is at full load, that is, when both the CPU and the GPU are fully loaded: GPU gets the full 70W of power while CPU is capped at 35W. However, outside synthetic tests (e.g., while gaming), both are usually fully not loaded, so the 35W cap may not be an issue with each and every CPU. When just the CPU is loaded the only power limit is PL1/PL2. We tried editing these values both in ThrottleStop and in BIOS but these seem to change nothing.\n* The aforementioned 35W CPU cap can be bypassed by editing IMON slope variables (core, gt, vccin and sa). The value indicates the percentage of power usage the CPU reports back to the motherboard. If you set these to 50, for example, the CPU power limit of 35W is doubled to 70W since the motherboard power delivery is tricked into believing the CPU is only consuming 35W. **Tread with extreme caution:** adjusting IMON values may result in bricked hardware since the platform feeds way more power to the components than it\031s designed to do. Our systems that used adjusted IMON values were mainly stable, but one computer\031s motherboard was fried after editing the values.\n* Speaking of power: we tested 135W, 170W, 230W and 300W power bricks, of which the first two worked flawlessly for everyone (officially power bricks are only supported up to 135W). Interestingly, both the 230W and 300W power bricks had issues in one of the computers as they throttled the CPU power down to 35W (other M920q\031s in the competition worked well with both psus).  We suppose this has something to do with Smart Sense features that allow the psu to communicate its capabilities to the chipset. Nevertheless, the 135W power brick also had its share of issues: with 9900K and RTX A2000 installed, the nominal wattage of the psu was continuously exceeded which resulted in a fried psu. All in all, 170W psu seems to be the most safe solution.\n* On the SFF forums you will see many examples of people drilling holes to the top cover of the M920q to allow the CPU cooler to suck in fresh air. However, the M920q CPU cooler is a blower style cooler that sucks air from *below* the cooler. This means that the cooler effectively sucks its air through the front panel, not from the top. Drilling hole(s) for CPU cooler might have *some* diminishing impact for CPU temps but the effect is likely to be little to none.\n* On the GPU side of things, however, adding air flow is of paramount importance. Drilling holes, using custom 3d printed cover or a perforated cover from something like M920x (02CW661), or running without the top cover altogether are viable alternatives. For example, one of our setups used the top cover from Lenovo P3 fitted with the original M920q front cover (as shown in picture 1). This required some dremeling, drilling and a few M2.5 screws/nuts to attach the original front cover, but overall this was quite doable.\n* If you plan on adding a dedicated GPU, you will want to install a south bridge heat sink (5H40U52594) to cool the motherboard chipset. It gets very warm with practically no airflow inside the case. The heatsink does not interfere with GPU installation but sits nice and flat below the GPU. \n* M920q has a pcie slot but it is a proprietary design, meaning you will need a riser to add a GPU. For M920q the correct riser seems to be 01AJ940. Beware that many ebay listings sell totally different risers using this FRU. The correct riser should have \034BA7H70 REV: 1.2\035 etched to its pcb. Something else may also work, but for example risers with \034tiny 4\035 etching, are not meant for GPU\031s and will only work on gen 1 / gen 2 bandwidths. Apparently, using incompatible risers may also fry your motherboard. \n* GPU-wise you are restricted to *low profile*, *single slot* and *pcie* (slot) *powered GPU:s*, assuming you\031ll want to maintain the 1-litre form factor (you can of course 3D print a custom top cover that would accommodate a double slot GPU). The best bang for the buck at the moment of writing this (April 2025) seems to be either RTX A2000 or a 6gb / low profile variant of the RTX 3050 ([for example from Yeston](https://yestonstore.com/products/yeston-rtx-3050-6gb-gddr6-gaming-graphics-card)). Either of these cards will give you a nice &gt;60fps (1080p high / 1440p medium) performance in most games. A2000 needs a [custom single slot cooler from N3rdware](https://n3rdware.com/components/single-slot-rtx-a2000-cooler). A2000 runs a little hotter using a single slot cooler, but overall the temperature remains well under the max 88\031c even at sustained full load.\n* The motherboard seems to trip with GPU clocks above 1500/1600Mhz (at least with A2000): if you experience system crashes or instability, try using MSI Afterburner to limit the max boost clock to 1500/1600Mhz. You will definitely want to undervolt your GPU as well both for increased stability and performance. Compared to the unstable stock GPU scoring a bit over 6000 pts in Timespy graphics test, a GPU restricted to 1575Mhz and 700mV scored over 1000 points more. \n* The anecdotal evidence in the internet points to the fact that the system hardware cannot handle power spikes of the dedicated GPU. To overcome the issue of the system tripping at high GPU frequency, we tried adjusting \034PEG0-3 Slot Power Limit Value\035 in UEFI variables. Maxing the value (FF) only worsened the situation. Dialing the value down to 70W (the default setting is 75W) seems to increase stability slightly, but there are still cases where the platform would hard shutdown. \n* You should be able use any 1.2V sodimm DDR4 ram. \n* We could not find a way to adjust memory timings using software like XTU or something similar. However, you can adjust memory timings (like tcl, trcd, trp and tras) through UEFI parameters via RU.efi. The timings are set directly in hexadecimals. For custom timings to work you will also need to enable both \034Realtime memory timings\035 and \034Custom memory profile\035. **In our experience the system becomes unstable even with subtle changes to timings.** \n* If your system fails to POST after adjustments in RU.efi \023 which is more than probable at some point when adjusting RAM \023 you can clear CMOS to undo the adjustments and return the factory defaults. The procedures described at the internet vary quite a bit, but based on our experience the following works:\n   * Turn off the computer and unplug the power cord.\n   * Locate the jumper in the motherboard that is labeled JP35. The jumper should by default be in pins 5-6.\n   * Jump pins 2 and 4 using the jumper. \n   * Plug the power cord and turn on the system. After the pc speaker beeps, push the power button to turn off the computer. \n   * Reboot once more, wait for beeps, and then unplug the power cord and return the jumper to pins 5-6. \n   * Plug in the power cord, and turn the computer on. (You may need to reboot the computer once using the power button). CMOS is \023 or should be \023 cleared.\n* You can purchase many parts directly from [Lenovo](https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/parts-lookup). In many cases, the prices are even cheaper than those of ebay, Amazon or Aliexpress.\n\nShoutout to [ETA Prime](https://www.youtube.com/@ETAPRIME) and [ITG Gear](https://www.youtube.com/@itggear) Youtube channels for tips and inspiration as well as to Parallax for providing a thorough [reference thread](https://forums.servethehome.com/index.php?threads/lenovo-thinkcentre-thinkstation-tiny-project-tinyminimicro-reference-thread.34925/) for Lenovo Thinkcentres.\n\nMost importantly, thank you [Reintseri](https://www.reddit.com/u/Otherwise-Internal99/s/8Ofot6kK39), Aeses and Competitor 3 for the thrill of competition &lt;3"""
