\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 One evening in December, 2021, Deanna Doss Shrodes had come home from work. The TV was tuned to a news segment about the oral arguments at the Supreme Court for the case that challenged Roe v. Wade. Deanna is a pastor and a director of women's ministries at a Pentecostal church in Florida. She is opposed to abortion, and was glad that Roe might soon be overturned. But then Amy Coney Barrett asked about "safe haven" laws, which permit a mother who doesn't want to keep her baby to drop it off anonymously in a deposit box at a hospital or a fire station. Why, Barrett wanted to know, didn't safe-haven laws remove the burden that was allegedly being imposed upon a woman who couldn't obtain an abortion? The woman wouldn't be forced to be a parent, and the baby could be adopted. At this point, Deanna became so upset that she stopped listening.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Deanna is adopted, and she has spent much of her life grappling with the emotional consequences of that. She believes that a child who starts life in a box will never know who they are, unless they manage somehow to track down their anonymous parents. It distresses her that many of her fellow-Christians, such as Barrett, talk about adoption as the win-win solution to abortion, as though once a baby is adopted that is the end of the story. If someone says of Deanna that she was adopted, she corrects them and says that she is adopted. Being adopted is, to her, as to many adoptees, a profoundly different way of being human, one that affects almost everything about her life.}

"And they'll say, Well, yes, but if it happens to a newborn what do they know? You were adopted, get over it. Would you tell your friend who lost their family in a car accident, Get over it? No. But as an adoptee you're expected to be over it because, O.K., that happened to you, but this wonderful thing also happened, and why can't you focus on the wonderful thing?"}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 "A big thing that adoptees get frustrated by is when people say that adopting kids is no different," Deanna said. "You know, if they say, I don't feel any differently about my biological kids than my adopted kids, I'm just a mom, we're just a family. That is not true." How many parents tell their adopted children, I love you as if you were my own? And how many of those  children wonder, Am I not your own?}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 One day, when she was very little, Deanna was playing hide-and-seek with her sister. She wriggled underneath her parents' bed to hide, and in the darkness she felt something hard and cold, made of metal. She pulled it out from under the bed and saw that it was a box. She opened it, and found a piece of paper with her name on it. The language on the paper was confusing, but she understood that it said that Melanie Lynn Alley, born in 1966, had become Deanna Lynn Doss.}

Deanna already knew that she was adopted, but she hadn't known that she'd had another name. Was Melanie Lynn Alley the person she would have become if her birth mother had kept her? It felt as though Melanie was a part of her, but a part that she couldn't see, that existed next to her, or behind her, like the ghost of a twin.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 "Some people have no issues at all with being an adoptee," Deanna said. "They're happy as a lark. They don't feel the pain, for whatever reason. But there are others who haven't come out of the fog, or they don't think they're in a fog, or whatever. And they join one of the adoptee groups and they go, What's wrong with all you people? I'm so happy, I'm so grateful, I don't see what you're upset about. That will create an explosion of people going, Why are you even here? This is a support group, not a place to come and talk about how happy you are."}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 "Coming out of the fog" means different things to different adoptees. It can mean realizing that the obscure, intermittent unhappiness or bewilderment you have felt since childhood is not a personality trait but something shared by others who are adopted. It can mean realizing that you were a good, hardworking child partly out of a need to prove that your parents were right to choose you, or a sense that it was your job to make your parents happy, or a fear that if you weren't good your parents would give you away, like the first ones did. It can mean coming to feel that not knowing anything about the people whose bodies made yours is strange and disturbing. It can mean seeing that you and your parents were brought together not only by choice or Providence but by a vast, powerful, opaque system with its own history and purposes.

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Some adoptees dislike the idea of the fog, because it suggests that an adoptee who doesn't feel the way that out-of-the-fog adoptees do must be deluded. And it's true; many out-of-the-fog adoptees do believe that. They point out that a person can feel fine about their adoption for most of their life and then some event-pregnancy, the death of a parent-will reveal to them that they were not fine at all. But there are many others who reject this-who aren't interested in searching for their birth parents, and think about their adoption only rarely in the course of their life.}

Deanna wept with fury during the movie, and when she discovered afterward that her husband didn't understand what she was crying about, despite having been married to her since she was twenty years old, she went online and discovered that there were dozens, maybe hundreds, of Web sites on which adoptees were talking to each other.}

Others were arguing about whether there was such a thing as a primal wound-whether a baby bonded in utero with its mother and felt abandoned if it were given up, even if it were handed over in the delivery room. Some had found their birth parents and were in the middle of whatever that was; some were still searching and needed advice about DNA or genealogy; many were waiting to search until their adoptive parents died, for fear of hurting them.

There is the older generation, the so-called Baby Scoop Era adoptees, such as Deanna-the mostly white children of the four million or so unmarried women who gave babies up for adoption between the end of the Second World War and the passing of Roe v. Wade. Many of those adoptions were forced, and almost all were closed-the identities of the birth parents and the adoptive names of their children were kept secret, making it very difficult for the parents and the children to find one another. There is the youngest generation, some of whom have open adoptions and have always known their birth parents, posting on adoptee TikTok. For some reason, it seems the vast majority of adoptees in the forums online are women.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 One thing almost everyone agrees on is that adult adoptees should have the unrestricted right to see their original birth certificates, rather than only the "amended" ones with the names of their adoptive parents (but this is the law in only a dozen states). Many adoptees condemn international adoption, which cuts children off from their native cultures more drastically than any other kind and makes it unlikely that they will ever find, much less know, their birth parents. (Rates of international adoption by Americans have plummeted in recent years, down ninety-three per cent since 2004.) Some adoptees want to end adoption altogether, although most believe that there are situations in which it is the best option. More want to end transracial adoption-to return adoption, in some ways, to its modern beginnings.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 A hundred years ago, adoption agencies tried to match children and parents so precisely that they could pass as a biological family. If parents wished to keep the adoption a secret, from the child or from the world, they could plausibly do it. Then, in the nineteen-fifties, some agencies set about persuading white parents to adopt children of color, with campaigns such as "Operation Brown Baby." The campaigns were successful-by the start of this decade, nearly three-quarters of adoptees of color were adopted into white families. Four generations of parents loved children of races different from their own. In much of the adoption world, whose foundational premise is that love is stronger than biology, color-blindness still seemed like a precious and viable ideal. But then the adopted children grew up and some of them-though by no means all-believed that love was not enough.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Many adoptees feel that the way we understand adoption has been dominated by the perspectives of adoptive parents. Birth parents are less often heard from, though almost anyone can understand the grief of a parent who gives up a child for adoption (one study found more than ninety per cent of those who are denied an abortion keep their child rather than give it up). But understanding how adoption can affect an adoptee is more difficult, because adoptees, and the various kinds of adoptions, are so different from one another.}

When Joy first met her parents, she spoke no English, but she went straight into first grade and learned the language in three months. Once she spoke English, her mother would tell her stories about how Joy had behaved when she first arrived from Korea-how, when her father came home from work, she ran to pull off his jacket and shoes and take his briefcase and sit him down and give him a massage and sing for him. How, when her mother was mopping the kitchen floor, Joy gestured for her to stop, that she would do it-she ran to fetch a rag and scrubbed the floor on her knees until it was so clean you could eat off it, then wrung out the cloth so thoroughly that when she was done the cloth was dry.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Deanna grew up next to Jones Creek, just outside Baltimore. Her father worked at a post office downtown, her mother worked at the V.A. in Fort Howard. They couldn't have kids, so they adopted two girls from different birth mothers, Deanna and her younger sister. The Dosses were conservative Pentecostal Christians, and their lives revolved around the church. Deanna often fell asleep under a pew during revival services that lasted into the night. When she was a child, sitting alone in her grandmother's back yard, she realized that she had a calling to the ministry.}

Whenever she was in a crowd of people, like at a baseball game in the city, she would scan the faces to see if there was anyone who looked familiar. Sometimes she stood outside looking at the moon and would wonder if her birth mother, wherever she was, was looking at the same moon. Every now and then, she asked her mother about her birth parents, but she felt that the subject made her uncomfortable, so she mostly kept her questions to herself.}

In 1989, Deanna gave birth to their first child, and she realized that this was the first time she had seen and touched a blood relative since her own birth. She understood more than she had before what it would be like to give up a baby. Suddenly, finding her birth mother felt urgent.}

The organization had been founded in 1971 by an adoptee named Florence Fisher; Fisher had been in a car crash, and her last thought before impact was I'm going to die and I don't know who I am. Deanna also contacted the agency that had brokered her adoption. She was told that she could petition the county court to open her records to a "confidential intermediary," who would contact her birth mother on her behalf. She agreed, and before long the intermediary called to say that she had spoken to Deanna's birth mother. The intermediary had told her that she would be proud of how Deanna had turned out-college educated, a pastor. The birth mother had said that she was sure she would be proud of Deanna, but she didn't think that Deanna would be proud of her. She didn't want to meet.}

She thought that maybe her being a pastor had put her birth mother off-people always thought pastors were going to judge them. If only the intermediary hadn't mentioned that. She asked if she could send her a letter, but the intermediary said no, that wasn't allowed. Her birth mother had thirty days to change her mind. For thirty days, Deanna pleaded with God every way she knew. She fasted and prayed. But the intermediary called and told her that the answer was still no.}

Culligan, a private investigator, on a talk show. He had written a book, "You, Too, Can Find Anybody," and guests on the show testified that, thanks to the book, they had used public information to find people for less than twenty dollars. Deanna sent Larry straight out to buy it. There were all kinds of techniques in the book, all kinds of records you could search for addresses if you had a last name-liens, leases, bankruptcies, writs of garnishment. You could write to the D.M.V. or check abandoned-property files. The best source, though, was the Death Master File, which contained the Social Security Administration's death records since 1962. The Salvation Army's missing-persons program told her that they knew of a source in California who could gain access to the Death Master File for only thirteen dollars. She knew that her birth mother had grown up near Richmond, Virginia. She called California and asked for records of any man in Richmond with her birth mother's maiden name who had died within a certain period of time.}

She wrote to libraries all over the city and ordered obituaries for every one of the names, looking for her mother's father. From her adoption paperwork she knew that her maternal grandfather had been an auto mechanic with six children, and that her birth mother was the youngest. The last obituary she received in the mail was of an auto mechanic who had had six children. That gave her her birth mother's current, married name.

At the time, they were both working as pastors at a church in Dayton, Ohio, and had two toddlers. Deanna called that evening to make sure that her birth mother wasn't out of town; when she answered the phone, Deanna hung up. She and Larry took the kids and drove through the night to Richmond.}

She had brought a camera-she would ask to take a photograph of her birth mother if it was to be the only time she saw her. The next day, in the hotel room, she changed clothes several times and settled on a pink suit. She waited until evening, walked up to her birth mother's house, and knocked on the door.}

She started crying, and began to tell Deanna about all the mistakes she had made in her life and how sorry she was for all of them. She told her that she had made a lot of bad choices, including her relationship with Deanna's father. She had failed in her relationship with her other children's father, and now she was divorced.

She was told that giving up the baby for adoption and pretending the whole thing had never happened was her only chance to redeem herself. If she gave the baby up, it would be raised in a decent home, and she would be able to pass herself off as a marriageable woman. It was the right thing to do.}

Then, in her second year, she became friends with a group of Black students and began to understand herself as a person of color. Later still, she made some Asian friends, and some Korean international students asked her to start an Asian student union. She felt like a fraud, as if she weren't really Asian, but the international students accepted her as such, and thought it was fun to fill in the gaps in her knowledge. They wanted to know whether she could use chopsticks, how high her spice tolerance was. She ate with them and found that her mouth still watered when she smelled kimchi. She tried to teach herself Koreanness. She put on a fashion show, for which she learned how to wear hanbok and do a fan dance.}

The director of the orphanage, who'd been there when Joy was a child and was now in her nineties, asked her, Are you here to meet your birth mother? Joy said, No, she's dead, and the director said, Oh, yes, right, right, right.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 After a few months at the orphanage, she felt something in her shift. She started to understand more Korean, and to speak it. She saw how hard the children worked-in school, and on the orphanage's farm-and how much disciplinary beating and humiliation the younger ones endured at the hands of the older ones. There was little warmth or affection in the orphanage, no joking or playing games. They worked, watched TV, ate, slept. There were only a few staff members for more than fifty children, from little kids to seventeen-year-olds, and some seemed to have no interest in the children.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 She also realized that none of the kids were actually orphans. They knew who their parents were, and most of them went home on national holidays. The orphanage was a combination of government boarding school and foster care-there was no American-style foster care in Korea. Usually there had been some kind of crisis in the family, like illness, or divorce, or poverty, that meant the parents couldn't take care of their child. Most of the children thought their stay in the orphanage would be temporary, but often it wasn't. Many became estranged from their birth families and couldn't find them when they aged out.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 The children were unlikely to be adopted-many fewer Korean children were being adopted abroad by then. The first wave of adoptions, after the Korean War-mostly the biracial children of Korean women and American soldiers-was long over. Adoptions had risen to a peak in the seventies and eighties. When Joy was a child, the Korean government had encouraged them, as a way of ridding itself of financially burdensome children, and as a kind of soft diplomacy with the West. But at the time of the 1988 Summer Olympics, in Seoul, the exporting of so many children became a source of embarrassment to Korea, and since then the numbers had declined.}

They had hated their time there, but now the orphanage kids were their family, and the orphanage their home. At first they assumed that Joy had been the lucky one-she could speak English, she had been to college, she lived in New York. But once her Korean was fluent enough she told them how lonely it had been growing up in a town with no Korean people. They couldn't fathom a place with no Korean people; they couldn't fathom that she would question whether she was Korean or not, or not know what that meant.}

Joy said that wasn't possible, her birth mother was dead. The woman said, No, it's true-an investigator had called on her behalf. Joy said, If she is my mother, she will have a photograph of me. The investigator had a photograph-it was a picture of a three-year-old girl, the age Joy was when she had last seen her mother. As soon as Joy saw the photograph, she knew it was her. She felt the blood leaving her face. She didn't know what to do. She suggested that she could sit in a park and the investigator could arrange for her birth mother to walk by her, so that she could see she was O.K. but they wouldn't have to speak. The investigator then told Joy that her mother was dying. Joy suspected that this was a ploy, but it forced her hand. She agreed to meet her mother the following week.}

She looked at the women and felt nothing. The woman across from her said, I don't think this is the right person. She asked Joy, Do you have a scar on your right leg? Joy said, Yes, I do-it's a burn mark from an iron. The woman started crying and said how sorry she was, that it was her fault, that she had told Joy not to go near the iron but she did, and then she didn't cry or tell anyone about her burn, because she was afraid of getting in trouble. Now the woman next to Joy started to cry, and grasped her hand-and Joy realized that this woman, not the one who had been doing the talking, was her birth mother. The other woman was her mother's sister.}

When Eun-hee's father came back from his service, he told her mother that he wanted a divorce. But, in Korea at that time, a child belonged to its father. Her father didn't particularly want the child, but she was his, so he took her to be raised by his parents.}

He said he couldn't talk, he had to work-he was a taxi-driver. She told him she would pay him a day's wages if he would stay with her and explain what had happened, and eventually he admitted that Eun-hee was in an orphanage.}

She knew that caseworkers were allowed to see adoption paperwork and thought that maybe if she was an employee she would be able to see hers, but she wasn't. As a caseworker in infant placement, she saw other adoptees' original birth certificates all the time. When she arranged an adoption and ordered an amended birth certificate for the child, she felt treacherous, as though she were betraying the child whose origins she was concealing.}

She saw that the birth mother was more or less disregarded once her baby had been handed over. In meetings, Angela would ask, Did anyone follow up with the birth mother? Did anyone teach her how to stop the breast milk from coming in so she isn't in pain? Her colleagues would sigh and say that this was a kind, sensitive thought, but they needed to think about the baby.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 In most states, a birth mother had a short window of time-anywhere from a few months to ninety-six hours-in which she could change her mind. As the time passed, adoptive parents would ask Angela anxiously whether she had heard from the birth mother; then, when the window had closed, they would be relieved and happy, and, although Angela understood why they felt that way, she found it hard. She talked to adoptive parents about the merits of an open adoption, and most agreed in principle, but in practice they usually didn't make an effort to keep in touch with the birth mother, or they cut her off on the ground that seeing her might be upsetting for the child. There was little enforcement of openness in adoption-it was up to them.}

She noticed that there were places in her paperwork where her birth mother's last name had not been whited out-it was Johnson. A Google search for "Deborah Johnson" in Tennessee returned several million results. She and Bryan called all the Deborah Johnsons they could find phone numbers for, dozens of them, but came up with nothing.}

Unlike her mother's name, it was unusual-Oterious. They could see by the size of the space that had been whited out that his last name was four letters long. They Googled "Oterious" and came up with one result in Tennessee: Oterious Bell. They searched on Spokeo, MySpace, Classmates.com, MyLife, and the International Soundex Reunion Registry, and finally found, on the Web site of a local radio station, a blog post, "Sandy Bell could use a lil help please." It seemed that Oterious (Sandy) Bell had become locally famous, making the rounds of bars and restaurants in Chattanooga, selling flowers. He'd just been in the hospital for a month and was struggling to pay his bills. Angela found a photo of him online. He looked exactly like her.}

Suddenly there were Black people everywhere, but she thought she sounded ridiculous with her Pacific Northwest accent. That evening, she and Bryan went to a bar and told people she was looking for Sandy Bell. One person after another told her what a character he was, with blue su\'e8de shoes and a bicycle decorated with bells, flags, and ribbons.

Looking out of the car window in Deborah's neighborhood, Angela saw abandoned vehicles and brick shotgun houses. She wondered whether the neighborhood was safe to be in. She wondered how they looked to the people she saw sitting on their stoops-an S.U.V. and a minivan pulling up to the curb. Deborah's house had black garbage bags taped over its front window. Angela had thought that they were just going to look at the house, but suddenly she saw Sandy jump out of his brother's car and walk up to the front door.

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Deanna found it tricky being a Pentecostal Christian among adoptees. Her anti-abortion views had lost her some friends, although her closest adoptee friend was pro-choice and an agnostic. It was striking how pro-choice the adoptee community was. A refrain you heard again and again, in various forms, was, Do not make more people like me. A lot of adoptees had been told by their parents that they were adopted because God put them in the wrong tummy, or that God had planned adoption for them since the foundation of the world. Because of this, they had rejected God. Deanna had been asked over and over, How are you a Christian?}

The mass adoption of foreign children by Americans had been started in the fifties by Harry and Bertha Holt, a Christian couple in Oregon whose motive was explicitly evangelical.

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 People often accused evangelicals of being not so much pro-life as pro-birth. Adoption was the answer to that: if there were unwanted babies, they would take them in. James 1:27-"Pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their trouble"-had become a central theological imperative, though nobody seemed to talk much about the widows. Many evangelicals who already had biological children adopted for religious reasons. Some even adopted children whom they knew were not orphans so that they could be raised as Christians, then return to their homes to convert others.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Congregations were told that millions of children were languishing in orphanages and might never have parents if they weren't rescued. Sometimes the price of adoption was referred to as "ransom," as though the child were a hostage. The numbers talked about grew larger and larger-after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti it was claimed that there were a million orphans there, a ninth of the total population. There were said to be a hundred and forty-three million, then a hundred and sixty-three million, then two hundred and ten million orphans in the world.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Christians responded to these terrible numbers by coming forward to adopt. But international adoptions were expensive-sometimes as much as fifty or sixty thousand dollars-and where there were lots of people willing to pay that kind of money for a child it was almost inevitable that corruption would follow. Deanna had read a book, "The Child Catchers," by Kathryn Joyce, which laid out in horrifying detail how it worked. For one thing, there was a certain motivated confusion about what an orphan was. In many countries, as in Korea, children were placed in orphanages not because they didn't have families but because their families weren't able to take care of them. Sometimes things would get better and the family would take them back. Most of the millions of orphans cited in the statistics were actually "single orphans," meaning they had one living parent.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 In many cases, a child could have returned home if the family had had a little more money-a fraction of the cost of an adoption. And some Christian charities did do family-preservation work. But, with so much money at stake, children in orphanages were being adopted abroad without their parents' knowledge, or parents were told that the child was going to America to get an education and would soon return home. Orphanages were paid part of the fees, so they had good reason to find more and more adoptable children. Some children were kidnapped from their families, sometimes by traffickers who viewed themselves as missionaries. Sometimes a well-intentioned American couple would adopt a child only to discover, much later, that the child had a family that wanted it back.}

Ethiopia and Guatemala had done so-Guatemala (which had been sending one out of every hundred of its children to America) in 2008, Ethiopia in 2018. As news of corruption in the orphan business spread in evangelical circles, and as more countries closed their adoption programs, the rates of international adoption rapidly declined. In 2021, Bethany Christian Services, one of the largest adoption agencies in the U.S., closed its international-adoption program after nearly forty years.}

Deanna believed that, except in cases of abuse or neglect, it was wrong to adopt a child unless that child had no family at all that could take it in. She tried to persuade people she knew that the thing to do was not adopt babies but give mothers what they needed to keep them. "People will say, in social-media posts, If you're pregnant and can't take care of your baby, I'll adopt them," she said. "I want to see people making ads that say, If you're pregnant and can't take care of your baby, I'm opening my checkbook, I will take you in, I will foot the bill for whatever you need." She had done that herself, taking in a child for a year while the child's mother, a relative, was in rehab. But she hadn't had much success persuading anyone else.}

A couple of years later, she joined Also-Known-As, or A.K.A.-a new organization based in New York that had been started by a friend of hers, Hollee McGinnis, to create a community of international adoptees.

In 1996, at the same time that A.K.A. was coming together, Marley Greiner, an adoptee and a reporter at the Columbus Free Press, started posting on a Usenet newsgroup, alt.adoption, and signed her posts "Bastard Nation." Later that year, Greiner helped to form a group of the same name, in the spirit of Queer Nation and ACT UP. She envisioned Yippie-style actions-mass burning of amended birth certificates, "practical jokes" on social workers. "For those of you dear readers who may think that I had a terrible adoption experience, I did not," Greiner wrote on the Bastard Nation Web site. "But the closed adoption system is a system of lies which would not be tolerated in any other forum."}

At one point, Deanna started saying to her group of searchers, He must be dead by now-we are looking for a grave. But she kept looking because, even if he was dead, there might be a sister or a brother or a cousin who could tell her what kind of man he'd been.}

A few months earlier, adult protective services had found him alone in his home in Richmond in terrible condition; they forced him into a nursing home, because he couldn't take care of himself and had no one to help.

She and Larry were living in a suburban development in Wesley Chapel, Florida, just outside Tampa. She decorated the room for Gus with mementos from his house in Richmond-a pair of two-tone wing tips, his dancing trophies, a portrait of him in his younger days-and brought him home.}

She had written a book, "You Should Be Grateful," blending her own adoption experience with those of others.

One boy referred to his birth mother, who was in prison, as Mother, and to his two adoptive mothers as Momma and Mom. Kids would talk casually about staying with their birth mother for the weekend, or their birth mother coming to watch their baseball games. To older adoptees, too anxious about hurting their adoptive parents to tell them that they read blogs about adoption, much less to search for their birth parents, this was astonishing.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 More recently, Angela had developed "Cultivating an Anti-Racist Support Network" workshops for parents who had adopted, or were thinking of adopting, kids of color. It was through one of these workshops that she had met Ali and Drew Fleming, who lived in New York. Ali and Drew knew they couldn't have a baby the ordinary way, and they had thought that adoption was the ethical alternative. Since Drew and his family were white but Ali's family was from India, they had signed up for Angela's workshop to prepare the ground for their interracial family.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 They had first thought of adopting from India, but then they realized that that would make it nearly impossible for the child to know its birth parents, and they had heard about corruption problems in international adoption, so they started looking domestically. They hired an adoption attorney, who recommended that they not go through an agency, because an agency could demand tens of thousands of dollars up front which they wouldn't get back, even if they never got a child. Ali also discovered that, if a woman agreed to give them her baby when it was born, the agency would ask for still more money, which they would not get back either, even if the woman changed her mind. That was bad not only because they might spend tens of thousands of dollars for no baby, but also because it was so much money that it could give the woman the impression that the couple had already bought her baby, and feel pressured to relinquish. No, the attorney said, they should try to find a mother on their own.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 There were ways to do this. They sent letters to churches and pregnancy crisis centers and ob-gyn offices, but Ali and Drew were pro-choice and this felt predatory to them. They created a Web site advertising themselves as potential parents-he was a doctor, she was a math teacher, they had two dogs, surely all that would look good. They hired adoption consultants who taught them how to run ads on Facebook and Instagram that targeted women who were looking for parents. Ali was advised to spell her name Allie so it didn't sound Middle Eastern. They were advised not to post any photos of Indian holidays on their Web site, but that there should be a Christmas tree.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 They were contacted by about thirty women. Some were scams, but in most cases, as far as she could tell, the women were really pregnant. Most already had kids. Ali spent hours texting with the women and talking to them on video calls. Many of them were conflicted about giving up their baby. In many cases what was preventing them from keeping it was a relatively small amount of money-a couple of thousand dollars. She kept talking women out of placing their baby, though she realized that this was counterproductive. The more women she talked to, the less she could imagine a situation where it would be better for both mother and baby if the baby came to her.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 By this time, she and Drew were starting to feel nauseated and sullied by the adoption business. Reading around online, Ali had discovered that there was a "second chance" re-homing adoption market, for children whom parents had adopted but didn't want anymore, or couldn't keep. These tended to be older children, often from other countries. Their situation was so bleak, Ali could barely think about it. They contacted their attorney and asked about surrogacy.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 When Ali DM'd Angela on Instagram to say that they had decided not to adopt after all, Angela was glad. In her conversations with prospective parents, she tried to make them see how fraught transracial adoption was. She told parents that getting a Black doll for your child, taking them to an Ethiopian restaurant, sending them to transracial-adoptee summer camp, was not enough. All that just produced a sense that you were performing Blackness, Angela would say. What Black children needed was actual Black people in their lives. Most people who found their way to her were going to agree with that, but making it happen was another matter. She said, "I hear almost every day in my consults with white parents, We know we should have Black and brown kids in our kids' lives, but, like, how do we find them, and what do we say when we see one?"}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Some years before, Angela had given a talk at a conference and told the story of her adoption by white parents, and afterward an older Black woman came up to her. You are my worst fear realized, the woman said. You aren't a true Black person. I'm sorry the system erased you from our culture. Angela was stricken. The woman had introduced herself as a member of the National Association of Black Social Workers, which in 1972 had issued a manifesto condemning transracial adoption. "Only a Black family," it stated, "can transmit the emotional and sensitive subtleties of perception and reaction essential for a Black child's survival in a racist society."}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Angela no longer believed that there was such a thing as a true Black person-she felt more confident in her Blackness. And, whereas when she was younger she had believed that transracial adoptees were less truly Black than people raised in Black families, she now felt that the experience of growing up Black in a white home spoke to the core of what it meant to be Black in America.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 On the other hand, she had begun to wonder whether the National Association of Black Social Workers might have been partly right-that transracial adoption should happen only as a last resort. She loved her adoptive parents, and was grateful\~to them for supporting her wholeheartedly in her search for her birth parents, and even in her questioning of transracial adoption. But she also wished she wasn't adopted. It was so difficult to explain that to most people.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 She found that people tended to understand the problems of transracial adoption more readily in the context of Native Americans. She was closely watching a Supreme Court case, Haaland v. Brackeen, which had been argued before the Court in November, 2022. The Brackeens were a white couple who had adopted a Navajo boy and wanted to adopt his half sister, too. They had filed suit to challenge the 1978 Indian Child Welfare Act, which made it difficult for outsiders to adopt a Native American child. They argued that the law was unconstitutional, because it discriminated on the basis of race. The Indian Child Welfare Act was a response to the removal of as many as a third of Native American children from their families, to be placed in deracinating boarding schools (a guiding motto was "Kill the Indian, save the man") and, later, in the mid-twentieth century, in adoptive homes. Angela knew that Native Americans were a special case, but she thought it was possible that Haaland v. Brackeen would lead people to think differently about transracial adoption in general.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 She had started to push against it in her work, but it was going to be difficult. In the early nineteen-seventies, at the time of the National Association of Black Social Workers manifesto, transracial adoption was rare-adoptions of Black children by white parents made up about one per cent of all adoptions. Now it was widespread-more than half of Black adoptees were adopted by non-Black families. "I was consulting with this white woman who wants to adopt, and she was, like, I don't think I'm the best person to adopt a Black kid," she said. "And I was, like, Great, tell your agency. This is the struggle, nothing will change until you stick by your principles. But white people are not going to do that, because white guilt starts to come out."}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 For decades, agencies had been constrained by the 1994 Multiethnic Placement Act, which restricted how agencies could consider race in placements, but now some were pushing back. Bethany Christian Services had issued a statement that the act should be overhauled and race should be considered in adoption. Angela had consulted for one agency in Indiana which asked white people seeking to adopt children of color whether they lived in a racially diverse town, had identified a school in that town with both teachers of color and white teachers, and had found a multiracial church.}
{\rtlch\afs24\ltrch\fs24\par}\pard\plain\itap0\s0\fi0\sb200\sa0\aspalpha\aspnum\adjustright\ltrpar\li0\lin0\ri0\rin0\qj\faauto\sl260\slmult0\rtlch\afs24\ltrch\fs24{\rtlch\af2\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\b0\i0\fs20\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033
\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 All of this seemed good to Angela; but what would happen to a Black child if an agency couldn't find it a Black family, as had happened with her? There were twenty-five thousand Black kids in foster care whose parents' rights had been terminated-what about them? Now that Angela had met her Black relatives, she saw that her birth father's family could have raised her-agencies didn't try nearly hard enough to find fathers. But her situation, having been given up for adoption, was unusual: the rate of never-married Black women voluntarily relinquishing babies had been close to zero for decades. Many of the Black kids in foster care were there not because their parents had given them up but because they had been taken from parents who very much wanted them, by child-protective services. And most of those children had been removed not because of abuse but due to "neglect," which could mean a lot of things-unsafe housing, not enough food, leaving kids home alone, missing doctors' appointments-that were often consequences of poverty. So was adoption a way for those kids to have permanent families? Or was it the escape valve that allowed the child-protection system to continue removing children from their parents without fully reckoning with the cost? It was both.}

Some are jealous of their own children-jealous of their own love. Some adoptees of color have had the experience, even years after growing up in a white family, of catching sight of themselves in a mirror or a shop window and thinking, Who's that? Many adoptees have a persistent sense that they don't exist, or aren't real, or aren't human-that they weren't born from a woman but came from nowhere, or from space. Some picture themselves being birthed by a building-the hospital that was recorded on their paperwork.}

"Even if you know cognitively that's not true, no one can prove to you that it's not true. If, for the time before you landed in J.F.K., if the paperwork is inaccurate, if the story is falsified, if there are no witnesses, if there's no documentation, there are no photographs, nothing-that can really fuck people up." Some adoptees felt that way even when there was no missing time. "I remember working with a domestic adoptee whose parents were in the delivery room at the time of their birth, and they were literally handed over by the birth mother," she said. "I met them when they were a teen-ager. They actually had by that time reunited with their birth mother, and all they talked about was, I have no idea who I am, I feel like I'm walking around with a mask on my face."}

"There's one theory that if the birth mother knew she was going to relinquish, is there an intrauterine hormonal shift that begins to-were there different kinds of hormones that flowed in the amniotic fluid? Maybe." It was known that cortisol levels in the amniotic fluid rose if the mother was experiencing prolonged stress. "Should the handoff have been so easy? Should the mother have nursed the baby? At what point did the baby feel, Wait a minute, this isn't right, I'm missing something? Could it be that the adoptive parents had intense years of infertility, and was the adoptive mom depressed and maybe not really attaching to the baby, even though she desperately wanted it? There are so many factors we don't know."}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Perhaps because she had lived with her mother for the first three years of her life, she did not have that feeling that she didn't exist, but she felt something similar. "Loneliness feels more accurate to describe my experience," she said. "One minute I'm here, the next minute I'm there-these leaps of time and space and cultures, there's nothing that connects it. There are swaths of time that don't exist in my consciousness, and don't exist in anyone's consciousness. My birth mother only knows me from zero to three. There is no person that can account for my entire existence."}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Over the years, Joy had tried to build a relationship with her birth mother, but it wasn't easy. They sometimes texted each other on a group chat with her brother, but the texts felt formal and generic-good wishes and emojis. Joy felt that she was still basically a stranger.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 In 2008, her birth mother and brother came to stay with her and her husband and two kids in their small apartment. She thought they would come for maybe four weeks, but they stayed for three months. She had heard from other adoptees that their birth mothers were nosy and couldn't stop touching them, but her mother was the opposite. She was quiet and passive. She didn't seem curious about anything. Even though by that point Joy's Korean was very good, Joy found she couldn't talk to her. She still barely looked at her. All that had been O.K. when Joy paid her short visits in Korea, but when they were crowded in together for that long in her own space it made her furious. One day, she blew up. She said, You have been living in my house for six weeks and you haven't asked me a single question. You don't want to know anything about me. Her mother started to cry. She said, You are out of my life. I just wanted to know where you were.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 When her mother left to go back to Korea, Joy was glad to see her go. She didn't really feel like staying in touch, but she figured she would do so for her kids' sake. In the years after the visit, she reconciled herself to their relationship being what it was. Now all she wanted was to sit with her mother one more time without asking for anything. "I don't need any more clarity on the past," she said. "I'm perfectly fine with going out to dinner. I can't- The ship has passed of trying to get her to understand me."}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Although she felt no closer to her birth mother, Joy did feel more Korean. There were a lot of Koreans in her neighborhood, and her spoken Korean was good enough now that she could chat with mothers on the playground and they never knew she was not as Korean as they were. They would ask her if she celebrated Thanksgiving, and were surprised that she knew about pumpkin pie. When she walked down the street with her husband now, she thought, We are a full Korean couple. It was weird. She had always felt more like an adoptee than anything else.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 As she grew older, and fewer and fewer children were adopted from Korea, she realized that at some point the small culture she was part of would die out. "It's just a matter of time," she said. "In the long history of humanity, we will exist only in a span of sixty or seventy years." She felt that she had to keep talking about that experience or it would all be lost. She had been interviewed on video as part of KoreanAmericanStory.org's Legacy Project, and for the Side by Side project, both extensive film archives of Korean adoptees telling the stories of their lives. She had created an online adoptee community, IAMAdoptee.org.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 She had heard that several hundred Korean adoptees, led by a Korean Danish lawyer, were demanding that the Korean government investigate how they had come to be adopted-if government orphanages had lied about whether they had families, or falsified their paperwork, making them harder to find. But she knew that most of her fellows weren't interested in the history of Korean adoptions the way she was. None of her three sisters had tried to find their birth parents, or had even been to Korea. This was normal. Even the largest Korean adoptee group on Facebook had only about seven thousand members, and if you added others you got maybe twice that. But about two hundred thousand Korean children had been adopted overseas. Where was everybody else?}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Soon, all that would remain of those couple of hundred thousand Korean children would be some documents that would end up in libraries, dissertations, and family albums. "How many adoptees in my generation were plastered on the Living section of their local newspaper?" she said. "Probably thousands of us. We were the sensation of the town. We all have a newspaper clipping of the arrival of the children from Korea. And in it the parents are happy and the babies all look traumatized. I look at my arrival pictures now, and I'm just, like, that poor kid-no one explained to her what the hell's going on."}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 When she thought now about that bewildered child at the airport in 1976 in her peacock dress, her nose all bloody, she found that she thought about her in the third person. "I don't really think about this as me anymore," she said. "I don't know. Honestly, I don't think I can think about it in the first person, because I think that would.\~.\~.\~." She paused. "She's had to stay in the past," she said. "I don't know that I could bring her here."\~\u9830 }
