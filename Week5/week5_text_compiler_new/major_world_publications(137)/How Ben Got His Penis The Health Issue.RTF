Raised in a village outside the Finger Lakes \u8212  a place, to this day, where cell service is spotty \u8212  he did not know what \u8220 transgender\u8221  was. As a young girl, he assumed he would become a man when he grew up. When he realized he would not, he forgot the whole idea and started collecting other evidence to explain why something in his life always felt off.}

Next came the lesbian rumors at school. (Though Ben did know that he liked girls, he did not feel like a lesbian at all.) To combat the gossip, he started dressing girlier and tried having sex with boys a few times. His interest in their bodies was more appraising than erotic. Browsing a Myspace group for lesbians, he found himself yearning for a clear identity. Where did he fit in the scheme of the world? Incomprehensible to himself, he tried a few times to end his own life. Soon after, he went looking for himself at New York University.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Ben arrived at college in 2009. There, he started calling himself a \u8220 queer lesbian,\u8221  a term he used in an attempt to reconcile his attraction to women with his interest in men\u8217 s bodies. He joined a campus L.G.B.T. group and met people who seemed to know who they were, who called themselves things like \u8220 gender-fluid\u8221  or used \u8220 ze\u8221 /\u8220 zir\u8221  pronouns. Ben did not feel that these words applied to him, but for the first time he had community and language to help him disentangle himself. This was a stressful and exciting interlude. He went out in outfits from across the gender spectrum, in clothes he wouldn\u8217 t dream of putting on today. He had long debates over terms: What was the difference between a butch lesbian and a transgender man? What was the reason to use these words at all?}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 In the spring of 2015, Ben got happy hour drinks with two friends at a Midtown barbecue spot. The setup was the usual \u8212  sitting at the bar, dissecting sex and gender, putting the pieces together again. They had done this many times before, but this time something clicked, and suddenly Ben understood he was a man. He stood up from the bar and told his friends: \u8220 [Expletive]! I\u8217 m trans! I gotta go!\u8221  Out in the street, he took off his heels and ran five sobbing blocks to the train. That night, he began the bureaucratic work of transition: texting his mother, posting a Facebook status, scheduling a doctor\u8217 s appointment to start testosterone.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Shortly after that, Ben dropped out of college and moved to North Carolina with his cousin. There he began his life as a man, working at a hotel, wearing a uniform and smiling when Southern types called him \u8220 son.\u8221  The state\u8217 s so-called bathroom bill drove him back to his hometown; in North Carolina, neither restroom felt safe. Back in New York State, he could finally unclench, secure in the knowledge that he wasn\u8217 t just a man but a certain kind of man who belonged out in the country. College had expanded his knowledge of gender; now, finally, he could narrow it down. In 2017, he had \u8220 top surgery,\u8221  or a gender-affirming double mastectomy. As far as he knew, his transition was complete. His gender dysphoria was manageable. He felt fine about his sex life. Though he had read about \u8220 bottom surgery\u8221  online, the final outcomes did not seem good enough for him to justify the risks. People were comparing the results to soda cans, he recalls. \u8220 They were saying they weren\u8217 t functional. You couldn\u8217 t pee out of them. You couldn\u8217 t feel anything.\u8221 }

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 His calculus changed one night later that year, out with some friends at the local college dive. The place was filthy. Management had removed the bathroom stalls to keep people from doing cocaine. An undefended toilet next to a urinal is not an ideal place for a trans man to take a leak, but Ben was confident \u8212  and had to go. He walked past a guy using the urinal and quickly unzipped to sit on the toilet. The man kept his eyes to himself (the men\u8217 s room code), but as he left, he told the people waiting: \u8220 It\u8217 s going to be a while. That guy just sat down.\u8221 }

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 This was hardly an incitement to anti-trans harassment \u8212  he just thought Ben was taking a dump. Even so, as Ben sat there pretending to go, he pictured a more hostile group of drunken men and how they might react to the absence of his penis. Bathroom bills were on the rise, and every day for the rest of his life, taking a leak would mean managing risk. He was just 26 \u8212  still quite young. Looking ahead at a lifetime of this, the downsides of surgery suddenly seemed reasonable. Having a penis would help him feel safe, even if he still had to sit down in a stall. \u8220 I felt that any complication that would arise, including dying, was better than the alternative,\u8221  he says. That night, drunk at home, he ran a search for \u8220 FTM bottom surgery\u8221  and spent all night reading up on phalloplasty. The following week, he submitted a request for a consultation with Dr. Rachel Bluebond-Langner at N.Y.U. Langone.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Phalloplasty, or surgery to construct a penis, is one of medicine\u8217 s most complex procedures. Though it technically refers to one step in a long process \u8212  the construction of a phallus from a flap of one\u8217 s own skin \u8212  the term is used more generally to describe a suite of modular surgeries, each attending to a different penile function. The penis, as an organ, is idiosyncratic, assigned to a seemingly random set of duties that you might not group together if designing it from scratch. The heart pumps blood; the stomach digests food. The penis procreates, urinates and transmits pleasure. It reacts to temperature, emotion and touch \u8212  a complex assemblage of tubes, tissue and nerve, configured in the awkward crook of space between the legs.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 The main recipients of phalloplasty are transgender men and nonbinary people, intersex people and cisgender men with penile injuries. These groups can have different starting anatomy, but in general, the surgical techniques are the same. Beyond the initial construction of the shaft, a phalloplasty might also include extending the urethra, creating a scrotum, defining the glans, adding testicular prostheses or inserting an erectile implant. Depending on the combination of procedures, a penis might take a couple of years to complete, involving many surgical stages and revisions and a long-term commitment to organizing life around access to doctors, insurance coverage, time off from work and postoperative care. For trans patients, the risk of complications is high \u8212  according to surgeons I spoke with, about 70 percent. (The small patient pool and customizable nature of the procedure pose challenges for empirical analysis.) Nevertheless, patient satisfaction rates are high. According to one report, presented at the 2012 Canadian Professional Association for Transgender Health Conference, which analyzed 29 studies of gender-affirming phalloplasty from 1980 to 2012, it is as high as 97 percent. In a 2021 survey published in The Journal of Sexual Medicine, which asked 79 patients to respond on a seven-point scale to the statement \u8220 I feel positively about my genitals,\u8221  transgender men who had completed at least one stage of phalloplasty scored equal to cisgender men.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Phalloplasty for trans men and nonbinary people \u8212  known in medicine as gender-affirming phalloplasty \u8212  has existed in some form since at least the 1940s, but until recently, it was rare in the United States, where insurance coverage was unreliable and few surgeons catered to the needs of trans patients. Some trans men traveled to Belgium, Serbia or Thailand, where care was both cheaper and easier to access; those who did have surgery in the United States often paid tens of thousands of dollars, forcing them to choose between a penis and a house (if they were well-off enough to face this choice at all). As hormones and top surgery became standard forms of health care, a penis remained an unlikely prospect, even to some who wanted it badly.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Today, both access and attitudes are changing, thanks to efforts in peer education, recent advancements in surgical technique and, most consequential, the Affordable Care Act, which prohibits health programs that receive federal funding from discriminating on the basis of certain federally protected criteria, including sex. When the act passed in 2010, it was not immediately clear whether nondiscrimination would ultimately apply to transgender health care. The law protected sex, but not transgender status in particular, starting a 10-year legal dispute about whether one implied the other. This question intersected with some of the most hotly contested axes of American civil rights, including the freedom of religious organizations that receive federal funding.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 The Supreme Court\u8217 s Bostock v. Clayton County decision, handed down in 2020, resolved this ambiguity, at least for the time being: Transgender status is now understood to fall under the umbrella of sex, which in turn makes it a protected civil right, which in turn mandates coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Today, according to the L.G.B.T. organization Movement Advancement Project, Medicaid programs in 24 states explicitly cover transition-related care. Many companies \u8212  McDonald\u8217 s, Starbucks, Amazon and more \u8212  have begun offering insurance plans that follow suit, a sea change that puts phalloplasty within reach for more trans Americans than ever. Without insurance, phalloplasty would cost the patient as much as $200,000 from start to finish.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 According to the most recent prepandemic data from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, some 1,100 people in the United States had gender-affirming phalloplasty in 2019. This number is probably low, considering the modular nature of the procedure and inconsistencies in how data is reported. Surgeons at all four programs I spoke with confirmed that phalloplasty is on the rise. All claimed wait lists of over a year. This increase in surgery has set off a frenzied cycle: better access, new techniques and more doctors, but also an influx of less-experienced doctors and urgent calls for better analysis of outcomes to help bring down the complication rate. This narrative unfolds within a mass cultural one, in which America, at a larger scale than ever, tries to come to terms with what defines a man or a woman. In this context, phalloplasty occupies an impossible position, seemingly upholding both the malleability of sex and the essentialist claim that the penis makes the man.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 In the six months before his phallo consultation, Ben spent a lot of time doing research. At first, his expectations were low; he could have been happy with a \u8220 frankenweenie,\u8221  he says, so long as it let him use the bathroom in peace. He scrutinized post-op photographs online, learning about the different techniques and their trade-offs. Though phalloplasty cannot yet produce a penis identical to the one most men are born with, it can provide for many of the classic penile pastimes: standing urination, penetrative sex, orgasm (without ejaculation), changing in a locker room. These prospects far exceeded Ben\u8217 s initial expectations. Many outcomes looked more than just fine to him; they looked great. Still, he was afraid to indulge in optimism. He needed rigor \u8212  candidness and data and photos of healing wounds. He found very little in mainstream trans resources. The search led him to a network of private Facebook groups, known to most people as \u8220 the phallo groups.\u8221 }

Here, people of seemingly every class and creed, hailing from every corner of the nation, unite to discuss their shared investment in the penis. The largest group was founded in January 2015, as post-Affordable Care Act phalloplasty picked up steam; it now has more than 17,000 members at every stage in the surgical journey, from post-op down to just kicking tires. Wisdom is handed down through generations as individual members volunteer their time to offer the frankness that medicine cannot.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Newcomers to the phallo groups often show up with some version of the question, \u8220 Which surgeon should I go to for the best penis?\u8221  Gently, an elder member might ask, \u8220 What do you mean when you say the \u8216 best penis\u8217 ?\u8221  In the United States, there are two common types of phalloplasty: radial forearm flap (or R.F.F., which uses the forearm as a skin-flap donor site) and anterolateral thigh (or ALT, which uses the thigh). These flaps form the shaft and can be combined with various other procedures in pursuit of four major post-op priorities: standing urination, aesthetics, erectile function and sensation. Most surgeons begin by asking patients to rank these priorities. Though it is possible to achieve all four at once, the high complication rate means nothing is certain.}

There is also a surgery photo-sharing site where you can find thousands of user-submitted post-op pics \u8212  from the front, from the side; with testicles, or without; on fat guys, on thin guys; on tall guys, on short guys; on medium-size nonbinary people. Choosing what type of phalloplasty you want is not just choosing the penis itself, but choosing the shape of your life for a few years \u8212  your budget, your job, your freedom to travel, your ability to reserve enough time to recover.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Once group members have a sense of what they want, the next questions are often geographic: Does anyone know a good surgeon in Ohio? Near Albuquerque? In northeastern Indiana? Has anyone gone to Curtis Crane in Austin? Mang Chen in San Francisco? Loren Schechter in Chicago? Having surgery close to home is more convenient and allows for a better attended healing process. Even so, many patients must traverse state lines in order to access competent care. This means recovering in a hotel \u8212  a major inconvenience and significant expense. To help bring down the cost, the groups offer guidance on maximizing all sorts of arcane systems, from hotel rewards to credit-card points to hospital indemnity insurance. Such mastery of capitalist subjecthood feels unexpected from a group so often portrayed as socially deviant.}

Langone\u8217 s transgender-surgery program, he researched the differences between ALT and R.F.F. The thigh\u8217 s skin is longer and tends to have more fat, which can add girth to the penis, for better or for worse. The forearm\u8217 s skin, by contrast, is shorter and leaner. The scar it leaves behind is more visible. Both procedures have similar complication rates. Ben\u8217 s primary goal was standing urination.

Others are rarer and more severe, like rectal injury during vaginectomy or loss of the new penis by necrosis. (Bluebond-Langner has had this happen once in her career.) Ben knew people from the phallo groups who had stuck with the surgery through both excruciating complications and minor but persistently annoying disappointments. To him, these were acceptable risks.

Though the fundamentals of plastics \u8212  sewing, grafting, tissue expansion, flaps \u8212  are used in most gender-affirming procedures, it was still very hard to find targeted instruction in facial feminization, chest masculinization and the finer points of serving a population with a fraught relationship with medicine. Most gender surgeons in practice at that time had cobbled together their own paths into the field, completing a formal plastic-surgery training and then studying under other gender surgeons or seeking out additional training in outside specialties to master techniques that might be useful in their work. Pursuing this work was stigmatized. Some surgeons maintained separate websites: one for their mainstream practice, and one for their transgender clientele.}

This training took her all over the world: to Thailand and Canada to study vaginoplasty and to Mexico City, where she learned microsurgery, the technique that facilitates skin-flap transfer by connecting nerves and vessels on a microscopic scale. She began performing complex urogenital surgeries, including phalloplasty for micropenis and trauma. At the University of Maryland in 2016, she performed her first gender-affirming phalloplasty. The surgery, as far as she knows, was a success. (She and the patient lost touch after two years.) A few years before, Rodriguez had moved to N.Y.U.

In the early days of formalized transgender medicine in the United States \u8212  a period between roughly 1960 and 1980 \u8212  phalloplasty was rare and pretty much one-size-fits-all, with its goal being to replicate the idealized form and function of an imagined standard American penis.

There are partial interventions that can help achieve this goal while also minimizing risk. One patient, for instance, might choose to pursue standing urination but have no practical use for an erectile implant. Another might experience dysphoria as mainly visual but still enjoy vaginal receptive intercourse; phalloplasty without vaginectomy could meet this need with fewer procedures. \u8220 You can do glansplasty, no glansplasty. Scrotoplasty, no scrotoplasty. You can really do a whole mix-and-match thing to meet your goals,\u8221  Bluebond-Langner said.}

Bluebond-Langner\u8217 s phalloplasty patients are generally young, between roughly 18 and 32. The F.D.A.-approved erectile implants are designed for the bodies of cisgender men. The one trans-specific implant is not approved in the United States, but even if it were, there is not yet a standard way to measure or report what makes for good surgical outcomes.

Dillon\u8217 s penis was constructed using Gillies\u8217 s tubed-pedicle method, which here involved lifting a flap of skin, shaping it into a phallus and letting it heal while attached at both ends, dangling from the abdomen like a suitcase handle. While healing in this state, Dillon finished medical school. Some time after the pedicle reached its intended destination, he quit medicine, bounced around a series of Buddhist monasteries in India, changed his name to Jivaka and settled down to write his autobiography. Of the completed penis, he wrote only: \u8220 How different was life now! I could walk past anyone and not fear to hear any comments for no one looked at me twice.\u8221  Gillies was happy with the surgery too.

Admission was limited to patients with the greatest chances of succeeding in life as employed heterosexual men or women.

For trans men, testosterone and mastectomy were common, but genital surgeries remained rare, in part because phalloplasty had only minimally evolved beyond Gillies\u8217 s tubed pedicle of the 1940s. In a 1978 paper, \u8220 Construction of Male Genitalia,\u8221  researchers from Stanford\u8217 s gender clinic wrote, \u8220 In the female-to-male transsexual, the objective of the surgical program is to construct a penis and all the external male genitalia including the scrotum, with implantation of testicular prostheses.\u8221  By this standard \u8212  and often the standards of the patients themselves \u8212  the penises of the late midcentury could hardly be described as a success. They rarely allowed for standing urination, and sexual sensation was regarded as incidental. For those who wanted one anyway, the barriers were nearly insurmountable. In the gender-clinic era, care was free, but only to model patients. With the demise of the clinics, surgery became available on the free market, but only to those with the necessary cash and time to negotiate bureaucracy. A domestic phalloplasty in that time cost more than most people\u8217 s annual salary.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Nevertheless, the procedure itself began to improve in the \u8217 80s with the gradual advancement of microsurgery. By linking blood vessels on a microscopic scale, it opened the door for phalloplasty with a lower rate of loss and an increased capacity for both sexual and tactile sensation. By this point, trans men had begun communicating with one another through a small but robust network of newsletters \u8212  FTM Newsletter, Twenty Minutes \u8212  which covered these medical advancements with great hope. Progress was slow and often disappointing. Microsurgical technique would not truly mature until the period after 1998, when the Women\u8217 s Health and Cancer Rights Act began requiring insurance coverage for post-mastectomy breast reconstruction. The enormous increase in free-flap breast surgeries \u8212  arguably itself a form of gender-affirming care \u8212  advanced microsurgery\u8217 s sophistication, allowing the modern phalloplasty to be born.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 As Ben prepared for Stage\u8201 1 surgery, he told only his family and close friends. He knew that acceptance from some people in his life would hinge on every step going smoothly, and found himself acutely aware of a mandate to justify his desires. Though surgery today can construct a penis, it cannot reconcile millenniums of phallic anxiety: the tangled bond between penises and manhood; the supposedly inherent violence of the penis; the sense of the vagina as its wanting opposite; the feminist call to destroy gender essentialism. Even among trans men themselves, phalloplasty remains a highly scrutinized desire. It is easy to stand up for some vague and glittery right to gender self-determination; fighting for the penis is like rooting for the Yankees.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 On the day of the surgery, Ben woke up in a hotel and checked into the hospital, where he changed into a gown and sat watching the Cartoon Network. He felt as if he were waiting forever. At 12:30 p.m., he was taken into the operating room and put under anesthesia. Six hours later, Stage 1 was done. Despite all the poking and prodding from doctors, and the swelling, and the wound on his thigh, and the drugs, the new penis felt like his right away. \u8220 I\u8217 d never had a penis before,\u8221  he says, \u8220 but once I had it, it just made sense that it was there.\u8221  The next few days were mostly pain and small achievements: first time standing up (May 11), removal of the catheter (May 13), discharge from the hospital (May 14). Even simple tasks were made better by the presence of his newly formed appendage. \u8220 Shower was AWESOME!!!\u8221  he posted to Facebook. \u8220 I got to hold my dick a bunch of times.\u8221 }

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 After leaving the hospital, Ben spent two weeks recovering in a long-term-stay hotel in New Jersey. At his first post-op appointment with Bluebond-Langner and Zhao, he handed out bubble-gum \u8220 It\u8217 s a boy!\u8221  cigars. At that point, his penis was really just a tube \u8212  as featureless and smooth as a sea cucumber. In Stage 2, five months later, the team began laying the groundwork for an organ with increased functionality. This surgery began with Bluebond-Langner\u8217 s removing Ben\u8217 s vagina. (He\u8217 d already had a hysterectomy in preparation for Stage 1.) Next, in what is perhaps the surgery\u8217 s most gruesome stage, she sliced his penis lengthwise up the underside and lined the open face with more tissue from his thigh. This surface would someday form his new urethra, but first this tissue graft had to heal. Ben\u8217 s recovery coincided with the arrival of the pandemic, and he lived for more than seven months with his penis splayed open. \u8220 The \u8216 hot-dog bun\u8217  stage was the hardest stage for me,\u8221  he said. \u8220 Healing is a weird thing in general, but especially when you have this big open wound on something as important and sensitive as your genitals. It can be scary. You\u8217 re seeing lots of colors. You\u8217 re seeing lots of fluids. You\u8217 re smelling lots of things.\u8221 }

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 In May 2020, Bluebond-Langner stitched up the channel, connecting his existing urethra to his new one. At age 28, Ben was potty-trained again, teaching himself to pee standing up with a children\u8217 s urinal suctioned to the wall of his shower. (\u8220 When you hit the target,\u8221  he told me, \u8220 it would spin.\u8221 ) He first used a public urinal a few months later, on crab-leg night at a restaurant in his hometown. (\u8220 My stepdad was like: \u8216 Oh, yeah! Go, Ben!\u8217 \u8221 ) A few months later, in the Port Authority Bus Terminal, a stranger wondered aloud if he was in the wrong bathroom. \u8220 I was like, \u8216 Want to see my dick, bro?\u8217 \u8221  The man apologized, and Ben relieved himself, relieved. By this measure alone, the surgery was a success. Moreover, Ben\u8217 s goals had been drastically exceeded.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 I spoke to Ben on and off over those months. Though he did not yet have his erectile implant, he was starting to feel optimistic about his future sex life. Through various \u8220 American Pie\u8221 -style experiments involving multiple condoms for stability and a sex toy from an online store called Cherry Pie, he already knew he could feel a few sensations \u8212  hot, cold, tactile, erogenous. The implant he wanted, the Coloplast Titan pump, would allow him to elicit an erection on demand by squeezing a device inside his scrotal sack. Ben hoped to get the implant \u8212  and a matching silicon testicle \u8212  sometime in early 2022, but before that he wanted to address two complications. First, his urine stream had grown weak, and he worried he might have a urethral stricture. Second, his penis was still very thick \u8212  far too thick to put his hand around.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 In March 2021, Ben took an overnight bus to New York to consult with Bluebond-Langner and Zhao about these post-surgical concerns. I met him at the hospital at 8 a.m., each of us clutching a giant iced coffee. Even after a bad night\u8217 s sleep across two bus seats, Ben had a game and smooth-talking air, making wholesome, flirty chitchat with everyone he met. We went upstairs to the waiting room, where he handed out cupcakes to the office staff.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Inside the examination room, a nurse instructed Ben to get undressed from the waist down. I offered to excuse myself, but Ben said it was fine to stay. He dropped his pants and pulled on a gown. His penis was a respectable length by any measure. It was thicker and paler than any I had personally seen, but it otherwise looked unremarkably handsome.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Bluebond-Langner appeared in the door, followed by a pod of white-coated observers. Before Ben could say hello, she crouched down. \u8220 Looking good!\u8221  she exclaimed. \u8220 Did we take photos?\u8221  She took out her phone and snapped a few shots while listening to Ben\u8217 s concerns about his girth. She agreed they should excise some fat before implanting his erectile device. Ben stood up and put on his clothes. I followed him to another exam room, where Zhao would look inside his penis with a camera. A nurse produced a syringe of numbing gel and shot it up the length of Ben\u8217 s urethra. As he sat waiting for his penis to go numb, he asked me to pass him his cup of iced coffee.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Zhao threaded the camera inside, and soon Ben\u8217 s urethra appeared across four screens. Ben pointed at some squiggles. \u8220 Are those hairs?\u8221  he asked. Zhao said they were, from what used to be his thigh, but they weren\u8217 t thick enough to affect the flow of urine. He fished the camera deeper until he met resistance. \u8220 There\u8217 s just a tiny bit of a narrowing,\u8221  he said. It was only scar tissue. Massaging the spot from the outside would help break it up and improve his urine flow. This was all good news. Ben put on his clothes and tossed his drained iced coffee in the trash.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Ben went in for his \u8220 debulking\u8221  procedure that summer. His penis didn\u8217 t turn out as slender as he wanted, but finally he could grasp it in one hand. Describing the risks of further debulking, he repeated to me what Zhao had said to him: \u8220 Better is the enemy of good.\u8221  In March of this year, he returned for his final implant surgery and emerged from the hospital semi-erect; his penis had to heal with the pump partly inflated. By April, when we met again at N.Y.U. Langone, he was excited to get hard, but more excited to go soft. A month at half-staff had been somewhat awkward.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Zhao was waiting in the examination room for a post-op lesson in inflating and deflating. He put on a pair of purple nitrile gloves and lifted Ben\u8217 s penis up with his right hand. With the other, he gently grasped Ben\u8217 s scrotum and started to explain how the implant was designed. There was now a small reservoir filled with saline embedded in Ben\u8217 s groin. Inside his scrotum was a testicle-shaped bulb, which pushed the saline into a tube running down the length of his penis.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf2 Zhao pinched the bottom of the pump a couple of times, and Ben\u8217 s penis stiffened. He moved the skin back and forth a little bit, to show how robust the whole mechanism was. \u8220 Now let\u8217 s try to deflate it,\u8221  Zhao said. Ben squeezed the pump inside his scrotum with his right hand. With the left, he began to compress his shaft like an accordion, pushing the saline back into the reservoir. Zhao said he should feel a \u8220 whooshing\u8221  sensation. After a few seconds, he gave a final push, and the penis flopped over, triumphantly flaccid.}

A few minutes later, Ben took out his phone and put on King Missile\u8217 s college-radio standard, \u8220 Detachable Penis,\u8221  which he said reminded him of his life before phalloplasty. He reflected on how surgery had changed him. The whole thing had taken just over four years, and in that time, his confidence improved. His relationship with his family had changed. His penis had improved his relationship to manhood, allowing him to inhabit the role with much less friction. He had told me in another conversation that this made sense for a small-town guy like him, but half-joked that it made him \u8220 a bad trans.\u8221 }
