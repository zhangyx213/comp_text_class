STRAUCH--Berish (Bob). Bob passed away at the age of 90 on December 24, 2023. Loving husband of Rena for 68 years, who pre-deceased him by only eight weeks, proud father of Robert (Laura) and Laurie (David), grandfather to David, Kimberly (Philip), Carolyn (Gabriel), Alexandra, Matthew, Julia, and Jason. Beloved brother of Renee and Jack. Cherished member of the extended Feuerstein family. Born on September 19, 1933, to Herman and Anna, Bob grew up in the South Bronx watching his father cut suits in the Garment District and knew he wanted to be a surgeon. 
He attended the Bronx High School of Science, often describing this as setting the course for the rest of his life. From there, he helped support himself through Columbia College by selling encyclopedias door-to-door, becoming the top regional seller. This experience proved invaluable throughout his life and honed his persuasive skills. He met the love of his life, Rena Feuerstein, at a freshmen dance. That evening, he told his sister Renee that he had found the girl he was going to marry, and he did. Bob became the sixth Feuerstein brother, and Rena's parents were as dear to him as his own. While dedicated to his growing family, Bob embarked on his surgical career. He graduated from Columbia Medical School, completed a general surgery residency at Montefiore Medical Center, and a hand surgery fellowship with the renowned Dr. William Littler at the Roosevelt Hospital. He enlisted in the U.S. Army and served as a Captain in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and Sagamihara, Japan, taking his family with him. Upon returning to the U.S., the family drove cross-country to Palo Alto, California, where he undertook training to advance his passions for plastic and reconstructive surgery under the mentorship of Dr. Robert Chase at Stanford University. While in California, Bob became one of the early pioneers in the nascent field of microsurgery. Returning to New York, he joined the Plastic Surgery Division at Montefiore Medical Center, run by Dr. Michael Lewin, and rose to become the Chief of the Division of Plastic Surgery in 1978. Under Bob's leadership, Montefiore became the first replantation center in the Northeast. Bob turned the Division of Plastic Surgery (within the general surgery department) into one of the few full-fledged surgical departments. He was selected as the Chair of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at Montefiore/Albert Einstein and served from 1987 until 2007. He pioneered the toe- to-thumb transplantation technique, saving the firefighting career of one of his patients. He spearheaded research and advancements in microsurgery and peripheral nerve surgery, among other fields, and left his mark on everything he did. Among his many professional accomplishments, Bob founded the Journal of Reconstructive Microsurgery in 1982 and served as Editor in Chief for 25 years. He published numerous books and articles, including the Encyclopedia of Flaps, the Atlas of Microvascular Surgery, "The Ten Test" to assess sensation, the Atlas of Hand Anatomy and Clinical Implications, and the Encyclopedia of Body Sculpting After Massive Weight Loss. He was the first president and a founding member of the American Society for Reconstructive Microsurgery, president and a founding member of the American Society for Peripheral Nerve, president of the International Society of Reconstructive Microsurgery, and president of the New York Society for Surgery of the Hand. Of his many professional accolades, Life Magazine ran a cover story about his groundbreaking microsurgical achievements, he received the New York Society of Hand Surgery Lifetime Achievement Award and the American Association of Plastic Surgeons Distinguished Fellow Award. Bob was also a visionary inventor and natural teacher. He patented the widely used "Strauch clamp" to help surgically restore male fertility post-vasectomy and conducted innovative research in the field of pulsed electromagnetic fields to improve healing and lessen postoperative pain. He trained countless residents over the years and hosted memorable graduation parties with Rena at their home. He loved traveling with Rena, who accompanied him to his national and international meetings, where they made many lifelong friends. An irrepressible optimist and motivator, he encouraged his family and trainees to think big and to believe in themselves. Bob was a powerful presence in our family and in his professional life. He will be sorely missed, and we will love him always. A memorial service to celebrate his life is planned for January 14, 2024, at Beth El Synagogue Center, 1324 North Avenue, New Rochelle, NY at 11:00am. 1/3
