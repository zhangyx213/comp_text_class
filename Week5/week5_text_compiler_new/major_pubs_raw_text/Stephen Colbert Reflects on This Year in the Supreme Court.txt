Colbert referred to the court's year of bold rulings as ''a real roller-coaster ride, in that I am nauseous and scared we're all going to die.''
Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown of the previous night's highlights that lets you sleep -- and lets us get paid to watch comedy. Here are the 50 best movies on Netflix right now. 
  Environmental Hazard
  The Supreme Court held the last session of its term on Thursday and announced yet another controversial decision. This time, the court ruled to limit the Environmental Protection Agency's ability to regulate carbon emissions from power plants.
  Stephen Colbert referred to the court's year of bold calls as ''a real roller-coaster ride, in that I am nauseous and scared we're all going to die.''

  ''Today was the final day of the Supreme Court's current term and I gotta say, thank god. This must be how the Jets feel when halftime finally arrives: [imitating a Jets player] 'Well, at least we get 15 minutes when they can't kick our [expletive]!''' -- SETH MEYERS
  ''What are you thinking, Supreme Court? It's the Environmental Protection Agency -- if they can't limit the emissions, then the agency can't protect the environment. They're going to have to change what the 'P' stands for -- maybe 'Environmental Punch-Dolphins-in-the-Taint Agency.''' -- STEPHEN COLBERT
  ''With these maniacs in charge, our only hope is that the smokestacks put on a condom.'' -- STEPHEN COLBERT
  ''The Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency does not have the authority to protect the environment? So what is their job now?''-- TREVOR NOAH

  ''And by the way, by the way, just so you understand, this ruling might not just be about the carbon emissions. A lot of experts believe the logic of today's ruling makes it harder for the government to regulate anything unless Congress specifically passes a law to do it. Because you see, right now, a lot of regulations are made by agencies, like -- like the F.D.A. They will handle food, you know? The C.D.C. with public health; the B.R.B., with ignoring text messages.'' -- TREVOR NOAH
  ''Yeah, Justice Jackson made history as the first Black woman on the Supreme Court, and the first person to make people cheer for the Supreme Court in the past two weeks.'' -- JIMMY FALLON
  ''Ketanji Brown Jackson was sworn in today as the Supreme Court's 116th justice -- and then Clarence Thomas dissented against that, too.'' -- SETH MEYERS
  The Punchiest Punchlines (Vasectomy Edition)
  ''With contraception in the judicial cross hairs, folks are taking their genitals into their own hands, with men rushing to get vasectomies -- and then very slowly walking home from them.'' -- STEPHEN COLBERT
  ''According to one urologist, before the Supreme Court's ruling he received four or five vasectomy requests a day. But since the decision, that number has spiked to 12 to 18. Makes sense. The most effective forms of birth control for men are abstinence and vasectomies. They have a similar result, but there's a vas deferens.'' -- STEPHEN COLBERT

  ''I've never personally performed a vasectomy, but I'd like to try my very first one on Samuel Alito.'' -- CHELSEA HANDLER
  ''Following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, urologists have reportedly seen an uptick in requests for vasectomies. And this is weird -- from women: [imitating woman] 'His name is Dave -- I'll bring him in.''' -- SETH MEYERS
  The Bits Worth Watching
  James Corden tried his hand at being the president's assistant on Thursday's ''Late Late Show.''
