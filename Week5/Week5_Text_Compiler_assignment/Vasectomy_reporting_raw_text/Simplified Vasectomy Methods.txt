ALEXANDRIA, Virginia, April 16 -- SIGNATI MEDICAL INC., Providence, Rhode Island has been assigned a patent (No. US 11957370 B2, initially filed Nov. 7, 2023) developed by Robert A. Van Wyk, St. Pete Beach, Florida, for "Simplified vasectomy methods."
Conventional vasectomy techniques suffer from a number of disadvantages and potential complications, including, for example, a substantial risk for the development of hematomas, swelling, and post-surgical pain, a potential for spontaneous regeneration and undesired resumption of fertility, a need for a highly skilled surgical professional, as well as a long recovery period, accompanied by severe limitations on post-surgical activity. The present invention overcomes the disadvantages and deficiencies of the prior art by providing vasectomy instruments, kits, and methods that allow for a rapid, reliable, less invasive male sterilization procedure that may be readily, reliably and successfully performed by minimally skilled personnel around the world in a variety of medical settings.
