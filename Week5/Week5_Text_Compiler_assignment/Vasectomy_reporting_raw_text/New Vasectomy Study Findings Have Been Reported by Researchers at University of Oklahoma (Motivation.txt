2024 OCT 15 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Health Policy and Law Daily -- Data detailed on Surgery - Vasectomy have been presented. According to news originating from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, "In May 2022, lawmakers in Oklahoma passed House Bill 4327, which outlawed abortion after fertilization. The governor signed the bill on May 25, 2022." 
 Financial supporters for this research include NIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS), Oklahoma. 
 Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the University of Oklahoma, "It is uncertain whether these changes will motivate more men in Oklahoma to undergo vasectomy. Males seeking vasectomy were informed of the study and asked to participate. Participants filled out a survey regarding their marital status, number of children, fertility treatment history, and their influences in making the decision to pursue vasectomy. We removed the identifying information from the survey. After collection, the data was imported to a database. Medical records were investigated to confirm patients underwent the procedure. Of the 126 participants, 116 underwent vasectomy. Patients who did not undergo vasectomy tended to be older (38.4 vs. 34.2, p = 0.03). Participants who underwent vasectomy and were concerned about abortion laws tended to be married (69.7 vs. 30.3%, p = 0.04) with fewer children (1.2 vs. 2.3, p< 0.0001). When correlating specifically 'concern about abortion laws' and going through with vasectomy, the risk ratio of 1.12 (95% CI 1.04, 1.20) indicates that patients concerned about abortion laws were slightly more likely to undergo vasectomy. Over 26% of men said that their decisions were somewhat impacted by abortion law changes. The concern about abortion law changes seemed to be predictive of patients undergoing vasectomy." 
 According to the news editors, the research concluded: "Continued data collection will help determine whether there is a time-sensitive nature regarding the impact of abortion law changes on motivation to vasectomy." 
 This research has been peer-reviewed.
