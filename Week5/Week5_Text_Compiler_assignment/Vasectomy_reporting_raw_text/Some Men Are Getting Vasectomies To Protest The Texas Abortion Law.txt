A Texas doctor said his practice has seen a nearly 15% increase in vasectomies as men try to push back against the state's abortion law, The Washington Post (WaP0) reported Sunday.
Koushik Shaw, a doctor who practices at the Austin Urology Institute, told  his practice saw a roughly 15% increase in scheduled vasectomies following the state's Sept. 1 abortion ban.
Shaw told the outlet patients are coming in, saying “'Hey, I'm actually here because some of these changes that [Gov. Greg] Abbott and our legislature have passed that are really impacting our decision-making in terms of family planning,' so that was a new one for me as a reason - the first time, patients are citing a state law as their motivating factor.”

Texas clinics aren't the only places seeing men choose vasectomies, with Florida urologist Doug Stein marketing the procedure as “an act of Love” for their partners and “the ultimate way to be a good man,” according to the WaPo.
Boston family medicine doctor Sarah Miller referred to the “trend” as “remarkable ... in the family planning community of recognizing and promoting vasectomy and birth control for men,” according to the report.
“It warms my heart to hear men say, 'I am so nervous, but I know this is NOTHING compared to what my wife has gone through,'” Stein told the WaPo.
Stein and family medicine doctor Esgar Guarín even launched a “Responsible Men's Clubs” chat for men who have had the procedure can share information about their sexual performance and explain how it “doesn't take away their manhood, but in fact makes them a better man,” Guarín reportedly said.

Have a vasectomy' during a demonstration against Poland's near-total ban on abortion in Berlin on November 7, 2020. - Mass protests began in Poland in October when Poland's Constitutional Court ruled that an existing law allowing the abortion of damaged foetuses was "incompatible" with the constitution.
