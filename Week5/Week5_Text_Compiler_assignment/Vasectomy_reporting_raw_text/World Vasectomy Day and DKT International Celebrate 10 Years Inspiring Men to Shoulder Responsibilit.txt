 , one of the world's largest providers of family planning, HIV/AIDS, and safe abortion products and services, is proud to continue its support of  . This year the organization marks its 10th anniversary, with events around the globe throughout November in recognition of this milestone.
"World Vasectomy Day is more than just a day; it's an important movement to encourage and educate people globally about an often-overlooked form of family planning, and that is encouraging men to share in reproductive responsibilities and become an active part of the conversation," says Chris Purdy, CEO of DKT International.
Demonstrating WVDs commitment to being the largest male-focused family planning movement in history, more than 1,000 participating medical personnel from 30+ countries will provide 15,000 vasectomies in the U.S. and globally throughout the month.
Each year since 2013, WVD has brought its headquarters to a different country. Mexico has been chosen as the 2022 partner because of its unparalleled commitment to this movement. Through an agreement with the Mexican Ministry of Health (MoH), 400 doctors will mobilize to perform 10,000 vasectomies in all 32 Mexican states. The MoH's mobile vasectomy clinic will also be placed at the border of Mexico and Texas, where they will offer free vasectomies for migrants heading north and Americans seeking free services coming south.
Additionally, vasectomies will be provided by mobile clinics in the American Midwest. Planned Parenthood in Missouri will host WVD for a portion of the Midwestern Road trip, when WVD's Medical Advisory Board member, Dr. Esgar Guarin will take his 24-foot mobile trailer throughout Iowa and Missouri and perform 100 free vasectomies. The mobile clinic will be in Missouri from November 2-5 and in Iowa from November 14-18.
WVD will host vasectomy clinics via specially planned events in the Philippines. DKT's offices around the world will also be supporting the occasion with their events focused on the need for men to shoulder some of the responsibility for family planning.
WVD events throughout November include:

24-Hour Global Celebration: The Global Celebration will travel across time zones from December 2nd, to interact with leaders in family planning, men receiving a vasectomy, women in support of men, and sexual and reproductive rights activists. Various DKT country programs will also be participating in the global celebration, including:
