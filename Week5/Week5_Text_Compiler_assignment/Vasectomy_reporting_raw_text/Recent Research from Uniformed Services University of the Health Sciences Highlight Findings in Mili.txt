2024 JUN 13 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Defense & Aerospace Daily -- Investigators discuss new findings in Military Medicine. According to news reporting from Bethesda, Maryland, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, "Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization (Dobbs decision) has already had profound impact on reproductive health care in the United States. Some studies have reported increased incidence of vasectomy after the Dobbs decision." 
 Financial support for this research came from Center for Health Services Research and faculty of the Uniformed Services University Department of Preventive Medicine and Biostatistics - Department of Defense, Defense Health Agency. 
 The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, "The Military Health System (MHS) provides a unique opportunity to evaluate this relationship in a universally insured, geographically representative population. We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study of vasectomies among all male beneficiaries in the MHS, ages 18 to 64, from 2018 to 2022. Beneficiaries receiving a vasectomy were identified via billing data extraction from the MHS Data Repository (MDR). Descriptive statistics of demographic factors of all those receiving a vasectomy in the study period were evaluated. Crude and multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate for differences in demographic variables in those receiving a vasectomy pre-Dobb's decision as compared to after the Dobb's decision. The total number of men receiving a vasectomy each month over the study period was analyzed, as were the numbers in a state immediately implementing abortion access restrictions (Texas), and one without any restrictions on abortion access (Virginia). Our analysis found that men receiving a vasectomy post-Dobbs decision were more likely to be younger, unmarried, and of junior military rank than prior to the Dobbs decision. In the months following the Dobbs decision in 2022 (June-December), there was a 22.1% increase in vasectomy utilization as compared to the averages of those months in 2018-2021. Further, it was found that the relative increase in vasectomy after the Dobbs decision was greater in Texas (29.3%) compared to Virginia (10.6%)." 
 According to the news reporters, the research concluded: "Our findings highlight the impact of the Dobbs decision on reproductive health care utilization outside of abortion."
