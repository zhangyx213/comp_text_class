I found a document that has never been revealed before, where Roosevelt on his first day in office was tempted to create his own private army of veterans, the way Mussolini did, because there was a lot of uncertainty about these terrifying bank runs.}

Nobody comes in there unless it`s by the president`s invitation. People have a hard time ever telling the president what they really mean. And you`re cut off, you have the whole federal government at your disposal. I think it`s very easy for any president to almost cut himself off from reality.

There are only two choices. You can either raise taxes to pay for war, or you can put it on a credit card for our children to pay. There are no other options.}

And he was a little bitter at the fact that the wealthy were not appreciative of what he had done for them. He had saved them in 1933, saved their fortunes. He compared it -- excuse me -- to a life guard who saves a drowning man in a silk hat, and then four years later the man comes back and says, "hey, where`s my hat?" And by that time, they had become very critical of him and had forgotten that they would have been in the poorhouse if he hadn`t rescued capitalism.}

The New Dealers, his liberal base, wanted him to have a government takeover of the banks. The fallback position were postal banks. Can you imagine if the post office ran all our banking?
